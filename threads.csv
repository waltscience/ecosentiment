"NSF/NIH grants as postdocs Not a rant/vent, just asking for advice. If a post-doc receives a grant from NSF (I'm curious about NIH too), can he/she take the grant with them to a faculty position?  I know post-docs can't be PI's on fed grants. I'd like to get some advice or hear from post-docs who have received grants from NSF/NIH as co-pi's. Thanks!  (1) Good question. I also don't understand this. (2) I think the answer is ""officially"" no, ""unofficially"" yes, depending upon the agreement with the PI on paper. I can't, for example, use grant money to cover overhead at my new institution but I can use the money to pay for a grad student, etc to work on the project. 3) OP here, thanks. So in your case, does the grad student get paid from your post-doc institution or from your new faculty position? In other words, does the money (minus the overhead) get transferred to your new faculty institution? (4) #2 here, yes the grad student is paid off the grant for my postdoc institution, as are expenses, etc. Nothing is transferred to the new institution.
(5) I believe postdocs can be PIs on fed grants, but it is up the institution to 'vouch for' the PI status. My current postdoc institution has granted me PI status so that I can apply for these. I have no experience with the transfer status, but it is our understanding that it would transfer if I change institutions (but I could not be double-paid, so the postdoc salary would probably be divided into summer salary support for me and support for grad student). However, I re-emphasize that the latter part on transfers is pure speculation as I have not crossed that bridge yet. Hopefully more people will add to the thread with their experience. (6) If your co-PI (the lead) lets you take some money, it can be transferred (likely paying another overhead at the new institution). Similar scenario to a faculty member switching institutions. (7) I'm in the same boat as 5. I am a co-PI on an NSF grant awaiting decision. My understanding was that funds can be used at either institution for grad student lines or hiring a new post-doc. (8) I'm a postdoc on a NSF grant I wrote at an institution where Post-docs cannot be PIs. However, if I get a faculty job, I can be reassigned as a CO-PI and can take some/all of the grant with me pending the arrangments made with my advisor. I do not have to run grad students or a postdoc through the current institution. Funds for those salaries/benefits/assoc overhead can be transfered to the new institution. The catch is you have to have had a clear conversation about this when you designed the project with your advisor. In my case, we both agreed that future postdocs and students on the grant would go with me and that everything else would stay at the current institution. 10) I'm confused. Some of you say you can transfer, some say no, same say you are PI's, some no...@8, the clear conversation and agreement with advisor, is it on paper? Is the sponsored research office at your institution aware of your agreement? Any obstacles? I envision a lot of red tape (if not opposition) from the sponsored research office at my (and many) institutions? 11) It depends on the institution. My school allowed me to be a PI on an NSF grant (with my advisor being a Co-PI). I put two-years of postdoc salary into my grant and I got a job offer from some place else without spending the entire postdoc salary. I wrote the grant and I did all the work and it's therefore my grant to take. Of course, I was able to get the grant because my postdoc school sponsored me, but it is my understanding that I can take the entire grant. There is also some differences in the percentage of indirect between the current school and the school I will be moving to. NSF has a procedure for such grant transfer, and it's usually a three-party procedure among NSF, the research office at your postdoc school and the research office at your future school. If you are able to score a federal grant as a postdoc, by all means do it. It will open up a lot of doors for your career. 12) Lots of great advice and interesting stories. Thanks for sharing everyone! At my school, postdocs are not allowed to be PI's or Co-PI's on grants. My postdoc advisor is cool with me writing a NSF grant proposal anyway but I'm concerned about what happens if we get the grant and I land a TT position next year (wishful thinking, I know). Ideally, I would love to take the grant with me (I think my advisor would be cool with that) but, if I'm not even a co-PI on the grant, I'm not sure if it would be at all possible. Does anyone have any insight or experience with this situation? Thanks!!! 13) Well, in your case, I am afraid that you won't be able to take any money. In order to take funding, you need to be in control of the portion of a grant (being PI, co-PI or a responsible party for a subaward contract). Even if you were actively involved in writing a grant, it is not your grant to mess with, it's whoever the PI was. Say, your PI put you as a postdoc on the grant you helped writing and you got a TT job. You wont' be able to take any money because you are not responsible for managing the grant. Your PI will need to find a replacement postdoc, but he is in no way obliged to give you any money. Transferring grant is a tricky matter because every school is different in terns of indirect cost and because it's federal money (tax money) you can't simply give it away or move however you want. PI has to talk to the program officers to transfer, and it's pain in the ass. So, just think that your grant writing experience was an added bonus, because not all postdocs get to do that. Hopefully your PI and you will be in good terms and have the good collaborations going (for example, your PI can continue your research using his students and his research dollars at his institution under your supervision). When you eventually get a job, you will be able to write your own grant and spend it however you want. Patience is a virtue in this game of postoc. 14) That sucks #13 and OP! 
15) Based on 14's post, I'd say you're better off saving your proposal until you're able to have PI status somewhere. Sure, you may gain experience from writing proposal but, if you can't take the money with you, there's really no point and you'd be wasting your time. You would benefit more from writing a review paper or another pub. Most of us (postdocs) already have experience writing proposals. What matters at this stage is $$$$$. I sympathize with you, #12. It really does suck that your school doesn't recognize you as a PI or even a Co-PI.
16) Too bad NSF doesn't offer PIG (Postdoctoral Improvement Grants) funding. It would be nice to have a small grant opportunity for postdocs. 17) PIG funding from NSF would look great on my CV. lol ;) (18) In all seriousness, though, the funding opportunities for EEB-type postdocs are pretty pitiful unless you do biomed-related work (NIH) or bioinformatics (NSF). What about the rest of us? I don't know why NSF doesn't go back to a competitive general biology postdoc fellowship system, excluding biomed research, which NIH covers. Otherwise many of us write grants for our postdoc sponsors and can't take them with us or do the work. That is why we write them, in addition to ""getting experience."" The system at NSF needs to change.
19) If you are mostly concerned about the money, you can be a ""Senior Personnel"" on a grant instead of a Co-PI. That way the funds aren't tied to your institution, but to the work you are doing with them.
20) I've never heard of that #19 (I've also never applied to full grant!). Can you tell us a little more about this option? Say a postdoc who can not be PI or Co-PI writes a grant with their advisor, if listed as a ""Senior Personnel"", can the postdoc take the grant $ with them when they get hired as a TT faculty elsewhere? I think that's what concerns many of us. 
21) Good question #20. I have another situation that maybe some of you can give some insight. I'm a postdoc at a school where postdocs can NOT be PI's or Co-PI's. I have a collaborator (Tenured faculty) at a university that would like to co write a grant proposal with me. Postdocs can be Co-PI's at her institution. Can I go ahead and be Co-PI on the grant submitted through my collaborator's school while being a postdoc at my current instituion? Anyone have experience with this type of situation? 
22) I would guess not 21. You don't have any technical position at your collaborator's school, so it is unlikely they will go through the hoops and paperwork of giving you PI status there when you aren't currently affiliated. I'm in a similar situation and feel like I have my hands tied. If someone knows of a place that will allow PI status for someone not affiliated with the school, they should let us know so that we can all see about implementing it elsewhere! 
(23) You need to be granted adjunct status at your colleagues institution. Then you can co-PI the grant. Had the same experience and made it work that way.
24) #19 again - I'm not sure if it is only for certain grants, but I will hopefully be getting some funding that way (if we get the grant). I am postdocing right now but start my TT job AFTER the grant deadline (so I can't co-PI). If you look at the NSF grant preparation instructions, it should be there under ""Senior Personnel"". 
(25) I see that there is much confusion in this matter. Let me try to clarify a few things. I am doing a postdoc at an institution where postdocs are allowed to become a PI, and I got a TT job and I will be transferring my grant to my new institution. So I think I have a pretty good idea of how this thing works. First off, NSF defines ""Senior Personnel"" as investigators who are responsible for managing the fund. PI and co-PI belong to the category of Senior Personnel. Other players in the grant are major collaborators and contributors, postdocs, technicians and students. Once the grant proposal gets funded, NSF will transfer money to the school where the senior personnel works. Money comes in either in the form of multiple payments spread throughout the grant duration or one time payment of the whole grant amount. Well, actually it's not the cash that comes in, but the agreement to pay. You as a senior personnel do not handle money. You are responsible, but it's your sponsored research office (SRO) that handles your grant. Accounting is a big part of grant handling. Having said all these, two main questions everybody is interested are: can you take your grant somewhere else? and can you apply for a grant as non-senior personnel? The answer to the first question is yes only if you are a senior personnel, meaning if you are PI or co-PI in an institution where your SRO handles your portion of the grant. If you are listed as something else in the grant, regardless of your contribution, you cannot take your grant. The PI on the grant CAN make a subaward from the grant to you if it is desired. But, it's not your call, but the PI's. The answer to the second question is no. You cannot apply for a federal grant if your institution doesn't give you the status of a faculty position. Hold your best ideas until you get a job. A note from my own experience: The school that I did my postdoc had the indirect cost of 50%. To simply put, if the direct cost of my grant is 100K, and school would take 50K, and the total size of the grant will become 150K. As a postdoc, I am very protective of my grant and I really don't like to see the school which I will eventually leave take 50% indirect. If I were a TT faculty, the story would be different. The school initially invests in you in terms of start-up fund and I see the indirect cost as a way for the school to get the return on its initial investment. However, as a postdoc, the school didn't really invest anything (other than office space), but takes the indirect anyways. I see this as the main drawback of applying for the grant as a postdoc. By all means, go for it if you are in a place where you can apply. But be aware of all the caveats that come with this. 
26) Wow! Thanks #25, you've clarified many of my concerns. I agree with you and #15. I'm not desperate for the $ right now and definitely don't need the hassle of writing a proposal anyways.",UPR Any word on status of the UPR search? Any one get any contact from the SC? I read below about the strike and such but want to know if anyone has contacted or been contacted by the SC. Thanks!  Heard from a friend that the job search was canceled.,"unqualified! Although I am on the market I have recently served on two search committees.  Please, oh please do not apply for jobs you aren't remotely qualified for.  Don't get me wrong...I too sometimes apply for jobs that are a little outside my immediate area of expertise and interests.  But there is a limit to the madness.  If you are a medical doctor studying (animal) cell biology, for example, don't waste the search committee's time by applying for a plant ecology position.  It's irritating.  I was on a SC for  cell and molec biologist recently.  We received 124 applications.  Over half of them were not even remotely close to what we were looking for, and that fact was very clear based on the advertisement for the position.  I understand your frustration with this, but really, it only takes 5 minutes to weed these people out.  It's not the 60 unqualified candidates that make an SC's job difficult, it's the fact that there are 60 ell-qualified candidates! 2) OP here.  Actually, it takes even less time than that (most of the time at least).  But 3 minutes per unqualified app times 60 apps equals 3 hours of wasted time.  Not a huge deal, I realize, but it is somewhat irritating, particularly when it's apparent that the applicant didn't even bother reading the job ad. 3) Fair point, that is a lot of time over that many job applications.  Mentors needs to advise quality over quantity when it comes to applying for jobs.  Applying to 100 jobs instead of 10 doesn't increase your odds at all when you're only qualified for those 10. 4) OP here.  I'll be honest: after being on search committees I truly feel sorry for some applicants, who obviously never received any advice or help on how to put together a decent application.  Some of the things I've seen (just in terms of basic grammar issues, misspelled words, and strange statements) have really surprised me.  It really does make me sad for those people because they are going to have a really hard time finding a decent job. 5) I don't feel sad for any of them and I don't blame their advisors (or lack of advice). You make it seem like these are 15 year old kids applying for their first job. The reason bad applicants' applications are crappy is because they didn't take the time or put in the effort to figure out what they needed to do to get the job that they wanted...or...didn't take the time or put in the effort to figure out how to construct a good application. Either way, most of these applicants for TT faculty positions are in their late 20s at the youngest and the mass majority in their early to mid 30s. If you haven't figured out how to get a job by the time you are in your early to mid 30s I don't feel sad for you.  6)  ""If you haven't figured out how to get a job by the time you are in your early to mid 30s I don't feel sad for you.""  Must have been nice to have grown up in a job market where you weren't competing with 200 people for each position. 7) OP here.  In response to 5:  yeah, I guess I just, you know, care about people.  Not all of the poorly-written apps I've seen can be explained away as simple laziness. 8) Keep using that as a crutch 6...if that's what helps you sleep better at night. 9) 7: so what other explainaation can be given for the poor apps that you have seen. Lack of publications? Terrible teaching statements? Terrible research statements? Bad cover letter? Lack of teaching experience? No funding? Can't all of these be fixed by time and effort (except the funding part, which I don't judge applicants on at all; more or less the potential for funding is what I look for)? I don't feel bad for people who submit a poorly written application (teaching/research statements and cover letters), with one publication, and no teaching experience. I just say to myself, ""this person has not done what was necessary to get a job at my university at this juncture of his/her career."" The end. I don't cry in my bed at night over the fact that said indivdiual will probably have to post-doc or pick up an instructor's position (while trying to stay active in research) for a few years before getting a TT position with time allocation for research. 10) A non-biologist, non-academic friend of mine kept telling me that I should broaden my scope with my job apps and inlcude positions outside my expertise. The example she gave was her husband, a college drop-out working in IT, who was able to obtain a job he had no background in, after completing a weekend crash-course. I wasn't sure whether to laugh or cry at her story. I just wish it were that easy for ecologists to get any jobs we wish. 11) Stop selling ecologists short! I'm sure you could get the same job as the dropout IT drone, but (as you say) that might not be a job you would want. Most ecologists I know have far more broadly useful skills than they give themselves credit for, and could fairly easily get a job in the nonacademic world. It just won't be doing ecology, most likely. But it might pay more...",new wiki any ideas for the new wiki? i vote for the same format as this year. 2) Same. 3) Same...thanks for the great resource!! 4) Same. This wiki was extremely helpful.  I start my awesome tenure track position in September. 5) Same. Thanks! 6) Same for me. I wonder if there is a way to set up a chat room to discuss in real time.  ,"You reject me? No I reject you  This is a rant. Mostly. One the one hand, I am now happy to say that I got a great position with a great start-up at an R1. One the other hand this whole job search process has killed me. Its like snake venom digesting you from the inside. That survey only asked about how many jobs people applied to - well there was no category in there for me. In four years on the market, I applied for over 130 jobs, and intervied 6 times on campus. On my interviews, I saw the biggest fucking jerks - racists, sexists, elitists and any other type of sons of bitches out there. On four occasions I was not offered the position because of political reasons inside the department against me. I am well accomplished, but I am from a less than desirable background - ethnically, socially, academically. One fucker actually asked me how students at his university will respect me knowing that I went to a lowly school (according to him anyway). Another joker once told me that I had paid someone off to add big publications to my profile on google scholar - as he was not able to find full text PDF!! (you cant make this stuff up). I want to say it made me a cynic, but I am better than that. Why are these asshole out there? They are sitting pretty with six-figure salaries with nice successful lives and labs. Why are they so bitter and snide? So my response to them is this - fuck you. If I believed in hell, I would say go to hell. You are  miserable, whimpering shit - you have created a personal hell-space right where you are standing. Your hell is to live with yourself and feel your false pride and fake superiority.  How that has become your signature character under the pretense of an academic. No you cannot reject me - I reject you and your culture. There is something deeply wrong with the way this is currently working and if any one else here feels this or has ever experienced this - I ask you to bring about a change. I ask you to fight for the dignity of fellow academics - on both sides of the table. I have decided I will never treat a candidate the way I was treated, and when I am on a search committee I will make sure we treat the applicants as human beings with feelings, anxiety, and a responsibility to his/her dependents  "," 1)  Well, folks, is this it?  Are we done for the 2013/2014 job season?  Time to come to terms with another year of where we are and start to figure out how we can increase our chances for the 2014/2015 job season starting this summer?  Are there still any new, decent tenure-track positions coming out or are we just down to replacement and temporary positions at this point?  What have we learned this year?  How do we make ourselves more marketable for next year?  Time to suck it up and pump out more pubs, present more data, and write more grant proposals? 2) I think we've been done for a few months now, sorry to say.  My guess is what we do in the next two months will make more of a difference come Sept - Dec than any other time. 3) Personally I haven't applied for anything since early January. I am still keeping my eye out on ""alternative"" jobs, but as far as TT stuff goes, the season does seem to be over.  4) I had a job application due yesterday (4/15/14).  5) OP here.  I haven't applied for anything since early in the spring/last fall, but I still have two outstanding apps that I'm on the short list for. Doubt they will work out, but there's always some small chance.  Haven't seen much of interest for the last month or so.  Time to focus on home improvements and CV improvements until later in the summer and then start the game all over again. 6) I didn't begin appyling until midJan. and submitted a total of 17 apps. I have a campus interview at end of April, campus interviewed last week, and 3 phone interviews in April- so I'm holding out hope for an attractive offer. New postings seem to have stopped around late March though. I'll be glad when the dust settles- however it settles.  7) nope, we are not done.  THis year is dragging on a lot longer than most years.  I've submitted over 50, just got my second on campus.  First was in Aug, second in May.  Amazing.  Unfortunately, this is a job that is not exactly attractive to most. 8) It's close to done, but not done. I think some of the subfields go longer- in my subfield, it's all been late- I even had one due at the end of March, phone interviews started last week, and have had campus interviews from mid-Mar through late last week. GOD I HOPE it's not over and I hear something. I've had interviews at 4 institutions and it'skilled my productivity over the last two months. UGH.  9) look at the situation in Illinois everyone.  They may have mass retirements in June and be forced to open searches at the last minute. see article in the Houston Chronicle, Chronicle of Higher ed, etc.  This is because the had a typo in legislatiion that had the start of a program as 2013 instead of 2014!!!! 10) #9 This isn't going to do much. A) There likely won't be a lot of Eco/Evo positions (it only covers public unis of course) B) I would bet they will fix it (they have until May 31 - the end of the legislative session). I would be surprised if they advertised before that and C) If it does produce positions, they are likely to be NTT, adjunct jobs. They would have to get a ton of searches approved by HR rapidly. Always be searching for jobs but I wouldn't bet too much on this. 11) OP here.  I also never stop looking for job opportunities, but seems like if places haven't hired TT faculty for the Fall by now, they must be running way behind, as they are only giving folks about 3 months to plan a move to a new job.  Not much time if you have to sell a house, but, then again, when did employers ever care about inconveniencing new hires. ;)  12) I think they are running well behind.  I just got a second interview offer in two weeks, which makes no sense to me at, I thought they were all done by now.  Maybe the lag is because of the budget battles in congress.  A lot of positions were not posted until after that was finalized. 13) One more interview coming up :-)","Stop sending rejections during otherwise happy times, e.g., Saturday night....(just happened). 2) Ditto 1, way to kick off Friday night!","Repeated Job postings from last year There are a couple of jobs posting this year that were repeats of last year. For example, the Evolution position at UBC and the Ecology position at Darmouth. Do anyone know if these are failed searches last year or are those department expanding in those areas?  2) UBC was a failed search.  The top picks wanted spousal hires, which the department could not accomodate.","FYI everyone. According to an expert on the discussion tab you are naive if you have any conversation ever with a search committee that involves anything related to being a human being. 2) lol 3) some bitter people over there. 4) Bitter? Well, realistic.There's a whole list of things most people don't learn in grad school about how to land a job and major funding independently of an advisor's name. 5) There's nothing wrong with having a personal conversation.  I've had conversations about hiking, canoeing, painting and good books during interviews. I draw the line about what my spouse does or what the spouse of the interviewer does. Or their children. A friend of mine was asked if she had kids, which was horrible because she recently had a miscarriage. That's what this is about. 6) Completely agree 5. There is a gradient and much of that gradient involves friendly conversation. If someone says, ""what does your spouse do"" it may not be malicious, but there is reason to not reply. Yes, 4, bitter.  7) Seven out of Seven insitutions agree!! You should ask female candidates whether they have a family.  Happy mother's day, peeps.  ", Sure you want the faculty job? Look at the angst on Twitter about NSF funding and the quirkiness of preproposal invitations. 2) meh. People need to focus on the positives. One way to do that is mute the usual suspects on twitter that complain about everything. Stay positive!,"Oy, I had a campus interview at the beginning of March. It is a teaching-heavy school, and their spring break fell after my interview, but I haven't heard a single peep from them in over a month now. I thought everything went well, but this radio silence is driving me slightly nuts. Especially since my funding got denied for extending my current postdoc, and there are so few jobs left. 2) I am in the same boat! Wonder if we interviewed at the same place ;D What region were you in? 3) Silence just confirms your worst fears. You were not chosen and do not get to pass the tenure-track go. Hopefully the 1st choice turns it down and they get to you. 1 again) I was in the southeast, @2! 2) 2 again - I'm the northeast :D There's all possibility that they already made the offer to the first choice, but with later positions (interview in march is later, I think) and at teaching-focused places, offers get turned down all the time. There's hope.  4)  Doesn't sound promising, BUT the fact that you have not yet gotten a rejection letter means they aren't ready to burn any bridges with you, which is good.  They may be negotiating with another candidate, but he/she may turn it down, so hang in there. 5) Similar situation here. Their interviews were super strung out -- mine was first week of March, then their next one was I think two weeks later, then spring break, then their third interview I think the last week of March. Wish I could have gone last to reduce time waiting but alas schedule did not permit. Now needing to commit to other (soft money research and adjunct) positions in a couple weeks so really starting to get anxious to know for sure either way. ... Any updates on your end #1 or #2? 6) Nope! I was a public R2/SLAC in the northeast. I suspect they made an offer to a first choice, but am hopeful. 7) 1-again, same as previous, still no word so I'm assuming they've made an offer and are in negotiations. Would be really mentally-helpful to get confirmation of that, though, instead of the current speculation!  8) #5, if you need to commit to other positions, this is something you can tell the chair and ask for a direct reply. Usually even if they are in the process of negotiation with another candidate, if you have other offers, they will be more upfront with you on the process. However, if there is no other offers or other commitments, the only thing you can do is wait. It is frustrating, truly is, but sometimes the process takes several weeks to two months after the last candidate interviewed. The faculty needs to vote, the chair has to go to the dean to confirm the hire, and negotiation with the dean on what to offer before you get a phone call. In general, I think it would be reasonable to wait for at least 6-8 weeks if you are not the first choice on their list. You could still get an offer after 3 months if the first choice did not accept the offer, so don't give up yet!  9) Agreed - do not give up, many/most of the first choices in a search will receive multiple offers, most of which they will turn down.  The search committee can then move on to their second choice, if there is one.  This can take months - I speak from experience having just declined multiple offers. 10) Did the OP ever hear about an offer??","2018 jobs Just saw a position advertised today with a (January) 2018 start date.

Last year's ""peak"" post date was around August or September, I think, which was a little earlier than the previous year's season. 3) There are at least 3 TT (ish) jobs that have recently posted that I think would probably be appropriate to add on a new 2017-2018 wiki?

If you like a great food and bourbon scene, ESA will be a blast. 4) Saw a thread on Twitter several months ago by an LGBT member of our community reminding people that not going to ESA out of allegiance with the LGBT community is invalidating to LGBT scientists in Louisville and other cities that tend to be in more conservative states. Better is to show up and also take the time to do something that improves our community. This doesn't have to do with feelings of safety (or lack thereof) but is a good thing to keep in mind. I also agree that Louisville is a cool city. 5) My understanding is it's not about feelings about safety; it's about punishing KY for it's repressive laws and some state laws like (California) preventing funds being spent in KY. 6) echoing what others say, Louisville is a relatively progressive place, much more so than many places in the North or West (it's had local laws barring LGBT discrimination for decades and is represented in Congress by progressive John Yarmuth), but do understand the travel bans/reluctance in regards to state anti-LGBT laws. Meanwhile, nobody says boo about traveling to Iowa where white nationalist Steve King has been sent to Congress for years... 7) We live in a country that elected Donald Trump. I think that horse has already left the barn. 8) Serious question: am I betraying my LGBTQIA+ non-binary relatives/sisters/brothers in ecology by going? 9) Fair question. I'd be willing to bet most of the money you would spend goes to local businesses and cities, not the state. The lodging tax, for instance, is usually quite local. 10) We could also do research beforehand to find out which small businesses (especially restaurants) are inclusive and give them our business 11) @10, that is a lovely idea! I wonder if the Dynamic Ecology blog would be interested in the list as a guest post. They sometimes do restaurant recommendations for whichever city Ecology is in. 12) I get the desire to boycott states with anti-LGBT (I'm a lesbian myself!), but I do think it can edge towards dismissiveness of the entire south/conservative states. There are plenty of us who live in the south, already. Louisville is not any less safe than other major cities in the US, and the CA law that prevents funds from being spent in KY end up doing more damage to people's careers, than the state gov't. That said, I would urge conference organizers in the future to be careful about where events are located - I recently passed on a conference in Russia, for instance, because of the very real, active hostility to queer people there. 13) I feel heartbroken from reading this. I wish this post didn't have to exist. Much love for y'all.  14) When did ""We're here; we're queer; get used to it"" become ""I'm not setting foot in your state""?  Also, boycotting ESA in Louisville doesn't make any sense; the amount of cash ESA will contribute to the Kentucky state economy is essentially just a rounding error.  To the extent that anyone is actually being penalized, it is really the locals in Louisville (which leaned Democrat in 2016).  Louisville is the center for the Fairness Campaign, and the mayor of Louisville (a Democrat) spoke out against anti-LGBT discrimination.  Louisville is already voting against the Republicans on the whole, so the boycott puts basically zero pressure on anyone who actually needs to be persuaded.  If you're avoiding ESA because it's in Louisville, it seems to me that you're just publicly playing holier-than-thou without actually considering the situation on the ground. x6 .  15) I live in a city that has similar dynamics to Louisville (pro LGBTQIA in conservative state).  Seeing people out and proud around town has done a lot to change the minds of local folks who grew up very conservative.   Do what you feel safe doing above all.   But know that you can have an impact if you do make the choice to attend and be open. 16) @14 apparently doesn't understand how state economies work. Because of taxes, supporting Louisville businesses means more money going to the Republican-controlled state coffers. 17) @16: and US federal taxes currently go in part to support a Republican-held executive branch; I'm kind of afraid to ask what you think should be done about that. A theory of political change based on the proposition ""anything anybody does that results in taxes being paid to Republican-held governments is Bad regardless of its other effects"" is an...unusual theory of political change.   18) And #16 is apparently completely clueless about the total amount of tax levied in Kentucky and why #14 specifically says that the contribution of ESA to the state economy is therefore no more than a rounding error.  But hey, 14, keep on clucking. 19) It looks like everyone now agrees that going to ESA this year supports Kentucky's economy. @17 and @18 are free to ignore this reality on the basis that such support is a ""rounding error"". Presumably they also follow this logic when it comes to voting in elections, buying products in stores, and investing in companies. Hopeful others have the guts to stand up for their principles. 20) @19: way to bring about the Revolution by calling every LGBT person who lives and works in Louisville (and so pays taxes to the state government) gutless and unprincipled, no matter who they vote for or what other actions they take. 21) Does this mean we should be boycotting the US as a whole to protest Trump's presidency? How do those of us based in the US do that? Not attend any US conferences? 22) I haven't set foot in CA since voters passed Prop 8 in 2008... 23) I love to hop on an airplane and blow a few tons of greenhouse gases and other pollutants into the upper atmosphere, leading to numerous impacts on the natural environment and human health, so that I can waste time hobnobbing with other members of the upper middle class and feel morally superior because I live in a state with slightly less regressive politics. 24) Geez. Perhaps not surprisingly, this thread took a REAL turn.","Would you apply to a more ideal opportunity after receiving an offer? I was recently fortunate to receive an offer at a great University. Its not the greatest offer as far as start-ups go, and they are very firm with the money. I’ve been negotiating and it’s been a slow process resolving the major issues regarding space and facilities but I think we recently come up with an agreeable solution. There are a number of aspects I really don’t like, namely, complete lack of student support (must be hired directly to grant), and not much money on the start-up to afford instrumentation. However, it is a great place to get your academic career going, even if the start-up is not so compelling! With that said, both my spouse and I are also not thrilled with the location, and we predict that we will look to move on after a few years. Today I saw a job ad posted at a much better place in a more ideal location, which would be better professionally and personally. What are your feelings about submitting an application after receiving an offer during negotiations, but have not accepted or committed yet. Should I do what is best for me? There’s no telling if it will lead to anything, but I’m wondering what you would do. 2) Go for it. You have no idea whether this new ad will turn into anything so no harm in throwing your hat in and seeing what happens. 3) Having been screwed over by my deptment as a TT-prof in what I thought was my DREAM JOB, I've learned that you ALWAYS should apply for better jobs. But if they catch you, you are going to be persona non grata. So do it on the down low....but do it! 4) Do it. I've said this on here before...why is it that academics treat jobs differently than people in business? No one would question a business person taking a better job. If biology faculty start treating their jobs more like business people, maybe universities will start making the quality of jobs better in order to retain good faculty. 5) I would quit an academic job the day before it starts to take my dream job. I'd quit in the middle of the semester. If the university cares about the students, make my current job/offer my dream job. 6) OP here, thank you for input. Its reassuring to hear from several people that our personal and professional needs should come first, I hate academic guilt! Yes I will apply and keep it on the DL and see what happens. In the mean time I'll move forward with my other offer full steam ahead!","I understand that everybody has a hard time at the moment, but still, what a kick in the guts. Went through the whole interview process and told I was the top candidate (at a top 100 ranked university) but that the position could not be funded due to COVID. Has this happened to anyone else? 2) I am so sorry. I can't even imagine what that is like. We should have a dictionary key that simply acknowledges everything that is going on in the world, maybe Unrest Everywhere and Massive Covid Deaths But... (UEaMCDB). That way, we could just write: UEaMCDB I just lost my position at a top university. 3) Yeah, @2, it was a very weird feeling, being simulatenously told your the top candidate (after being rejected SO many times) but that there's now no job. A lot of people have it worse, for sure, of course. 4) No wisdom here, but I am SO sorry. x2 5) For OP, there are currently two positions listed as ""offer rescinded"" in the faculty jobs tab -- I don't know the specific circumstances but these may have also been covid-related. I am so sorry. 6) @OP - Yes, I had a similar experience (although in my case the university will re-assess their situation late in the year and could theoretically make an offer then, I guess); it's a weird, disappointing feeling. 7) @6 oh, that's good news, at least! I don't think that's the case for mine (1) or at least it wasn't mentioned 7) 6 again. Thinking of you, OP, and everyone facing hopelessness and anxiety at the moment. Fingers crossed that something even better will come up!","2020-2021 Job board? Is there still a plan to start a new board for the next season?  2) I was just about to ask that myself.  I'm sure it will be depressing just how few jobs will be posted there, but it would be interesting to have that documented.  AP) I was working on it last night, hope to test & have the new one up soon."
"Rude search committees I have seriously had it with search committees and their rudeness to people who interview and don't get the offer. I've gotten tons of nice rejection letters from places where I didn't make the first cut - why can't I get a nice letter from places where I interview? Would it be that hard to send an email to your interviewees saying ""We liked you but you didn't get the job?"" Shit, I'll take ""You didn't get the job."" Job #1 - didn't inform me that I didn't get the job until I sent an email inquiring; then I got the rudest, curtest response ever that said basically ""We hired someone else, thank you for your interest."" WTF? The punchline: I went to the wiki to update that the job was filled, only to find that the SC chair had beaten me to it by a few minutes. Was this his cute little way of avoiding telling candidate #3 that they were rejected too? And then job #2 didn't send me a rejection either; the only way I know I'm not in the running for that job anymore is because of the wiki. Seriously, SC members, WE KNOW YOU'RE READING: STOP BEING SUCH ASSHOLES. (1) I haven't encountered any outright rudeness like the OP reports, but in my experience, the school does not want to inform the other candidates that they did not get the job until the ink is dry on the contract with the top choice. I understand why they do this, but it's really tough to be at the other end. There is no excuse for not informing the other candidates at all! In fact, I think a phone call rather than a letter or email is appropriate post-interview.2) You're not alone OP. This phenomenon seems to be the norm rather than the exception. See post/replies below (3-15-2010 ""Shitty departments and unprofessionalism""). (3) You don't like it, then stop applying for jobs. Geez. This is the way it is get over it and yourself. What is the big deal. (4) Wow #3, I can't decide - are you such a douchebag because you're on a SC or because you're not getting any interviews yourself? 5) #3, don't be a dickhead! (6) This happens every time the topic comes up. Somebody vents (on a venting page, no less) about rude SCs. Not cries, just vents about a problem we've all experienced. Then somebody says some version of suck it up and get over it. On some level that's true, but it's a venting page...that's what it's for...venting about stuff we all already know and hate. Then others call the ""suck it up"" guy names and tell him to stop being mean. Bottom line...it's a venting page. It's not a ""brand new information"" page. We know they are rude. We know we have to get over it because it will never change. But that isn't the point. The point is to bitch about stuff we're all going through. If you don't want to read people's bitching, stay off this tab. Problem solved. (7) Good point. (8) The only thing I would add is that academics are not trained in HR, and without proper training, rejecting people is difficult. Rejecting candidates without having interviewed them is easier because less has been invested on both sides. Rejecting interviewees seems fundamentally more painful. I can understand not knowing how to do it well. (This is not an attempt to excuse rudeness - just speculation on why otherwise nice people might come off poorly when in a position that is unfamiliar and uncomfortable.)(90 Number three here, right, IT IS A VENTING PAGE, AND I AM VENTING ABOUT ALL OF THE MEANINGLESS VENTING. (10) Then you should start a new vent instead of using someone else's.  By the way, I think you accidentally turned on your caps lock.  Or was that ""yelling"" supposed to make us feel bad for criticizing you after you told someone to get over himself? (11) I have had INCREDIBLY kind and helpful rejections and also had shitty rejections they sounded like I had applied to work at a fast food joint and scratched my ass during the interview for all their level of courtesy.  They're in the driver seat on this and it's the choice of the SC.  No one expects to get their ass kissed in a rejection but something beyond an e-mail that says ""Thank you for your interest, the position has been filled"" after having interviewed would be nice.  I don't care if I didn't interview - they have hundreds to send out but in this case they had 2.  The place with the helpful and constructive feedback?  They will get my consistent praise.  The other place I'll not have much good to say.  Do they care?  Probably not but for 5 minutes more work by the SCC they could have someone who improves rather than undermines their reputation, probably would have been worth it.","Next/this year I'll re-ask a question I posted earlier. Is it time to create a new job board for next (now quickly becoming this) year? How should we do it? A new file? Or simply a new tab on this one? I vote for a whole new 'file' linked to here: http://academicjobs.wikia.com/wiki/BiologyPositions
(2) another vote for new file! 3) I vote for a new tab 4) New file 5) new tab 6) I vote to just create a new tab on here.7) I vote for a new filed; my concern is that folks might enter 2010-2011 stuff on the 2009-2010 by accident, creating a mess. 8) Good point #7, I too vote for a new file. 9) new file 10) new tab: just move the 2009-10 tab way to the right and label it as such. 9) I added a tab, however, if someone would like to start a new spreadsheet do so and link it to the Wiki page.  :) 10) OP: Thanks for making the tab. We might want to consider migrating to a new file soon, though. This one seems to be a little unwieldy to load right now. It seems these Google docs accumulate bugs after being edited 5 million times. 11) agreed (with 10).  ","internal candidates Is this more common this year or what?  2 interviews this year and both filled by internal candidates.  I know they are not a complete waste of time, but they still take a lot of prep.  One committee did not even have the courtesy to contact my references so I knew something was amiss.  Anyone else experienced this recently?  Very annoying, but I know its part of the process. 1. It happens. IF the school interviewed you and an internal candidate, it is very unlikely you were not given a fair shake.  The thing is that if the internal candidate had performed very well, they are more likely to take the known commodity than bring in the unknown.  IT just happens unfortunately for those who are outsiders.  Being an insider can be a plus, but it can also be a negative in that they know many of your bad points too! 2) Speaking as someone who has been an inside candidate, and who has lost at least one job to an inside candidate, let me assure you that it is not necessarily an advantage. Most search committees take their job very seriously, and try extremely hard to be as fair as possible. To do otherwise would be to develop a reputation that might discourage the best applicants. And even if and inside candidate does get the job, that does not always mean that s/he was the first choice of the search committee. 3.) I heard through the grapevine that I (an outside candidate) was the top pick of the department, but then the dean rejected the department's recommendation and offered it to an internal candidate. Ugh, so frustrating and upsetting. :-( ","Sustainability Science  Are there any Sustainability Scientists here? Anyone know of PhD programs in Sustainability Science? What kind of jobs are you applying to? The Massachusetts College of Art and Design is hiring a visiting lecturer for the fall. Once a week for 3 hours. $3500...not bad. link: http://careers.massart.edu/applicants/Central?quickFind=50826.  The truth is that they just changed the name of an entire field.  Environmental studies and environmental science are sustainability science.  ""they"" change the name of fields all the time.  For example, bioinformatics is hardly any different from biostatistics and computational biology, its all a bunch of whodo. ","postdoc advisor  My postdoc advisor and I have had a great working relationship- until I recently got a job offer. Now they are really making my life hell and simultaneously trying to convince me to not leave because alternately A) I am so amazing if I stay here another year or two or three or six, etc, I will get the most amazing job in the most amazing place; or B) I am so terrible that I will fail miserably without them and then where will I be- no job, no career, a family to support. It's not subtle either, more like ""Who do you think you are kidding"" every day. Every day. I've started working at home to avoid them. It's a good (not great) offer in a not-so-desirable location but it's an R1, the department has lots of good young people, it comes with a very good position for my spouse, and I don't have any big publications so I feel very lucky. When I interviewed, I felt like the people were really cool and I could see myself being happy there.  I'm in a very low supply, high demand field and I know I will be hard to replace and that this portion of my PI's lab will take a heavy hit when I leave. I was planning to keep collaborations going (and as a major portion of my research) after I leave but now those plans are out the window because I couldn't deal with them turning on me again and I have to take some serious time to figure out a new plan which is pretty stressful when I'm trying to set up a research program. I know I am so lucky to get a good job but at the same time I'm getting so much pressure from all sides and I'm not handling it well. Is this normal for leaving a postdoc position and launching your own lab? ","Radford re-opens search??  Anyone have any details on what went wrong now that they are asking folks that they already sent rejection letters if they are still interested. 2) say what??? Where are you getting this intel from? 3) I was wondering the same thing.  Enlighten us.  ;)  Also, has anyone that submitted the additional information heard anything back?  I didn't even get confirmation of them receiving the extra materials (x3).  ***Applied a few weeks after posting and received this message: ""Thank you for your interest in our faculty position in ecology.  We have received over 200 applications for the position, and at this point the search committee has narrowed the field to a short list of candidates who are being considered for interviews.  I will keep your application on file in case we need to broaden the search."" 3a)  #3 again, thanks for the update!  So, I guess if you were not asked for the additional materials, then you were not on the short list?  Sorry #1!  The job market blows even when you are applying at these smaller schools.  I wonder if anyone that has submitted the additional materials has heard anything else.  They said that they planned to move quickly, so I wonder if some of the short folks have made it to the next level yet.  I submitted the extra materials, but haven't heard a peep for weeks. 4) I submitted extra materials about 3 weeks ago, but haven't heard anything since. 5) I also submitted the extra materials at the start of October and never heard back, but talked to a friend of mine today at Radford that said they have started doing phone interviews and that I didn't make the cut (11/8). (6) smaller schools are often mre attractive spots than R1 due to location adn such.  surprisingly, many have comparable teaching loads and resources to an R1.  This was a shock to me when I started looking at them several years ago. 7) #3 here.  Oh well, I guess I didn't make it either if they are already doing phone interviews.  Onward and upward. 8) I emailed the dept. to confirm where things were in the search and received an email on 11/8 that suggested that phone interviews had not occurred.  Interesting....has anyone on the wiki been interviewed?  9) many schools have policies that they cannot say until after the offer is accepted. 10) #4 here: sent additional materials about 1 month ago; on 11/12 I asked for an update and got a reply saying that the interviews are being conducted; so I didn't make the cut... moving on  10) apparently I is being on-site interviewed, so this confirms what is listed above....moving on. 11) Search re-opened??  Didn't someone report that an offer was made and accepted at some point? 12) If it makes you feel better, S Conn said they had over 600 applicants. 13) This post was originally about that fact that there were 200 applicants for this position, but I've changed it to now focus on the fact that the search appears to have been re-opened after an offer was accepted late last year/early this year.  Anyone have any details on what went down? 14) Seriously, so many applicants from the wiki and no one has any details? 15) I know, right.  I was pretty sure there was a Wiki user that was friends with someone there, which is part of the reason we knew how the job was offered and accepted earlier in the year/last last year.  Come on, dude.  Spill the beans! 16) I got my official rejection letter back in Jan. so I knew it had been filled. Is this re-opened because of pay or teaching load?  17)  Well, dude, we just don't know  18)  OK, the new search chair responded to an e-mail from me pretty quickly.  She said the previous search chair was on sabbatical.  She indicated that they had invited ONE candidate for an interview and if he/she works out, they'll make an offer.  If not, they will decide if they have time to interview a second person.  Looks like they picked their favorite from the original list and are hoping their interview goes off without any hitches.  19) LAME, why even bother emailing 30 people and getting their hopes up!","Someone deleted some negative comments (actually the whole position) regarding the finale to a search at University of Arkansas. Funny, and sad. 2) for the aquatic position?  3) damn, I enjoy reading this stuff.  Missed out. 4_ Can some one re-post them? I'm wiriting a book  3) to #4.... laughs! :) 5) Yeah, what the announcement said and what the old boys on the committee wanted were not the same."," Spousal hires 1) I have been on the market for 2 years now, mostly for jobs at SLACs and a few R1/R2 schools. I have learned through the process of turning down jobs that there is a glaring difference between how I had heard/been told/read spousal hires work vs. what i have experienced, and I am starting to realize that SLACs and research schools operate on completely different budgetary principles. So far, I have found out that negotiating for a spouse at a SLAC is much easier if they are in the same department. Outside that, there is little they can do. I feel like before, I had heard that spousal hires were easier if they are outside the department...? Anyway, I am just curious what other peoples' experiences have been at both SLACs and research schools. I am getting the impression that successful spousal negotiations at SLACs require some kind of miracle to happen. 2) There is a little on this topic in the 'illegal questions' converstation on this page. See comment #16 in that section for the experience of me and my spouse. We'd love to tell you how spousal hires work, but we have only been shortlisted and/or had interviews at schools where nobody knows about our spouse, so we worry that they are avoiding the issue before it becomes one. However, I have heard it is better at R1 schools if you would not be in the same department, and we have that going for us (both in the sciences, but different enough). You would think schools would be catching onto the fact that a lot of top people in our field are married to other top people in our field. Thinking long-term, they must know hiring a well qualified dual-career couple has good promise for retention and other mutual benefits. 3) My only experience was an offer last year at a SLAC that I turned down because they would not consider anything beyond an ""adjunct"" position. I put that in quotes because the offer was really just a desk somewhere on campus. There was absolutely no movement or really even any offer to consider something in the future. SLACs definitely are more financially restricted and I understand that. However, this particular school would not even consider some kind of split position, which would have been a bargain for them. My spouse has an equal or better CV, and could have taught several courses they needed filled, so it wasn't a matter of poor fit or qualifications. The saddest part was the dept chair seemed really pissed that I would even ask about spousal hire. Frankly, I don't know of a single instance where a SLAC has accomodated a spousal hire, but it must exist. 4) OP again. I have met ~4 couples through my various interviews this year where one was hired as a trailing spouse while the other was the TT candidate. Both ended up with TT faculty jobs in the department. So... it definitely happens. But, again, that was same discipline. I have not seen it occur for couples not in the same discipline. 5) Yes, but remember your observation is biased by the fact that those couples had to be successful before you could meet them. Thenquestion is, how many couples did you not meet because it didn't work out? Or how many of the other individuals you met actually had a spouse in a different department but it didn't come up because the spouse wasn't there to make the couple obvious? There must be so many factors on the side of the university and the couple to make it work out just right. 6.) Does anyone have experience with spousal hires after a job being accepted? I accepted a position at a R1 last year (my dream job!), but my academic spouse was a year behind me in applying for TT positions and so we did not push for spousal hire. This year he has been offered a R1 position at another university in another state far away from me. He could be in the same department as myself. What could we do at this point and has anyone been in a similar situation? 7) Seems the most straightforward thing would be to have a frank conversation with your department head. They likely won't want to lose you to another R1 who may play ball, and may be willing to work with you as a result. I guess the bottom line is that you have to ask. 8) I know a couple from my grad school who were hired together at a SLAC. Don't lose hope! And secondly, a friend of mine recently got back together with and married the man she'd been with on and off since college. He was already a TT at an R1. They asked at first for spousal hire and were refused. So both started applying elsewhere. They ended up both having offers at schools within an hour of each other across the country (him at another R1, her teaching at a very fancy private school), brought the offers to the department head, and she was rapidly offered a position so they could keep him. Seems like a really great stategy to follow if perhaps for 6. Even if your spouse might not want to actually teach somewhere like a small school or even high school, if you can get an offer like that, it might encourage your university to hire your spouse. 9) the R1 advice I have been getting is ""your spouse doesn't exist until you have the offer"". If you already have a job (or jobs), I think one or both of you getting offers somewhere else (not that that's easy) is your best chance to get your partner in at your school. But if you are both searching, it's once you have the offer but before you sign anything that you have your best chance to work out spousal accomodations. I've heard the advice of bringing it up earlier in the process but that can only help you if your spouse is a bigshot somewhere and you think the school will want them even more than you. Otherwise, mentioning your spouse early in the process will only result in them finding some other reason to choose a different candidate. At least that's what I've seen. 10) I've got a non-science spouse with a TT job at an R1 and I have a 3-year contract position at the same school.  We gave up multiple other offers (including SLAC and R1) to not have a commuter marriage, and in my opinion it's MUCH harder when the spouses are in different departments.  Less incentive to retain, more administrators to involve, etc.  We're hopeful my position will be made TT, but I'm on the market again knowing full well that a competing offer letter and being a 'flight risk' is the only way to really make the university move from the status quo.  Good luck! 11) This is #6 again - #8, how long was the husband at the TT? I've only been at my position for 1 year. Seems like #7's strategy might be a good one! 12) OP again. I have not been successful in securing full-time employment for my spouse, who is very competitive in their own field and currently has a TT position. Have had 3 offers but declined all of them because the schools (all SLACs) were only able to offer her part-time employment (adjunct status). So far, it would seem that it is pretty much a wall when it comes to spousal hires outside the department of hiring at small (and very wealthy) colleges. We were told by faculty outside my hiring department that, ""X college has a very large endowment. If they wanted to make something happen, they would... and they have in the past."" We took that advice to heart and realized we couldn't accept a position that had no hope of full-time/TT development on paper. Words are nice, but it doesn't mean much if they can't commit to something on paper. 13) My sincere sympathy for your situation - it's tough. However, I've always thought a spousal hire is something I'd only break out for a truly outstanding, 1-in-100 kind of professor. At the assisstant prof level, lots of wealthy SLACs can get almost anyone they want to begin with. You might be their first choice, but their 2nd choice probably isn't that much different than you: competition is just too intense. You don't have any leverage, which isn't to say that both of you aren't productive scholars with a great research program, it's just to say they can have their pick of people like you without being ""forced"" to hire someone else. I hope you're able to find a spot that works out well for both of you. 14) OP again. As one of my colleagues put it, they want to hire you, not your spouse. It's a buyer's market and always will be. 15) There's a lot of noise on this post.  Spousal/dual career issues are handled at an adminstrative level. Lots of universities have their policies posted online in fact, just search for them.   If any department is taking on these issues and using them as a criterion for employment, they aren't using the best candidate criterion. If this is the case, then it's a sign of larger problems. 16) I agree with #15. We typically don't know when we offer a job if the candidate is going to try to negotiate a spousal hire (sometimes we have an idea of their plans). Either way, this is apart of the negotiation process that can be solely approved by the administration. Typically, it requires that we petition for a new line (if in the department) or another department petitions for a new line (if they agree). Basically, it can be a mess. In department is much easier because we don't have to depend on another department asking for a new line, as they are not required to do this. But honestly, our administration has never approved a spousal hire at the tenure-track level. In multiple cases I have seen RNTT lines created for spouses. 17) Now that negotiations are coming to an end, how many of you have a position, but you were not able to secure a position for your spouse? What's your next step - postdoc spouse wait for next round, try to get an offer, and use it as leverage at your institution? 18) OP again. I finally obtained a TT job close to our current institution, but my 4 offers had no bearing on what our current institution could offer me (hiring freeze as mandated by the board). Rather than stay and hold out hope for this college to eventually (3, 4, 5, 6 years?) offer me a TT job, I found one close that is a good fit. Now we are looking for houses in between the two universities. Not perfect, but better than sitting in a temporary position and dealing with the unknown. 19) #17 again. Congrats OP! We were not so lucky this year - I have a TT position, but we haven't been able to secure one for my spouse. He'll continue his postdoc this year in another state, so crossing our fingers we can end up in the same place eventually!",rejection hurts:(   2)I feel like we all need that REM song.  :_(,Keep that head up. http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-sheryl-sandberg-commencement-address-transcript-20160514-story.html,"While on the market myself, I am also currently chairing an SC. Just ran some interviews. Man, it's an unfair process. No allowance for nerves - the candidates have to be perfect because a failed search is better than the cost of hiring the wrong person. We can afford not to hire anyone, but we can't afford to get it wrong. And I know I am NOT perfect when I'm on the other side of the interview table - I make all the same mistakes our candidates are making (and so of course, I get rejections, too). 2) At my university it's the opposite - we can't afford to have a failed search because admin will think we can't do the job, so that means we hire anyone, regardless of qualifications. 3) I recently got rejected because the department expected everyone they invited to tick all boxes equally and no one did. 4) That sounds bad. Just like #2. It sounds like nobody knows what they are doing and/or can't agree. 5) Let's all just be honest...much like teaching and advising, getting a PhD in no way qualifies one to evaluate and select a successful colleague and contributer.  The search process overwhelmingly confirms this fact.  x2 6) #5, so what qualifies one to evaluate and select a successful colleague and contributor then? 7) #5 here, I think that is an excellent question.  Of course, having a shared background is going to be critical, but this is not always possible in academically diverse departments.  Relying on publications is about a facile as it gets, but is certainly almost alway the major cut point for any search...but what should we expect, given funding pressures and the general belief that being good at writing papers somehow qualifies one not only for a succesful research career, but somehow also endows you with the ability to you to successfully transmit material to undergrads and grads, while advising them on careers, sometimes, *gasp* outside of academia!  Add to it a general lack of formality in the process and an overwhelming epmhasis in the interview stage on the ever ill-defined ""fit"", and it's all a right mess that needs reform.  I would love to hear how people inside and outside of searches could improve this ridiculous process. x2 8)Hahahaha 9) There is no perfect process that would select the best candidate. The ""best"" candidate is subjective as well. Process is probably stochastic. Once someone is invited to a campus interview, they have the same odds as other candidates. That's when you need to ""endear"" yourself to the current faculty and show them you are a nice person and a good colleague. I remembered a search where one of the candidates disqualified himself by being an asshole during the campus interview. 10) I thought this was about failed searches, not individual candidates failing to endear themselves. 11) Just heard an estimate that the wrong new hire costs an average of $1M, when all is said and done. Salary and overheads and removal costs and startup costs and management and HR time and lost opportunities. 12) What is the estimated cost of a failed search, particularly when you are apparently considering things like ""lost opportunities""? 13) Are we estimating the cost of training applicants that leak out of the pipeline after failed searches too? Some jobs don't come with anywhere near that much startup.14) Smaller startups are usually at smaller places with smaller budgets, so hiring the wrong person could still have a major impact on a department or college 15) Not true outside the US. 16) It doesn't take much to add up to $1M. Say you pay a salary of $100K. With overheads and oncosts, that's a $250K-$300K/year annual cost. If it takes a year to notice a problem, 2 years trying to fix it, and another year to get rid of a poor hire, that's at least $1M spent on salary and oncosts alone. 17) The thread isn't about poor hires, but not being ""perfect"". I see that we have some true believers here though. 18) Yeah, one wonders when a lack of perfection leads to someone so bad that they completely fail to bring in overhead, and lead to 1M in costs over the four years it takes to ""get rid"" of them...19) You laugh but at my institution the provost calculates indirects. ","Instructor Position I've been offered a non-tenure track temorary instructor position. I have two questions for the group a)What tactics have others found to successfully maintain their research/pub record when starting a teaching heavy position (Thankfully I have being giving the course materials), and b) do you recommend not trying to negotiate a salary when the job ad indicates an ""up to X"" amount that is on parr with post docs when this is a temp faculty position? 2) If you want to stay on the research track, maybe a postdoc would be a better route? I would find it difficult to squeeze out enough research while teaching a lot to stay competitive with the eager beavers out there. 3) Don't take the job if what you want in the future is a tenure track research intensive position. You are better off doing another postdoc.  4) Keeping a pub record/research profile while teaching can be a good mechanism to open doors at less research intensive institutions and SLACs (I don't see anywhere in the initial posting about wanting a research intensive position). I'd advise trying to maintain research by maintaining pre-existing collaborations and trying to do some research over summer - depending on the school they might fund undergrad projects (hard to publish but looks good for applying to SLACs showing you mentored students on independent research projects. Also - even if there is a salary cap, you might get some moving expenses (if this is applicable). Good luck.","Sooo.....when does the 2018-2019 job board open?? (insert crying emoticon) 2) You want to get kicked in the teeth already again? jeeeesh 3) If last year was a guide, in about three weeks. Assuming someone takes the trouble to set it up (thanks, Anonymous Potato!) 4) I guess I'd rather look at that than keep revisiting this old one.... I will pass the 100 application mark next job cycle...that is seriously depressing.  5) Ready for those 2018-19 job postings-- ready, set, go! https://tinyurl.com/yaxm7kjl 5) Sigh... now I have to start a new folder on my computer.

I'd like a local field-site scouting trip before I detail my startup so I know what the access issues will be & the costs of available shared resources vs. requesting $ for my own transport. 2) I was asked for mine after my second visit 3) Thank you (#1 here) 4) Was asked after my first visit.,"Here is a link to an google sheet RSS feed creator, so you can get new job information from this sheet without having to read any comments. https://zapier.com/apps/google-sheets/integrations/rss/9543/create-an-rss-feed-from-a-google-sheets-spreadsheet","Campus visit question On a campus visit, Is it worthwhile to mention to the search chair if I recently received another offer? Any chance this could expedite their timeline in giving a response?  2) 100% yes. I was in this exact same position. I was always told to wait until *after* your visit to mention this information. So that way you can ""sell"" them on yourself first. So a few days/week after my interviews I sent an email saying something like "" I just wanted to let you know I've received another offer from X. I really loved your school so would love to know if I am still under consideration there though before making any final decisions."" This definitely helped expediate things in my case and I luckily ended up with competing offers. Good luck!  3) It might not help but can't hurt.  It makes you look desirable, if nothing else.","I don't know if this belongs on the vent tab, but I really don't know where else I can post these thoughts. I am entering my third postdoc, not to explain, but I had a toxic boss and some life tragedies happen so I feel I am already behind when it comes to getting a job. Then, Covid. I'm having trouble even kind of keeping a positive outlook at this point. Information is really scarce, and I am not sure jobs will even exist next year or the next. But what else can I do? Is any one else dealing with existential dread? My research is not something you can do cheaply (genetics/genomics), so I don't know about any future prospects. I don't know, just feeling so hopeless and defeated, but also trapped. I imagine I am among hundreds in this situation, do we all just accept that what we have worked so hard for is unattainable? That's where I am, facing that hard work wasn't enough. Is this a depression post instead of a vent? I guess, but solidarity to those who feel absolutely lost right now. 2) I'm on the same boat. Two TT jobs I was selected for are cancelled now and I don't know what to do (plus my current supervisor is aweful and giving me pressure to show more and more productivity). 3) sorry OP & #2.  Similar situation here. I think a lot of us are feeling this way.  I am hoping that future searches are willing to understand that not everyone can be massively productive 'at home', even if our supervisors seemed confused by this right now. 4) Solidarity #1-3. I have the added wrinkle of my current postdoc ending and the postdoc I had lined up falling through, so am now scrambling to find a new postdoc position at a university that is still allowing hiring 5) In the same boat here - my postdoc ends soon and I don't have anything new lined up - it makes focusing on work at home really difficult when all I can think about is how I can find that next job... 6) Definitely can relate to you all. In my case, I signed an offer letter a couple of weeks before the university shutdowns. But now I'm struggling to get visa/work status figured out on time with all the immigration obstacles that have been imposed in the past month. Now I face the sad reality that I might have to leave the US until visa cases are processing accordingly.. not sure how safe the position is if that happens =// 7) In the same situation but with two young kids at home. In one sense I'm lucky that I have another year of funding, so my short term finances aren't as bad as many people, but I feel like this has doomed any chance of getting the job I've worked toward for 15 years. Makes it very hard to actually care about continuing to do the work that I am supposed to be doing now (even when I can find time to try between the endless child care). Even if I can hold on to funding until jobs come back (in 3 years?) the productivity loss and appearance of a 'too-long' postod will hurt a lot. 8) I'm trying to be proactive and look at industry jobs at this point, though I have 1 year of funding left. I prefer academia, but my family's stability and wellbeing come first. Was already feeling this way due to only getting one interview this job season, but now I'm even more convinced I need to have strong job docs for both tracks. 8) I decided to get out of academia right before Covid and it is amazing. The pay is awesome, the work is great, and the bs and burnout level is low. 9.) OP here: Thank you all, I feel a lot better, I would love at this point to get out of academia, but I'm not sure how marketable my skills are outside of research. I'm looking elsewhere, but I wish everyone luck. 10) I could have written OP's post. 8 years of postdoc, and a verbal offer (last year) that got canceled by a dean. Still have a year left on my grant, but what is the point if there won't be anything to follow up. 11) For OP: many of my friends with genetics/genomics backgrounds have been pleasantly surprised at how marketable their skills were outside of academia.  While any individual non-academic position can still be very competitive, there are just a lot more jobs, the hiriing continues year-round, and the process tends to go a lot faster.  Some Bay Area companies are still hiring (for now) FWIW, if you were looking for a fast exit. 12) @8, hopefully you reread this or anyone else that has input or advice, I'm just curious where/what you ended up leaving academia for? I just graduated with my PhD and am supposed to start my first postdoc in July (still haven't signed anything, although am still told everything is good) but I'm considering all options. Even after I finish this postdoc (if it happens) I'm not sure I want to be in academia given all the negativity I see and hear about finding a job. Money isn't a big factor for me, I just want to settle down and be happy finally. I've lived in 6 different places since high school (an am moving again for this postdoc) and I'm getting really tired of moving around so much. I want a house! A yard! Apartments suck, especially during quarentine. I don't even know where to look for non-academia jobs.  13) Treat it as you would another research project. For me, that involves googling about different industries and companies, setting up a LinkedIn, and contacting friends who have left academia to see how they did it. 14) @12, that really resonates with me. I love academia and the kind of work (research, some teaching) that I get to do in an academic environment, but I'm nearing the end of my postdoc and don't have anything solid lined up, and now it seems the academic market is going to be slow for at least one (but probably more) year. I'm keen on only one more move...mid-30s and unashamedly ready for a house/contributing toward some semblence of retirement/and moving on with a more stable life. I'm really interested in learning more about how to explore non-academic job options (e.g. private industry) with a genomics skillset (thanks @ 13!). How do people go about searching for these jobs? Indeed? I'm not really sure how marketable my skills are, maybe they are more marketable than I think, would be really helpful to hear from someone that's made the leap. 13 again) I was looking at data science jobs, and I even ponied up $$ for an alt-ac consultation from The Professor Is In. The advice boiled down to: making a LinkedIn and make connections with folks who have jobs that are of the type you want, send brief/personalized notes asking for Zoom informational interviews (NOT to ask for a job, just asking how they got their job, what the industry is like, etc), consider some of the bootcamp/fellowships such as Insight Data Science, provide link on resume to coding projects/examples. Networking is very important, because some jobs are open for referral before ever being posted, so the chances of getting a job from an online application portal can be low. Apparently that's one reason cold-messaging people on LinkedIn can be viable, because there's the prospect of finder's fees. The hiring process in industry is also much faster than in academia. There's also plenty of advice online about writing resumes/cover letters and how to interview. I found the hardest part to be boiling down my CV into a resume. Once I only include the relevant work experience (so not any teaching or outreach), I was down to a pretty thin 1-pager. On the plus side, I've applied to 4 jobs since late April (all somewhat related to my field of ecology), and have had 1 phone interview. So a better track record than my academic job applications, and much faster results too! 14 again) thanks for sharing what you've learned @13, that is super helpful. good luck on your job search! 2) here: One of the two cancelled TT jobs I was interviewed for is resumed now and they contacted me (YES, around two months after they sent the cancelation information) if I'm still interested. Kinda surprised! We all should be OK soon. Just hang in there! 15) Glad to hear your good news but higher ed is not going to be ok. 16) It wasn't OK before COVID x5. I know # of higher ed jobs are way more than number of graduates and COVID made it worse only. But, we have to nail it down and we will. ","finding jobs I'm new to applying for ecologist jobs and curious if y'all use resources other than this board to find jobs? That is, how complete is it? I'm subscribed to EvolDir faculty jobs and that's it. I just added two European jobs that were missing and had been on EvolDir, so it seems like other searching is needed and I wonder where to look. 2) I think a range of strategies can be useful. I searched directly on the jobs wesbites for a small list of universities/colleges that were on my ""high priority"" list, occassionally looked at scince, nature, higheredjobs, etc, and followed this site.  Most of the time, the jobs were already on this site by the time I found them elsewhere, but sometimes not.  It can also be useful to form a small group of friends within your specialty to exchange resources/posts."
"OSU and UC Who's excited about the OSU and UC openings? I am! (1) I'm never one to get too excited about accumulating more rejections. So who is UC?

Thus, leaving me in prime position for next year (but even that scenario is optimistic). (6) to #1 & #5, I've reached the same state!  (7) I applied to the OSU job and was amazed, and thrilled, that there still are zoologist departments. I would love to be in that department and as an evolutionary ecologist with an emphasis on behaviour think I'd fit in well. Unfortunately I'm guessing there are close to 100 applicants and I too doubt my record is strong enough to land me even a phone interview. Given that I know one other applicant to the position, I'm pretty sure my 9 pubs isn't going to cut it. (8) I applied too and I have 10 pubs. Does that mean I automatically have a better chance than you? I really think it's more than just number of publications. (9) I can't speak to this particular search - but I've been so often told that the ""number and quality"" of publications (not all publications are made equal) is the single biggest factor in getting an interview at a research university that I have to believe it.  Clearly, though, being the ""single biggest factor"" still means that many other factors are also considered.  By the way, I also think that 9 or 10 articles in good journals is a very competitive number of publications. (10) Wow rereading my previous post (7) I'm horrified that my grammar was so bad. Don't know what my problem was going to be. I certainly recognize that it isn't just a numbers issue but I know from SCs at my university that number does often matter as a first cut.","University of New Haven Has anyone heard anything at all about the position?

My spouse thought we will be moving to the 2nd postdoc position for sure, but I try to tell my spouse I may have other options.

I'd like to find a permanent job and we don't need to move around again and again....  1) You can't make them happy...you just hope something decent comes along before they get fed up waiting for the actual job. Not mention having to put up with my stress of applying, waiting, interviews, waiting and rejection. Also, this isn't exactly low pressure job as I am working my tail off to get publications out in the hopes that I might land something - so it doesn't leave much time for stress-free couple/family time. At least we make a ton of cash as postdocs. My wife feels the same as your husband and I can't blame her. She feels a bit powerless. So we are expanding our options this year and we will start looking for nonacademic jobs and try to stop moving (she is not an academic). We also have kids in school so we need to stop the BS of waiting like this. Being a postdoc can be stressful -- almost as stressful as being the spouse of a postdoc.  2) at some point it becomes impossible.  10 years of moving around chasing jobs has my spouse on her last straw. 3) I don't mention job possibilities or even application sometimes until I have an interview.

OF course, many have been taken down after filling that do not show up in that number, and certainly, many of those are no longer open.  Compare 4,362 to the number of academic positions (721) that have been posted on this wiki.  I have to say that there must be way more opportunities in environmental consulting, and most of us are qualified to do it. 2) More like over-qualified. Most consulting companies hire people with BS degrees, and are not interested in PhD's who they have to pay more. 3) Actually, I think it's more like they're looking for people who can do things like Phase-1 EIS statements out of the box. I know ecologists get frustrated with this, but the fact is they're not interested in people that know about community ecology theory or whatever, just people that can crank the jobs out for them.

I have been told on a couple of interviews now that my research, while interesting, just ins't ""quantitative enough"" for what they are looking for. I find this trend quite depressing as the reason I selected the horrow show that is an ecology career is partly to be outside and in the field, and I think I am a pretty bang up field ecologist. It is just a shame that we appear to be continuing a movement away from traditional field ecology (and taxonomy!) in constant favor of ""mathy"" or ""omics"" approaches. Is the obsession with math really advancing the field of ecology in substantial ways?; honestly, I am asking. 2) For what it's worth, I think there are some signs that the pendulum might soon swing back to favour natural history/field ecology.. see new section of ESA journal Frontiers Ecol Enviro's natural history notes, etc. Trying to be positive? 3) I personally think that improving quantitative skills is a good trend and has improved ecology. But even if you disagree, it's hard to argue with the logic of such hires: somebody with strong quantitative/omics skills can be a valuable collaborator to a large number of faculty studying different topics, and a mentor to their students. The flip side (in terms of finding a job) is that there is a large pool of people who can call themselves 'quantitative ecologists' precisely because the skills are broad and transferable. 4) Full disclosure I consider myself a quantitative ecologist--but I think it is good for the field becuase it's helping solve problems, especially at large spatiotemporal scales, that really weren't possible before. But as a field we need balance, and most of my best work is in collaboration with people who really know the ins and outs of their systems from extensive field research. I am sorry that the perception that you're not ""quantitative enough"" has affected your job search. 5) EO Wilson may have similar thoughts http://on.wsj.com/2hxBoM3 6) I too consider myself a quantitative ecologist and think that more rigourous methods can help answer questions that are not possible to answer with experimental methods (just as #4 says). But, I'm not just seeing a move towards quantitative ecologists; I am seeing ecology departments specifically seeking physicists and/or mathematicians to answer ecological questions (see the UC Santa Barbara search this year, though it's for a Systems Biologists, so maybe a slightly different thing). 7) I also consider myself quantitative and my only problem with this trend is that there is always someone 'more quantitative' than you out there. Quantitative methods are ultimately techniques, and I would hope we are not using techniques to chase questions+problems. I would advocate for broadly training students to be quality ecologists with modern quanitative skill sets. However, I admit I think I gain an edge because I can be flashy with statistics, and models and draw upon elements from basic physics. 8) There might always be someone more quantitative than you, but take heart: at some point, they aren't really ecologists any more. (That's me: I'm an ecological modeller rather than a quantitative ecologist. It doesn't stop me from applying for those ""quant ecology"" jobs, but no luck so far). 9) No kidding! I recently attended a major international ecology conference and quantitative techniques were widespread from community ecology to agricultural ecology to fisheries, taxonomy in particular is being greatly neglected and we will come to a stage when taxonomic experts will no longer exist. Its quite probable that in the near future ecology and evolution will be led by mathmaticians running models on species they have no idea about! 10) In an environment in which there's a lot of competition for TT jobs, I think that pretty much everybody thinks (falsely) that what ""every place"" is looking for is ""something other than what I do"". I mean, I just searched now (12/30/2016), and only about 19 TT jobs out of ~426 on this year's listing are for ""quantitative"" ecology or evolution, as judged by the subject area and description (counting theory positions as ""quantitative"", and counting systems biology as ""ecology or evolution""). That's not too different from the 14 ""wildlife"" jobs or the 16 or so ""fish"" jobs, and way less than the 45 or so ""plant"" jobs.  x2 11) OK but how many wildlife fish or plant jobs will elect to ultimately hire someone heavy on quant? Huge emphasis in all 3 of those fields on pop models, so I'd wager many. This also aligns with my personal knowledge of other post doc friends and colleagues getting TT jobs or research scientist positions. All very heavy in quant. 12) Math is fun. (x \infty -infinity)","Naming names Someone is posting the names of people in the notes section and making them protected cells. I don't think that's appropriate, particularly as it's evident that a single person is putting other people's names there. Can this be changed? x2 2) I get why people are upset, and my knee jerk reaction was also anger that the process has been made less anonymous, without consent of the applicants. However, U of M has made the process fairly transparent with the addition of new hire faculty profiles on their website, along with their negotiated start-dates. I'm really not sure how I feel about this situation. At this point, is it really any different than saying person X works at place Y? Congrats to the new hires. It looks like U of M hired some good young faculty.  4) It wasn't only at Michigan - others were posted, but I deleted the names.  5) If it's been publicly posted (on twitter, department news, etc.), what's the objection? 6) If it's publicly posted, there's no need to post it here under the guise of anonymity.  This anonymous setup gets abused, and there have been some cases of clearly misrepresenting the facts, like lying about people turning down jobs.  People have also been ""outing"" interviewing candidates or suspected ""inside candidates"" here, which is even worse. If you really want to know who got a job somewhere, check the department's website. There's a downside to letting people anonymously post who is getting what kind of interviews here. Even if it's been announced on the website, putting names here encourages the practice. Respect other people's decision whether, when, and where to announce this information - taking it out of their control is not the point of this board. 7) It is very disappointing that this jobs wiki is being vandalised with false information and ""outing"" people and presumably by someone who is probably aspiring to become a faculty member and mentor other people. Shame. 8) Based on the jobs that were ""outed"" my guess is that someone got most of the info from Twitter. 9) These aren't interview lists or inside candidates, they're people whose acceptance of the position has been broadcast across the internet already.  Is that really a problem?  @6 Job ads are also publicly posted, so I guess we shouldn't collect them here? 6) The obvious difference is that universities want everyone to know they have an open position, while job candidates may wish to remain confidential. Many universities take pains to avoid mentioning names when advertsing the seminars. Again, this has to do with respecting other people's rights to their own information. You don't know a candidate's motivation or what is best for them, so respect their right to be in control of that. And problems come, as this wiki has demonstrated in recent days, with the fact that anonymous forums are terribly unreliable sources for information like this. Whether it's someone trying to twist other candidates or just yank people's chains, there's a decent amount of misinformation here. That can hurt people - and what's the upside? If it's been posted on a university website, go there and get it straight from the university. If you want to say an offer has been accepted, link to the university's website. 9) I agree we shouldn't post ""candidates"" for the reasons you suggest, but once someone has accepted and this has been announced to the world - what's wrong with that? The upside is so other folks can see what it takes to get a job at univeristy X and to spread the good news for the one who got it. I'm curious what the general consensus is on this. 10) If it's been announced, post a link. Posting someone's name, with no supporting public documentation, and then locking the cell to prevent editing would get you booted of wikipedia faster than your head could spin. Wikipedia-style ethics should be a minimum here.  11) Let the person announce their news to the world.  It's their job, should be their choice when and how to tell everyone.  I think this is a major foul move. 9) Would ""Hired candidate announced at https://twitter.com/duffy_ma/status/860118611511439360"" be better?  10) Wow, who cares?  If the offer has been accepted then there is no reason to worry about hiding that.  The world will know soon enough.  I'm surprised so many of you are worried about this, don't you have enough to worry about with your own life?  :) 11) I'm concerned because a) taking over someone else's information is not your job, nor is it the point of this, and b) people are listing candidates, which universities won't even do, and recklessly speculating about which inside candidate has some perceived unfair advantage over them. I think posting a link to a person's twitter account or a university's announcement is great - it's also the only way to reliably conclude that the information is correct. Sticking with anonymous outing harms everyone because you get false information. 12) I agree, citing a source for news on who was hired is better.","I'm feeling salty about a recent twitter thread of an asst prof who's claiming to work 45 hr/week--much less without meetings, etc. I'm killing myself between grant apps, occasional job apps, teaching, papers, etc, and don't want to count my hrs/week. Does this actually reflect a real asst prof work load? 2) Social networks are filled with bragging people. Someone who really works that much would not have the time and the mind to post on twitter. I have colleagues who continuously post on twitter how much they work, how much overwhelmed are. If so, they wouldn't have the time to post on twitter.Another ridicoulus thing is pretending to be happy for their students' achievements when clearly they are showing off their mentorship qualities. Twitter is just a bunch of: look at me! 3) I agree Twitter = #ScienceBragging, and some are just looking out for themselves but some people are genuinely proud of their students and try to get them maximum exposure. 4) I use twitter, I don't brag and I'm not accomplished, lol, that being said, I like twitter a lot. I do get annoyed every now and then due to braggers but I love finding out first about papers that just got published, updates on conferences, and I very strongly disagree with #2.. you can work and use twitter, it's ridiculous that you think you can't do both. My PhD advisor is incredibly active in twitter and she's also an extremely successful women in science. 5) Maybe I'm off base here, but the OP sounded to me like they thought 45 hours was way too little - it sounded like they thought they worked much more than that. It doesn't seem like bragging to me, actually. I agree there is a culture of bragging (on twitter and elsewhere) about how much you work - I've heard lots of stories about asst profs who work 50, 60, 70 hours a week. But I think 45 is actually pretty realistic for an average (some weeks may be much more if grants are due). I do think there is a tendency to exagerate how much we work, but I also think (for me, at least) I don't actually work every hour that I'm at work. I get lost down an internet hole, or I take time during the standard work day to do non-work things, because my job is awesomely flexible. I do have to say that my work hours became more predictable, more efficient, and lower (probably in the 45/week range rather than 60/week) once I had a kid.  6) So, I may be the odd woman out here, but I think a REAL 45 hour week is probably doable. If I was honest, I probably work about 45 hours a week. But the hours I spend 'working' are 60+ and they feel LONG. They are just not all terribly productive hours because Im not great at time managment and Im easily distrated. My PhD advisor definitely worked 45 hour weeks from Ast. Prof to Full Prof and has been very successful. 7) Depends on what you consider work and the type of university that employs you. To be honest, at a lot of universities (excluding R1s) you can get by doing much lower than 40 hrs of work a week. My tenure requirements were 2 peer-reviewed pubs (author position did not matter), 1 grant submission, average teaching evals, and some departmental level service. Over a 5-6 year period, that does not require close to 40 hrs a week. Granted, b/c I enjoy research and service, I easily hit 40+ hrs a week. I don't really consider that working b/c it wasn't necessary for promotion at my current job. I do it b/c I like it and b/c I would like a better job. 8) That's exactly me, #6. You're not alone. x2",used equipment What do people think about accepting used/surplus equipment from the department as a way to lower the startup request? 2) I would want to be able to inspect it for condition first-- and maybe you could negotiate official maintenance/tune-up of said equipment to make sure it will meet your needs,"Nothing has explained my life more than this article: https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/annehelenpetersen/millennials-burnout-generation-debt-work 2)yea...""That realization recast my recent struggles: Why can’t I get this mundane stuff done? Because I’m burned out. Why am I burned out? Because I’ve internalized the idea that I should be working all the time. Why have I internalized that idea? Because everything and everyone in my life has reinforced it — explicitly and implicitly — since I was young. Life has always been hard, but many millennials are unequipped to deal with the particular ways in which it’s become hard for us."" 3) The only burnout I'm experiencing is from reading so many navel-gazing articles about millenials. 4) Thanks for posting 5) @3 agree that obsessing over the problem contributes to the burnout. But don't be so dismissive, this is a real and serious psychological challenge that is diminishing the motivation of a huge swath of the next generation of scientists and other people who want to make a positive contribution to society. I actually think that the more you care the worse the burnout gets, and we should all be glad there are so many young people out there who care. And the younger you are the more daunting the problems ahead: The world has changed dramatically and quickly and the Boomer lens of reality is no longer accurate.","Second visit reimbursement woes Recently offered a TT position at an R1 University. I requested a second on-site visit for my spouse and I, to which they agreed. They are running on a short timeline, so asked that I come in <2 weeks. I agree, and booked the airfare, and it was very costly! But hey they wanted us there. I submitted my receipts for reimbursement and was told that they will reimburse my airfare immediately. However, as per University policy, they will only reimburse my spouse’s travel as a part of relocation costs, pending my acceptance of the offer. I am rather turned off by this, considering this imposed a $900 financial burden on us that we will have to deal with until I accept (ticket is non-refundable). Even then, this has eroded our relocation (which is likely low and will have to come out of our pocket later). Furthermore, if I choose not to accept, they wont reimburse her and this burden was imposed on me without me fully knowing what their policies were. If it were me, I would have pushed off the second trip a few weeks and gotten cheaper tickets, but the chair wanted to expedite it. I responded to the Departmental administrative assistant and said I was displeased with this financial burden that we have to deal with. But all I received was an apology and “this is how most Universities are”...which is fine (not my University btw), but I wasn’t made aware of this and could have tried to mitigate the personal expense. It leaves me wondering, what else is this Uni going to cheap out on, or screw me over financially with?? I should also add that we have reservations about the location of the Uni (we never envisioned moving to this region) because it is will limit our access to recreational activities and family, so this visit was absolutely necessary. The second visit is coming up and hasnt happened yet. How would you feel about this? 2) this is a red flag to me!  3) my 2nd visit was a bit screwed up (not as screwed up as the above, but they required I sign my letter before 2nd visit and would only partially reimburse my wife's ticket to come see the place).  This screw up was 50% the then fuddy duddy chair not knowing how the world works, and 50% the penny-pinching dean (this was in 2012 with the aftereffects of the financial crisis still in the air).  6 years later, I just got tenure, I love my job & university, the chair retired long ago and that dean's term ended 3 years ago as well.  I wouldn't consider this a red flag, and it does suck but I would suck it up and brush this off, water under the bridge. 4) Tremendously frustrating and unfair, for sure, but if this is a place you and your wife will like, don't let that stop you. Try to think as long-term as you can on this one.   5) It kinda sucks, but deal with it.  It is not a red flag. The Chair almost certainly was not aware of this particular reimbursement policy (they don't know every obscure policy), and the HR person handling the funding is just following the rules, so it's really no one's fault.  Your best option is probably to see if the Chair can reimburse you from departmental discretionary funds, if it was an actual written ""promise"" he/she made, but ultimately it may be best just to let it slide, esp. if you plan on taking the offer.  $900 is not a lot of money in the grand scheme of things. 6) Agree with 5, this does not seem like a red flag to me, especially since you are the one who initiated the idea for the second campus visit. I am not at all surprised that the university is unwilling to pay for your spouses travel. Especially if they are willing to eventually reimburse you via relocation costs, I don't see anything all that wrong with this. x3 7) My university wouldn't have reimbursed you for any of the second trip. Not saying it's right...just saying.  8) We have way more red tape on campus visit and moving expenses.   Try to find a work around but don't be surprised to run into issues. 9) My R1 flew my whole family out to recruit us. Rented us a car, etc. No receipts, they booked and paid for everything. x2 10) Awesome number 9!!!!!!!!! Can you create more R1 universities for us all? 10) I'm #9 here...and I'm the guy that my department is now screwing 2 years later. So, nothing stays perfect....(we may not be an R1 next year anyways)","Had 2 campus interviews back to back in January & February. The latter told me by email that ""an offer is in works"", but nothing after that (been more than 2 weeks after that email). The first institution just called me last week to extend an offer for a TT position, however, the salary is more than 20% less than my current salary. Not sure if they're low-balling me or, because it's a small teaching school the new hire salary is this low. Any thoughts? How to negotiate salary when the difference is this much?  2) Are you currently a postdoc? 3) I would guess the coronavirus situation has taken priority over everything else. But two weeks is still long. Asking for an update is OK. With the other place, it is perfectly acceptable to tell them your current salary and ask if they can match it (and see how close they can get). Some places have flexibility. Others do not. 4)  2 weeks is long, but everything is probably in chaos right now - you could nicely write to follow up and say you understand there are likely delays because of coronavirus etc 5) I would say that 2 weeks is completely expected -- it often takes over a month for all the negotiations to complete for a TT job, and can be longer if people are considering multiple offers. With COVID-19, it could be much longer unfortunately.  But it's definitely ok to ask for an update, and I would recommend it -- it's good to show your continued interest. 6) #1, OP here again. Yes, currently I'm a postdoc, but does that mean that offering more than 20% less salary is appropriate? I did reveal my current postdoc salary, but they said they can't match it. For the other school, I'm planning to ask them if they'll eventually offer me the position given they might be late due to this corona virus epidemic situation. But overall, my question is whether or not it's wise to take a paycut just because I'm a postdoc, and the offered position is a TT faculty position? 7) For financial reasons on my end, I would not take that deal. But, it's up to you as to whether you can make that work with respect to the cost of living in that location 8) At smaller schools, they often can't match it because they don't have enough funding to pay faculty well. That money is needed to give the incoming administrators a 25% raise over the person they're replacing. All cynicism aside, the department would probably love to pay all of their faculty well, but a 20% bump is just something that you typically can't negotiate. Maybe a couple thousand more, but many smaller schools just have faculty that are poorly paid. 9) In my humble opinion, if you're getitng paid a typical postdoctoral salary (NIH payscale) and being offered 20% less than that, that is not a long term sustainable wage pretty much anywhere in the country. I don't think it's worth it. 10) Yeah, there are scales of schools. A lot of people here have no idea what is normal or possible at small schools and so dismiss them out of hand, but I can confidently say if they're offering you 20% less than NSF/NIH postdoc payscale, it's not gonna be a fun or productive place to work. 11) Salary considerations are important, but to suggest they correlate with the quality of your colleagues or your productivity (however defined) is misleading. 12) OP here again. Thanks all for the feedback. I just compared my current postdoc salary with the NIH payscale & my current postdoc salary is about 20% higher than the NIH payscale for postdoc - just to give you some perspectives. The geographical location has lower living cost compared to my current living area though. 13) Then I would say the salary is tight, but doable, especially if you love the place. 14) I just turned down a TT position because it offered $5k less than what I make now as a postdoc.... in my current situation my partner just got a raise, makes more than me in a permanent position. I also have time in my postdoc still... not to mention the other places I have interviewed had starting salaries $20k+ more than I make now....so I opted to say no because I wasn't willing to settle. The faculty were great, but the location was not ideal and there was no way that we could survive on my salary alone had we moved. Moral of the story is you have to do what is best for you and sometimes that means turning down a TT position... you are worth getting paid well. We have all put in so much work we deserve to get paid more than our postdoc and it is sad that a lot of instituitons/states dont' think that is true. 15) 100% agree with you 14), I think holding out can often be the right move. 15) OP here again. I did receive the second offer 2 weeks ago, and during the negotiation they rescinded the offer for requesting a higher salary (abruptly, without any conversation)!! I will update you here with a new thread what happened, because I think this is important thing people should know. 16) Is this perchance related to the one job labled ""offer rescinded"" on the main page?  Just trying to gauge how common offers being rescinded is right now. 17) No, mine is not listed on the main page (OP here). I'm just not sure if I should ""out"" the school. 18) Wow, that's awful and ugly. Would like to know more when/if you're ready to share. 19) That is terrible. I am so sorry that happened to you and shame on that school. Asking for a higher salary is virtually expected in negotiations.","H-1B visa stop affecting academic jobs I recently got a TT Assistant Professor position and my H-1B visa is being processed (I am European). Well, there is a receipt from USCIS saying that the got the payment. I read that scholars and professors may be exempted from the new immigration stupid move. However, somewhere else I read that that exception is for J visas only, so I assume that anyone in a similar situation to mine is royally screwed, right? 2) (Not an attorney, but in a similar boat) - From what I understand, if you are IN the USA on a different visa, then your H1B can be processsed. If you are in Europe, you're subject to the ban - unless you already have a stamped visa in your passport. Check with your immigration folks! You may be abailable to qualify for an exemption. The specific ""scholar and professors"" phrasing related to J-1 visas. 3) I am also in the process of being hired for a TT Assistant Professor position which would require that my current H1B be transfered to the new institution. I don't know how this will affect us, foreign scholars, but I will have a meeting with a lawyer next week and expeculate about this, I can give an update here when I do that. I cannot tell you how much this has stressed me out in just one day! X2. 4)@3  Not a lawyer, but based on an email just sent out by my institution's international office - it seems that your transfer will likely be approved. It really sounds like this stupidity is targeted toward those new H-1B applicants who are not already in country."
"feeding the fam Just curious, how many of you are married? married with kids? kids? Being jobless is tough with a family to feed.  (just change the N) Married N= 19
Living together=3 Living apart=2 
Married with kids N= 31

Just kids (single parent) N= 0 

Single N= 33

1) Have furry kids. I also get tired of people telling me I just have to be prepared to go anywhere - it is not just me I have to think about! And I have to think about my spouse's job too (don't worry, not looking for a spousal hire). (2) I'm in the same boat - have to think about my spouse's job and also quality of schools for our kids. I know some folks get annoyed that those of us who are married feel more constrained, so I thought I'd point out another potential very real factor for any of us (married or not) - distance from older family members whose care will be/is our responsibility. (3) I admit that being single seems to give me greater flexibility in terms of relocation, however, you married folks and those in steady relationships can get much needed support from your significant other, which can be helpful during a time like this. Also, it should give you better chance of backup financial plans when one of you (the academic) is out of a job for a while. Being single, when I'm unemployed, I'm unemployed. (4) Ah, but sometimes your spouse is unemployed (or underemployed) because you moved somewhere to get a post-doc in order to be competitive for a ""real"" job - and then both end up stuck somewhere with no (or less than idea) jobs. Then there is a household to support. But, honestly, lack of job just really stinks for us all - agreed? 5) OP, I added a single category above. Hope you don't mind. : ) (5) It is often financially impossible to move away for a low-paying post-doc. Another issue is the cost of daycare. I just can't be that productive while also taking care of 2 young kids at home. AND, there are very few households today that can make it on just one income. (6) To #5 - completely agree. I got so much crap for worrying about a job for my spouse at post-doc locations (and moving a household for a (very) low-paying post-doc was painful). We lucked out - he got a dream job and I got a low paying but fantastic post-doc. But will have to figure it out again for either another (low paying) post doc or ""real"" job. Reality is I don't think we can afford to move for another post doc. (7) Moved my family for this post-doc. My child is in full-time daycare, my husband is finding work where he can. Will not move for another post-doc. Its faculty position or non-academia for me. (8) OP, I added a ""living apart"" category as well. Hope you don't mind.","Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute  Anyone know what the scoop on the latest round of queries is? I thought the position was offered and filled. I already received a rejection letter but now I'm being asked if I'm still interested? Seems a little odd... My rejection letter said they were negotiating with a candidate. But it also said they were going to be hiring again next year, and they would know in June. Either negotiations fell through with this first candidate, or they're getting an early jump on next season. ","Search committee has COI with candidates chosen for interviews it seems that this Univ has the tendency to be biased in their selection of candidates for interviews and beyond. At least one of the candidates is a collaborator of one of the search committee members and they push for this candidate both for an interview and beyond. Seems quite unfair but glad that the entire departmental faculty vote. There is no way to nail this but having seen this in three searches seems to often to pass of as coincidental. This may not seem to the job candidates, but remember, the point of the job search is to find the best person for the job.  Collaborators often fit that description very well.  A ""bias"" toward a known quantity is perfectly legitimate.  I'm not saying that people should just hire their friends, but what's wrong with advancing the candidacy of someone you already know as a professional? (1) Bottom line is that it is stupid to think scientists are objective. They are pretty highly ""cronyistic"" or academically nepotistic but think they are objective and claim that what they are doing is 'legitimate'. But most of the time if they recognize the name or the lab of origin, then the candidate is placed above and beyond the rest who appear relatively unfamiliar. Obviously collaborators WILL fit the description well, why else would they be collaborators? If the SC is supposed to fill the department with those doing things that are similar to what they are involved in, then recruiting and promoting porfessional collaborators is a great mechanism. However, for a healthy department profile, it would be wiser to keep the options open and not bias toward professional collaborators. May be then granting agencies have missed the point with their policies on COI. How else can one ""advance"" those already known through professional collaborations?","Best job talk(s)? Please share (in just a few sentences) what made the best job talk (and/or seminar) you've ever seen so impressive (i.e., what made it stand out).  In doing so perhaps we can all learn a thing or two about improving our own.  Thanks! I can tell you what didn't come off as a good job talk - more than 15 min of colorful slides to explain a simple concept and coming back to those slides throughout the talk without any significant data made this talk very poor, descriptive at best. So, many pubs (several of which the speaker was first author) but no grasp of the research leading to those pubs gave a very poor impression about this fairly recent Phd from a really high profile research group. And finally, going over time with less than 5 mins for questions, is not considered good. When one says 1 hour seminar - it is very well understood that the allocaiton should be something like 45min talk + 15 min discussion. A little over, such as, 50 min talk and 10 min discussion, is fine but barely enough time for discussion comes off like the speaker doesnt care about comments/questions <---- Depends on what the search committee wants out of the talk. I have had many where they tell you to gear the talk toward undergrads (M/L and below universities). If that's the case, a lecture approach to certain topics is desired, even if it means spending an inordinate amount of time explaining basic concepts. This is obviously not desired at any R1 university job seminar that I have heard of. ---> (1) here: I agree with what you're saying. However, when one is called for an interview, it is obvious whether it is an R1 univ or not. If not then some more research on that is called for. And almost always it is not all about what the ""search committee wants"" because all the faculty in the department vote on the acceptability and rank the interviewees. Also, it may be helpful to ask whether or not the seminar should be geared toward undergrads. Even if there were UGs in the audience, in my opinion, just a bunch of pretty pictures is not going to go down well in the seminar or in a freshman class.  2) Actual OP here: I guess I was hoping people might comment on my query as posted in the cell to the left.  I've seen lots of jobs talks over the years and given perhaps a dozen of my own.  I've seen plenty of bad talks (and probably delivered a few myself).  I'm mostly interested in what made your absolute fav talk stand out so much.  Thanks. 3) Interaction with audience...especially students (coming from a current M/L search committee member).","interview feedback I got rejected from one campus interview. The feedback was that I was too confident... and didn't talk about teaching enough. Their teaching load was 4/4 which is a lot (counted labs). So should I express more interest in teaching for my next interview (probably a half half on teaching and research)? how to show my interest in teaching more? show them my syllabus, quizs and exams developed, evaluation forms generated? 1) sounds like you should count your blessings and didn't get the offer.  Some people don't like confident people because they wont' be able to manipulate you.  You probably avoided a hellhole, especially with a 4/4 teaching load.  Though if you want that kind of job and you do some research ahead of time (or glean info from a phone interview), you can guess the type of department it will be and modify your statements accordingly.  If there is a high teaching load, then don't talk about your glamor research and pubs. (2) agreed - probably dodged a bullet. i would definitely look at people's websites and see what they emphasize. talk about pedagogy and teaching strategies as your #1 focus, research as secondary (and as primarily supporting your teaching and providing students with opportunities). if a 4/4 is the type of place you want to be, it would be worth talking to the chair to get more feedback, most are willing to provide that type of feedback. (3) a 4/4 is a lot and this may not have been the best place to work. That being said, I would at least consider their advice. I obviously have no idea what the actual interview was like but being ""too confident"" is code for arrogant. I know that at a lot of SLAC and MS schools, candidates come in from an R1 and act a bit superior. The candidates seem to have no clue that their job duties and expectations will change dramatically from that of an R1 postdoc. This would especially be the case if you walked into a place that had a 4/4 load and spent most of your time talking about research. That is showing a level of cluelessness that would annoy me if I was on the search committee. Again, I have no idea of what the interview or place was like and they may have been total jerks...but to answer your questions as to whether you should you express more interest for teaching if interviewing at a place that has a 4/4 (or close to it)...well - yeah. In fact, I would think it would be close 80/20 in time spent talking about teaching/research. It does sound like this was not a good fit for either party.  (4) Agree with commenter 3, 'too confident' is a nice way of saying arrogant.  I have seen this happen at SLAC and MS schools.  The candidate acts like the school would be lucky to have them.  Arrogance + only talking about research at one of these schools also demonstrates a lack of institutional awareness.  In response to the earlier comments (also arrogant), high teaching loads don't necessarily indicate a hellhole, just a different kind of institution than the one you are accustomed too.  It's a big academic world out there, so lose the R1 superiority complex.  Plenty of PhDs view chasing trivial publications and scrabbeling for ever-dwindling grant money as hellish. 5) OP here. Thank you so much for all of your comments. I pretty much guessed that they may be saying I'm arrogant. But I totally don't feel that way. I respect the campus and every faculty very much. This is my first interview ever, so it is good to learn that I should shed off my R1 sterotype, and be more realistic on the SLAC or MS school type of work. I will remember to talk about teaching/research as 80/20 ratio then. Should I show them my syllabi, and teaching material? 6) #3 here...nobody on this forum can know whether you were arrogant or the school was truly off in some way. I think that you need to show them through your conversations that you spend a lot of time thinking about how to be a good teacher and that you recognize that your research productivity will come in second to teaching. You need to show that you are excited about teaching. I wouldn't necessarily break out the syllabus but have it ready in case they ask. Simply showing quizzes, exams, evaluations etc...without being prompted will seemed forced. I am still learning how to do this myself. In my first couple interviews, I just wanted to talk about my research as I had spent so much time on it. It was simple to have that conversation. It wasn't until after teaching a few classes and screwing up interviews that I am now comfortable in talking mostly about teaching. Maybe the most important thing is to recognize that interviews are tough and the first one usually sucks. Congrats on getting one! 7) Hey OP, first of all, kudos for trying to be constructive and learn something from this process.  That's a great attitude for just having gotten some bad news and it'll pay off in the long run.  Yes, ""overconfidence"" can be code for arrogance, but also keep in mind that all of these job searches are insanely competitive.  Sometimes the smallest thing will be the difference between the top candidate and #4.  So think about what you can improve, but also keep in mind that sometimes committees have to look *really hard* for reasons not to hire people.  So take the overconfidence comment with a grain of salt.  It may have been the only thing they could find to rule you out.   (8) I agree with this last statement: a chair explained to me that I did not get an offer cause my personality ""had edges"" (and I have NO IDEA what that means...chair said she and others really liked me but others felt like conversation didn't flow well enough and I was a bit too formal. this info i used to make my next interview go much more smoothly). She basically said it wasn't that they woudn't have been happy to hire me, but that with the huge amount of competition, that's the type of thing they use to sort people apart.  (9) if its a teaching slave yard, just spout how teaching is so wonderful and you could not live antoher day without the opportunity to enlighten students into the wwonders of your field.  If its anything else, balance your comments between teaching and research.  ","136 job seekers were kind enough to fill out my survey on your job search in 2013-2014.  
A more thorough analysis will be hopefully published in consort with other data about jobs etc I have collected since 2001 or 2002 (can't recall the start date right now!).  I will state up front though that applicants with the most applications did not necessarily have the most interviews.  I'm not sure if this holds across the board as a trend, but 100-200 applications is a lot to send out while tailoring an application for each vacancy.  

So, here it is.  Of the 136 respondents 
34.6% applied for 1-5 academic jobs
20.6% applied for 5-10 academic jobs
21.3% applied for 11-20 academic jobs
10.3% applied for 21-30 academic jobs
6.6% applied for 31-40 academic jobs
3.7% applied for 41-50 academic jobs
0.7% applied for 51-60 academic jobs
none applied for 61-91 academic jobs
2.2% applied for 100-200 academic jobs. 

Then, of the 136 respondents...
(57.4% got at least one phone interview)

42.6% had no phone interviews
25%% had only one phone interview
13.2% had two phone interviews
5.9% had three phone interviews
5.9% had four phone interviews
3.7% had five phone interviews
0.7% had seven phone interviews
0.7% had ten phone interviews
0.7% had thirteen phone interviews

Campus interviews 
(58.8% got at least one campus interview)

zero = 41.2%
one = 33.8%
two = 16.9%
three = 4.4%
four = 0
five = 0.7%
six = 0
seven = 0
eight = 0.7%
nine = 0.7%
ten = 0
eleven = 0
twelve = 0.7%

Job offers 
(29.4% got at least one offer). 

zero = 67.6%
one = 24.3%
two = 4.4%
three = 0
four = 0.7% This should say a lot about this year's job field.   My guess is that this %age is pretty darn close to reality. 1) Am I the only one that finds it a bit hard to believe that a 59% on-campus interview rate and an overall 29% success rate seems a bit high? Not that I don't believe the results of your survey, but that sounds a little optimistic in general based on what I've heardl, and even what's listed on the wiki survey tab... 2) Agree with #1. People who got an offer were more likely to fill out the survey?  3) that depends.  There was a huge variation in the nubmer of jobs applied for.  If you only apply for 1-5 jobs in an entire year you will probably be pretty unsuccessful, and over 1/3 of respondents fell in that category.  Also, we do not know how many of those who were offered multiple jobs saw their declined positions offered to an alternated candidate.  There are a lot of variables here.  This is a very cursory examination, but lets face it, if only 29% are getting jobs, and most positions interview 2 candidates (at least my experience is that most interview only 2, even when they say they are interviewing 3), it means that many positions were not filled.  29% is a ridiculously low success rate compared to other professions. (4) or is it 59% of those that had a phone interview got an on campus interview? and 29% of those folks got an offer? i have been quoted a 7% success rate is good for any given person (7 out of 100 applications will get an interview or job offer, I can't remember which). 5) I would be very interested in seeing a breakdown of the percentage of ecology PhDs get a) R1 2) MS/SLAC 3) other positions. I have seen one paper that noted 14% for biology PhDs (or maybe it was biomed) PhDs got tenure-track jobs. However, I don't think they broke it down by institution type. Pollster) No, the percentages are the percent of the total (136) who took the survey.  I will try to dissect the numbers. The biggest failure on my part with the survey was not asking about papers in to tier (PNAS, SCience, Nature) journals.  But, I don't think that will be a major factor anyway.  Most people don't have them when graduating anyway, believe it or not.  I really expect the number of applications ot be the most critical factor, followed by if they already hold a PHD. 6) These numbers actually look pretty good to me!  I do wonder about publications/grants/teaching experience and how that is ultimately what gets you an interview....and luck of course. #1 again) I appreciate your effort in getting some broad stats on this season, but I have say again that your results don't seem applicable to the real world. There's just no way I can accept that nearly 30% of applicants get jobs...that's got to be at least an order of magnitude high. From talking to many SCCs, most postings get 100+ applications for a single job. Unless there are only a few hundred people out there all applying for all of the same jobs (like, 200-300 given the number of listings each year), the overall success rate has to be closer to 1%. Of course teaching experience, pubs, recs, application docs, luck, and many other factors play a role in an individuals success. Each of those having different weight depending on the job. A simple survey with 136 respondents, with a likely and understandable bias towards successful candidates, just isn't going to get the job done. Maybe a more nuanced survey, released a few times over the season, would be better next year? I feel lucky that I got a VAP this time around, back to the TT grind in a few months! 8) While I appreciate the survey, I agree that it may not be as applicable. Maybe it is just because I didn't get a job this time!---But 30% job offer rate does seem high. This link is interesting: http://www.ascb.org/ascbpost/index.php/compass-points/item/285-where-will-a-biology-phd-take-you. It includes biology (not ecology/evolution specifically) but notes that <8% of PhD students get tenure-track jobs (of course many PhDs don't ever look for academic jobs so there is a bit bias in that number too). Also, the data in this link, at least in part, are from 2008 before the crash and when the job market was better.  7) You can't quote stats like 1 offer/100 applications.  Its more complex than that.  Some subdisciplines might have 5 openings a year, others might have 500.  Those are nonsense data that are meaningless aat any level. ","Got an email from the search chair asking if I was still available for a position I wrote off (interviews closed 8 weeks ago!), I said that I was, then have been waiting to hear back (4 days). Finally did and now have a bad feeling they are going to re-interview me and/or other people who were not selected for the position originally. And that sounds like maybe the worst thing ever. My colleagues have told me it sounds like they are going to offer me the position but they are just bound up in admin stuff.... but I dunno. I don't know how to re-interview. Any suggestions? 2) It sounds like they offered it to someone else who then turned them down (just a guess). I can't imagine they would re-interview you. This seems expensive in terms of their money and time. I have never heard of that happening. I wouldn't worry about how to reinterview unless they ask you to reinterview.3) same thing happened to me. Just got the job. Don't sweat 4) Yep...I just heard from a SC that I should be getting some good news. I haven't heard more in the past 5 days. I think they just need to get a package together and get the dean and others to sign off on it. This can take awhile. 5) Good for the SC for keeping you in the loop despite not being able to give you the full story. The rules are just as frustrating for them as they are for you, but they can send you signals. I have a colleague who was recently the second candidate to interview out of three. She recieved an email from the SC with real estate information, and that email was sent during the third candidate's job talk. I'd say that's a strong signal. 6) OP again. I was invited back for a meeting just with the SC and the dept chair and wasn't asked to prepare anything just show up. ? I have no idea what's going on. I want to assume this is all good, but I am terrified that they have some series of difficult questions to ask me that I hope I will be prepared to answer. Ugh. 7) This is really strange. Good luck! 8) If I had to guess, it sounds like they may have offered the position to someone else and it didn't work out (or there was some messy administrative delay). In either event, that they are inviting you back to meet with the SC and dept chair suggests they like you enough to have the details worked out among two influential people - it sounds like good news. 
 (9) Yeah, this isn't venting, this is a humblebrag. Congrats on the impending offer.10) Simply ask teh chair what to expect... 11) Tell us what happened when you get back, please!
12) OP. First of all, no. I was not bragging. I was venting because this has been beyond frustrating. I understand it is a legal process, but it was killing me all the same. The job was offered to someone else and they dragged the negotiations out while they lobbied their home institution for a better deal. Not uncommon, but I was the person on hold because of it. On Friday, the dept chair called me to offer the job, and he made the negotiations move swiftly from there. Now awaiting the contract. Thank you for those of you that suggested the offer was coming. It gave a sliver of hope that turned out to be the best thing I could possibly have asked for. There is a lot of good info on this site that has rung quite true through my experiences the past 3 years of being on the market. For what it's worth, state institutions are bound by more severe legal dynamics than private colleges are. When I have had offers from the latter, they have come quickly after the interviews close and move up the admin ladder more easily. The process for this job has taken almost 3 months to complete, from close of interview to contract (with a 2 month delay due to first offer person). It is totally weird/awful/torturous being the person that was put in mental purgatory while person #1 strung a committee along. Thanks again for the perspective. 
13) OP again. Got the contract, negotiated, signed it, and am starting in fall. Thanks for the feedback and to the people who maintain the site. ","VAP/TT Some VAP positions end up providing a running start for the VAP in a tenure track hire that occurs while they are at a SLAC. Forget how often it happens and let's just say that we all know that this occurs in at least some SLACs. I don't begrudge it, but I'm just curious if it's possible to figure out whether a tt hire is in the pipeline when a VAP spot is advertised. I've seen this mentioned in an ad exactly once. Point being: does one ever know this is the case when they go for a VAP spot? Do you ask during an interview? It seems like a highly useful piece of information. Not exactly my plan, just curious because there are so many VAP spots being advertised now. Do the people who apply for those spots ask, or does it not matter to any of you who are applying?  2)  many schools will say they do, but lie.  check how many current faculty were hired as ntt first.
(3) You can ask, in email or during phone interview, ""What is the source of the position-- sabbatical, buy-out, growing department, etc.?"" Doesn't disparage the visiting gig, gives them a chance to volunteer the potential for TT if it exists. 4) if nothing else, taking a VAP allowed me to negotiate early tenure at my current institution (new place is allowing me to use my VAP year toward tenure).","I hate to say this, but do the gay folks feel unfairly discriminated against at interviews? 2) There has definitely been an assumption that I have a heterosexual partner.  I'm single and bi.  It's obnoxious. 3) I have had very condescending statements made in passing like ""Oh so-and-so downtown is great for folks like you!"", or ""You guys always dress and smell so good!"" WTF?!  4) I always felt like the discrimination is much more social than professional. But other people may have other experiences. 5) I have to admit that I act straight at interviews.  6) Told a friend I was wearing a vest on an interview.  She said, ""No!  Don't do that!  You'll look like a dyke an no one will want to hire you.""  Friend knows I'm bi.  Great. 7) Respondent #3 - I for one, would LOVE to know where the queer-friendly spots are in any place I wanna move anyway. And thanks for noticing - I wear Versace pour homme! ;) ","Feedback for search chairs pt. 2 A genuine search chair-department chair team came to me to ask for a list of advice and do's-and-don'ts like the one we were trying to collect below until it got sorta.... focused on personal questions. I think we came up with the following list so far: 1--Don't ask personal questions (e.g., about spouse or kids). 2--Give candidates a decision timeline--and stick to it! 3--Schedule meals, and, ideally, breaks for candidates to have snacks/use the facilities/gather thoughts. 4--Communicate clear expectations for talks (e.g., audience, format, timing) to all candidates. 5--Get the candidate a draft schedule at least 48hours in advance. What am I missing? Thanks in advance for adding to the list! (See the venting tab for more ideas.) 6- please don't plan parties after dinner.  If you want to have a party, make it include dinner.  12 hr days are long enough.  7- Get back to the candidates quickly about scheduling if you are requiring them to purchase (with reimbursement) their airline tickets.  8- ideally, don't make candidates front the money for airline tickets or rental cars.  if you have a few of these in a few months, it can add up to a lot.  9- reimburse candidates for per diem on travel days.  10) I really prefer to get myself to/from the airport, especially after the long trip.  I won't feel neglected if I am not scheduled every minute of all 2 days.  Most faculty hate airport trips and breakfast visits, and so do a lot of candidates. 11) I show up in knight armor to prevent anyone from attacking me.  12) Yeah, tell your faculty not to be rude.  I know some peole favor other candidates, but it does not make your department look good when faculty act out. 13) to #12. Yes. That happened to me before. Someone had a favored candidate and was giving me shit the whole time. 14) I've wished in hindsight that I had known the outcome of the search and could easily have tossed shit back on some faculty during the interview for comments and questions that were really out of bounds, such as not deserving certain publications or grants. x2 15) I (as a candidate) disagree with 6 and 10. Maybe the budget doesn't include dinner for the entire department, maybe they want to have the party after faculty have had time to deal with their kids' evenings, etc. One of my after dinner social gatherings started around 7:30 and was over by 9. Long days are just part of the interview process. Re. airport trips and breakfasts, the department may use them to get in as many meetings as possible in a short time. I also got a brief tour of the area on our way from the airport to the hotel. 16) In response to 15, the parties can last well after 9.  On the second day, that's a bit much.  The breakfasts and rides to the airport can be helpful.  17) Don't spend the entire dinner talking about obscure gossip/politics.  It's inappropriate and makes it seem like you aren't taking the candidate seriously. 18) Agree with #15. If you fly me to your town to interview I am more than happy to deal with long days. In my experience they are exhausting, but worth it. 19) Interviews are tiring, but I do not like to have breaks. It is awkward to sit in a temporal office alone. The only break that I appreciate is the one before dinner. 20) Make sure to include enough set-up time before the candidate's talk that they can use the bathroom, deal with any technical issues that might arise, eat a snack (especially if the talk starts at noon), etc. even if their meetings run late. OP) Thanks everyone! (And keep 'em coming) SCC and Dept Chair extend their thanks.  22) Setting me up so that WiFi works before I get there is super helpful.   23) That adorable B&B seems really nice, but for an interview with random flight times I'd rather have the option of check-in whenever I need, and a requesting toothpaste at reception if I forgot mine, and no rando inn owner trying to chat me up about how nice the garden is. ","So who else is waiting to hear back from campus interviews from job postings that never made it to the wiki? 2) Not me. If I applied to a place that wasn't listed, I made an entry. You could do the same. 3) That is kind of the point of the wiki! 4) Yes, it only works when everyone does their fair share. We aren't there for you, we're there for everyone. 5) Well, this is kind of forgetting folks who find the wiki AFTER the due date.  I've met a few folks who have no idea about this place. 6) I don't think it's a bad idea to add the jobs after the deadline. The folks that are in the same boat may update now. I regularly add jobs here but there were a few this year that I realize weren't added until I received a rejection. 7) @5 Look for me at ESA hyping the wiki: http://www.fancydressball.co.uk/big_images1/adult-potato-costume-ac777-a.jpg 8) This year you should be a chicken coop or a blueberry! And which ESA do you mean? Ecological Society of America? ","applying for jobs as asst. v. assoc prof I'm considering moving institutions as an assistant professor (from SLAC to R1 or R2). Does anyone have experience with this? Are there any advantages to getting tenure at my current institution before moving on?  2) A lot of people say they want to see tenure when you move (simultaneously or just before), but this seems less true when moving from a teaching school to a research school.  If you have an active grant it will help a LOT.  Most people suggest not moving before year 3, just because you look like a flight risk.  But if a school is recruiting you before the app phase, don't let that stop you.  Your chances will be better if you have several papers from your lab and if students are making good progress toward their degrees. Some schools won't let you apply for assistant professor jobs if you are associate.  Send in the apps anyway. That year just when your tenure package is due may be the best time. 3) From my personal experience, my job interview numbers have gone down since receiving tenure, even though my publication and grant rate has increased. From my small sample size, I have only been getting interviews at jobs that advertise Assistant/Associate. It seems the Assistant jobs openings don't want anything to do with me. As a disclaimer, I've never assessed any of this quantitatively so there really might not be any significant difference...just my gut feeling. 4)  I have had the same experiences as #3.  Once I got tenure, I stopped getting short-listed for Assistant Professor positions.  I know have more success with endowed chair, open rank, associate prof, director, and dept. chair positions.  5) I feel ya, fellow tenured faculty.  Sometimes there is flexibility when a job is listed at the assistant professor level, but often there is not (the dean who approved the search only has so much $ to spend on salary and startup).  https://chroniclevitae.com/news/776-how-do-i-pitch-myself-for-associate-professor-positions has some good advice.","I received a job offer from a lovely place where I can perfectly balance a dinamic academic activity and personal life. I feel truly happiness is so close. But. I need them to accomodate my partner (and as a tenure-track). So, I most probably won't have any of this happiness that I believe I really deserve. I am so close and so far. 2) Dump the spouse. Choose happiness. 3) follow up to @2, spouses are probably easier to come by than academic jobs, especially a perfectly balanced job! j/k hopefully they accomadate your partner, goodluck! 4)  I've known at least two ecology/evol profs that were in the late stages of their careers that had given up their personal lives to focus on their careers and both really, really regretted it despite being very accomplished researchers.  If possible, you've gotta find a good balance; it's hard, but it may mean living like paupers for another year or two until you get the gig that is best for you.  Don't settle and destroy your relationship 5) From an academic who messed up his spouse's career with a move, there could be ways other than academic job that lead to happiness for both x3 6) If spouses are easier to come by than academic positions I'm truly screwed x5 7) I just got a job, but still no spouse! I guess there is hope yet? 8) yeah, advice to young academics, never fall in love with another academic just because they are strong, independent, brilliant, and also understand you and your motivations and lifestyle so well. Instead pick somebody who is willing to move anywhere just to make you happy. It will really make it easier on the administrators at your future place of employment who can't stomach making a ""risky"" investment in a couple of people who are motivated to build productive programs in the same place and time, and prefer to undervalue you both until you break; you'll make them look weak, or mean, or both, poor things. Do I sound cynical? I sympathize, OP, very much. There will always need to be some level of compromise in any personal or professional relationship, sometimes the pros/cons are hard to weigh. 9) OP here. Thanks for understanding. You perfectly got the point. If I have to be truly honest, hiring my partner would give them 2 qualified people that perfectly fit the environment, and join their effort in being 4 times more successful (each) than I would be alone. Instead of communiting, we'd work on our freetime, and we'd be permanently happy without spending the next years to look for another place.","risky equipment purchases For folks who've already snagged a position: Have you ever looked into buying used genomics equipment? For example, I see thermocyclers, qPCR instruments, Fluidigm products, etc. on Ebay. Seems shady, but some instruments that might be out of reach for smaller places with small start-ups are priced within reach. Would it be crazy to take a risk and buy a nice-to-have-on-site piece of equipment with some start-up? Not sure how you'd even get the thing serviced...2) This is based on faculty I've asked about this, not my own personal experience, but they have suggested used buying new for the workhorse equipment, such as thermal cyclers, and used for things that are not used as often and won't slow you down if you do have trouble with it. One faculty member says he would never buy used again, but that was just one opinion. 3) Just get new ones if you can afford it. Shop around. There are usually new lab discounts for new PI which you might get a lot of equipment such as PCR machine at less than half the listed price. You just have to haggle with the sales rep and pit different companies against each other to get the best deal for your lab. Used equipment comes with no warranty and no service plans (for bigger items). You don't want to be stuck with a giant paperweight. 4) OP here. Thanks. Getting some practice haggling for equipment as a post-doc now. Whole new set of skills... 5) Also depends on the kind of equipment and your ability/willingness to tinker. My old PI got some great used electrophys stuff off ebay and, since he was good at electrical stuff, got it working (amps, etc.). Now working in molecular, I can't see this working with something like a PCR machine so I'd say that's hit or miss","https://twitter.com/mbeisen/status/1102785850696380416 . This is very true. A lot of superstar folks get a lot of offers (which is good and well deserved), while many talented folks did not get job offers because job searches fail. There has to be a better way. But for now, if you are one of the superstar folk, and have multiple offers, I know trying to negotiate for the best offer by pitting the offers against each other is within your right, but if you are definitely not going to take an offer, please let the school know, so that they can offer the position to No.2 candidate. Dragging the offer will lead to failed searches and one more talented postdoc unemployed x2. 2) https://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2017/10/26/how-often-do-faculty-searches-in-ecology-fail/. Don't generalize from Eisen's experience, it's not typical for ecology. In ecology, failed searches are rare, and only a fraction of failed searches fail because of protracted negotiations with candidates who have multiple offers. 3) I've seen searches in my department fail because a superstar eclipses the other candidates.  Superstar accepts a superior position, but the other candidates -- who are better than half of our current faculty -- were deemed unacceptable based on comparisons with the star.  Derp. 4) Departments also seem really bad at separating superstars from 'superstars' 5) Can we stop with the ""superstar"" thing? When connections seem to matter more than someone's actual record in many cases, I'm not buying it. x3 6) Some are making the argument that the ""superstar"" job market drives the entire job market: https://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2019/03/06/when-and-why-the-ecology-faculty-job-market-first-got-so-competitive/   7) A lot of the ""superstars"" are junior faculty trying to move up after getting a grant.  That's no comparison for a pdoc who still has to prove themselves. x2  Folks who are already profs can drag out searches longer.  I've seen plenty fail that way, which did lead to great pdocs hanging by a thread.   8) Regardless of whether superstars exist or not, I see a lot of overlap among universities in who they are bringing in to interview. 9)@8, those are the so-called superstars whom everyone wants to interview","Interview Qs for VAP? Any suggestions for phone interview tips for VAPs? I've had several phone interviews for TT positions, but considering the VAP is a temporary position, I'm wondering how to tweak the questions I ask at the end and also the questions they're likely to ask. They've specified the courses they'd like the VAP to teach, so perhaps questions will be specific to those classes? 1) Not a VAP but a teaching prof here...  Yes, you should have input/question on the classes you are going to teach. So look up the syllabus for each and think about content and question you have.  Ask questions about class size, support for classes, responsiveness of the students to active-learning and other questions about the students. You should also have examples of your teaching style, issues you've faced in the classroom, and how you integrate active learning into the classroom. Good Luck!","I was really thrilled this month to be offered a TT position from one of my top R1 institutions I applied for this year (which is great, since I only got 2 interviews out of 30 applications this year, and this was the only R1). Negotiations went well, they sent me blueprints of the lab they are renovating for the fall, the only thing left was for me to get the offer letter by snail mail, sign it, and return. I had literally been told by the chair to start watching my mailbox. ...Then all of this COVID-19 business started. Well, it turns out there was one last approval of my offer letter that didn't get done by the time the admin of the university were ordered out of buildings as part of a statewide emergency management effort. The university on that day also decided to suspend all open searches -which I feel like shouldn't have included my position, but thanks to that missing last signature on my offer letter, it did. I was starting to look at houses. I had told my parents. Now all I have is an email that says ""I hope we will be able to get you here in the fall"" but the suspension is indefinite. My fear is that, since this is a state institution, the state government could use a state hiring freeze to recover from the financial burden of the COVID-19 crisis (like many did in 2008), which would effectively terminate the position entirely. I actually lost my job as a research associate in 2008 as a result of a hiring freeze at a state institution in a different  state, so if this does happen it'd be 2 for 2 (lucky me). I also had my undergrad institution destroyed by a natural disaster in my second year of university. I just feel like I am done with this. Won't any stage of my career not be blown up in my face by some kind of crazy rare crisis event that has nothing to do with me!? Anyway, that is my vent. I am heartbroken. I really love this institution. The people there seem to just get my research. They seem like awesome folks I'd like to hang out with on the weekend. I just want to be one of them. It actually took me almost a full week to write this. I was so upset I couldn't even look at these boards since then. I want to believe everything will be alright and my letter will arrive in my mailbox some day, but I feel like I need to prepare myself for the worst case scenario. Oh right, I should mention that this was my first and only offer, and my postdoc funding runs out in August. [/vent] 2) I feel you.. I accepted an offer just before everything blew up in my face. Completed hiring paperwork, but told under normal circumstances the contract could take a while to come. Now Im unsure where I stand, whether I am officially in the hiring pipeline, or if the rug could be pulled out from under me at any time. Haven't bothered to ask because I feel like there's more important things for everyone to worry about right now, and it's not going to change the reality. ust going to hope that my position is secure, the paperwork hit, and it's just formalities now. 3) I'm to some extent in the same situation like you. The departmental chair emailed me several times that an offer would come to my mailbox, but that never happened yet due to this coronavirus situation. On the top of that I was negotiating on another offer, but due to this pandemic situation that school stopped responding too. Not sure if that was a right move to not accepting the offer without negotiation! 4) That's devastating...I'm so sorry :( 5) Just had an campus interview at an R1 institution that I felt went pretty well, then got an email just now saying upper admin has issued a hiring freeze due to the virus. Wonder how many people will be in this boat and if it'll roll into subsequent years. If the economic damage is lasting (and thus lower tax revenue and university funding), we may see an even further slump in the academic job market that will persist for a long time. 6) I've heard from friends at other places that their institutions have already instituted hiring freezes for next year. At this point I think it is more about the fact that they don't have the bandwidth to process and approve hires. If the economy doesn't recover those will probably extend. 7) was told I'd hear something from a position I interviewed for by now, nothing.  don't want to bother the search, but curious if the pandemic will - understandably - be altering their time line. ugh! 8) These are the most worthy vents I've ever read. I'm so sorry for you all and fingers crossed. 9) OP here. I just got a rejection email from the other place I interviewed this fall/winter. It's stings a little to know that the university that didn't want me was able to wrap up their search with no problems. 10) New poster but similar just happened to me today. I am devastated. Solidarity with the other posts, for whatever that is worth. 11) This vent should be give a gold star - I feel you.  I just signed an offer letter electronically, but who knows how well it will stick given economic down turn that surely will happen. 12) I've verbally accepted an offer but awaiting the formal written offer and my contact at the university has stopped responding. Getting worried. 13) OP and others: This is a very unfortunate situation, but also something that does happen in non-pandemic years. The sequence of your offer-procedure seems unusual. Typically, you would get an emailed version of the offer letter, signed by everyone necessary first, for the purpose of any further negotiation. If you didn't get that, then you were truly still negotiating the terms of the first letter, including your teaching, startup usage, benefits etc.. These cannot have formally offered in detail by a simple conversation. Look at someone else's offer/startup letter, and all of the language and pages of stipulations including the time to respond. A verbal intent to offer is not the same as an offer letter. This is why you should never report having an offer, or stop entertaining other options until all parties have signed the contract. You did not get an offer. This is awful, becuase it sounds like you were on the brink of getting it, and their first choice. 14) @13 You are not wrong, but I don't think anyone here is venting because they were confused about the process. No one has said that they turned down other offers prematurely, or that they announced their position anywhere. Rather, what is most concerning about the present situation is that searches at large are being put on hold or cancelled altogether, so for many people ""other options"" dissapear, or have a stronger possibility of dissapearing too. This makes things inherently different than having a job fall through at the last moment in a normal year. In the OP's case, it sounds like they had no other offers right from the start, so your advice is particularly not useful in this case. These are just unusual times. Perhaps even more so than in the past a lot of things are out of our hands. We make the best decisions we can and then we just have to wait to see what happens. 15) I feel you on this. Had interviewed for 3 jobs before shut downs started - one back in DECEMBER - who in Feb said they still hadn't made a decision. That job is now on hiring freeze. One has been non-communacative. The other I apparently just missed out on - which is heart breaking bc it is advancing their recent hires. The last applications I had out have all contacted me to say hiring is suspended. I'm in a foreign country, on a work visa, I'm already part time now, and my contract ends in June. I can't apply for some jobs here unless I'm at least a perm resident. I don't know what comes next. 16) If you know about a covid-realted canceled search or rescinded offer, it would be very helpful to fill this information in the faculty jobs spreadsheet.  Instructions on how to tag a post are in the ""General Discussion"" tab under the ""canceled searches/rescinded offers"" topic 17) After I accepted an offer a week ago I was really looking forward to a reduction in stress levels, but now there's the whole anxiety of whether the hire will still go through or not given everything going on...on the one hand, the provost was the one who gave the okay for my increased salary request, but on the other hand everything is so fluid right now that I'm super worried. I've been on the market a few years and this year things finally seemed to be falling my way, but now everything seems to be going to hell again. I sympathise with all of you--this shit sucks  18) OP here. Yes, ""fluid"" does seem to be the blanket term they are useing doesn't it? Last week they were supposed to have gotten back to me about whether this search was going to be officially terminated or not (based on summer enrollment). I sent an email yesterday morning. No response so far. I am left to wonder if A. the job will come through this week, B. they'll cut me lose, or C. I'm going to get a healthy serving of the academic job ghosting we all know and love. ","Delayed TT Start in COVID Times? I'm wrapping up my dissertation and intend to graduate in August. I applied for a TT position at a land-grant (70% extension, 30% teaching) back in April. Seemed like a good fit. Unexpectedly, I made it through the interview process and got offered the job. The job ad didn't list a start date. There was some indication that a start date of mid August was preferable during the interview, but nothing definite. How much am I potentially shooting myself in the foot by requesting a delayed start until January, especially with COVID-related hiring freezes and all? Professionally I could swing it (although it would be insanely stressful), but I don't see how a start date in less than 2 months is feasible from a personal level especially when I just received an offer via email (no official letter yet) today. Any insights or advice? 1) I'd be nervous delaying because the Fall is still an unknown financially for universities. Maybe you could still start mid August, but remotely? Might minimize the stress while getting your appointment finalized. 2) As someone who is 6 years post PhD in a VRAP position, my recommendation is that you take the damn job at whatever start date they want you.   3) If you want the job, start when requested. x2 4) Yea my comment isnt going to be constructive, but this jsut pisses me off. How are you getting an offer for a TT position if you arent smart enough and lack the common sense to figure this one out on your own? You know the economy is in a shitter right? And hiring everywhere is frozen? 5) No need to be rude - it's an honest question. Unfortunately, you don't have much leverage. It's possible they would accommodate you, but it's also possible it could hurt you. Although I usually suggest that you negotiate for things that are best for you personally, it may be that simply starting when they ask is the safe route right now. If you do try to negotiate anything, you'll probably have more leverage with a signed offer letter than prior to that, but that doesn't mean you'd have much more with one. Whatever happens, congratulations on landing a job, and best wishes with everything. 6) OP here - Thank you for the feedback. I understand this may have come off as a silly question and that I probably provided too much context for my particular situation. That was largely due to the axienty I was feeling about all this coupled with a lack of experience in this sort of situation. I should have taken a few deep breaths before posing my question here. Thanks again, all, and take care."
"Splitting the family To those of you who are living apart from your kids (the commuter marriage), how do you do it? I've been away doing my postdoc for less than a year now. Just got slammed with another rejection (29 applications, 2 interviews). Being apart from my kids and spouse is KILLING ME.  I love my work but I love my family 1000 times more. Yet, I gotta do this. I'm not sure I could take another year!  The rejections have been tough especially on my little one who is starting to get it. I shouldn't have even told them that there was a chance that I'd get a job. Now I know. This all sucks!!! (1) It sounds like you have to decide what is most important in your life. (2) Does being separated from your family increase your chances of landing the right job more than the 1000-fold suffering resulting from the separation? Like the rest of us, have you been told that you need to ""pay your dues"" and you feel that you haven't yet? Exactly how much are these ""dues"" anyways? Do our families have to pay our dues too? I realize that it's not as simple as that, and you might have kicked yourself had you at least not taken the chance to begin with. Nonethless, I wish you and your family all the best.  (3) I'm so sorry, it does sound like you've had some luck though - 2 interviews in this market is good!  I have no advice but maybe some reassurance.  When I was a kid one of my parents was denied tenure, I remember it and it was a little vexing at the time but it's certainly not a trauma I carry with me (heck I even chose academia despite that).    I remember with far more pain when my brother sent my barbie into the fireplace and singed her hair.  Kids are resilient.  I'm sure yours will not recall the rejections for long.  Best of luck to all of you!  (4) I have known more than one couple that lived on different continents during post-doc, pre-tenure.  I find it completely unacceptable that we are asked to do this or that it occurs to anyone that this is an acceptable arrangement.  I also know couples where one languishes along while the other has a career that moves forward.  You have my sympathies!  I really hope you can find a way to all live in the same location.  My spouse and I have made > sacrifices - but living in the same location (with the exception of field season) is non-negotiable.  ","Cal Poly, Animal Physiology Anyone hear back post-interview? The suspense is killing me... nope (1) Decision (for the search committee) delayed until July for unknown reasons... 2) Is this true for the community ecology position too?  anyone know? 3) Community ecologist position has been offered to one of the candidates. 4) Offered and accepted? 5) just offered, in negotiation", Scientists are snobs big time http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v495/n7440/full/495167a.html?WT.ec_id=NATURE-20130314,"Thanks!

Hopefully this doesn't change as the season progresses.  In years past the hostility and vandalism has gotten worse as time progressed and more and more people began to lose hope.

Then I am rethinking everything and likely moving on though. Not sure my family and I can do another year. 3) at least you are employed. 4) ditto to #3 5) I'm with the OP on this post. I've been a postdoc for 7.5 years and yet not one single on campus interview even though everyone says my CV is killer (over 20 pubs all in very high impact journals). I've got one year left on my postdoc, so I'm going to use it to transition to private industry or a gov. job. I'm not wasting my time anymore trying to get a job that's nearly impossible to get. Not to mention it's probably a miserable job anyway (being a professor really sucks these days according to my recent advisors, i.e., once you get the job good luck getting one of those elusive NSF grants, which you will need to get tenure). So, why the fuck am I wasting my time trying to get a super competitive job that nobody wants anyway?) Good bye academic biology! (8) going into 7th here too despite getting a major NSF grant last year (9) One more year  and then I'm going to transition out too. Does anyone have any thoughts on how to do that? Seems like gov jobs are equally hard to land. How do you transition from basic ecology to industry? 10) My friend just applied to over 100+ government positions before she got a job.  Most the positions they post for are currently taken but HR has to post them every year or every other year to be ""fair"" (I think it's an equal opportunities to veterans thing).  Whoever is hiring just writes a really specific job post for the person who currently has the position so that they will never find a better fit.","Interviewing for a VAP This is blank. I didn't make the row, but I would like to know thoughts and advice on the subject, or the OP's question.  2) Someone messed up the sorting (AGAIN!)
3) When you interview for a VAP, you have to be clearly interested in getting teaching experience. Know the kinds of classes they offer (look at the course offerings), class sizes, faculty (and student!) publishing rates in the department, and show them that you really want the job. The one recurring mistake I have seen people make when interviewing for VAPs is the teaching demo. If they ask you to give a talk on evolution or ecology, don't talk solely about genetics or physiology. This seems incredibly intuitive, but many people want to do what's easiest (which is to talk about your research). That is *not* what a teaching demo is. Yes, it is nice to hear about what your research interests are, but you should be spending the time in your demo *demonstrating*  the way that you teach. If you lecture, give a great lecture that is thought-provoking. If you do discussions, lead a great discussion that shows how you would interact with the students. Do not, however, try something new during a demo. Do what you would normally do in the classroom.  ","Dear person that rejected the million dollar startup on the negotiations page - can I have your job instead? ;) Congrats on your offer though - and I hope that you found a much more lucrative offer elsewhere! Kudos! 2) Thank you! 3) I just turned down an R1 generous start-up because my partner wouldn't move there. Very terrified now. 2) I get why that's scary, but no one makes these choices lightly and I'm sure you made the right one! I'm rooting for another job to come around for you. 4) Thank you! Its hard to explain why that makes me feel a bit better, but it does :)","Feedback for search chairs I feel like a lot of searches could use some constructive critisism on handling job searches.  Things like  a) don't ask applicants for info about their personal lives when considering who to hire   b) keeping candidates informed of the timeline makes your school look more put together   c) For heavens sake make sure the candidate gets to eat something during the day!!  Anyone know a good anon way to make that happen?? 2) Good idea. Why not collate suggestions here and then clean up for wider distribution? As a faculty member, it's easy to forget what it's like to be on the market. 3) As someone on the market, I feel that you are too sensitive. There is a difference between asking your sexual preferences, and being friendly and asking something that falls generally under ""personal questions"". Requesting for the hiring entitiy to not ask you ANY personal questions would be an absurd request in about any place other than the academic bubble. Any time I've been asked something that falls under this it was just people being people wanting to be kind and friendly. 4) Sorry but agree with A--sometimes yes people are just friendly but ?s directly about your partner shouldn't happen and shouldn't weigh into a schools decision. I have had a chair directly ask about my partner as important information in the hiring process--my personal life is my own and  I should be considered based upon my research and teaching experience and whether I will contribute and get along with others. There are plenty of other things to talk and be friendly about. 5) why are you assuming that they are asking to discriminate? I simply do not understand this logic. On my visits they have been asking for what appears to be either random conversation or to see if they can assist my partner with career opportunities. For those that have kids these conversations often go towards good areas with good schools, etc. Lighten up. BTW, I'm bisexual.6) as soon as the information is known it weighs into the decision whether conscience choice or not. you will never know whether it hurt you or helped you to share that personal information and I would rather have the decision to hire me be based on my career experience not whether I am bi, straight, single with a child, or whether my partner is a researcher . 7) it's pretty naive to think that during an interview that faculty will be thinking about how to help a partner find a job!  Faculty are screening candidates.  Faculty are in the power position, not the candidate at that point. Only when an offer is in hand, does the candidate have any power. So, if faculty get information that is independent of the search AND they are actively pursusing such information, the question is why? The answer then, of course, is that they are using that information to screen candidates. 8) Yeah, all of academia is out to discriminate against you. So appalling that anyone would try to have a personal conversation. Super scary. 9) I guess I'm naive then. Turns out my partner is getting a job related to the conversation I had with the committee during my first visit. So I'm glad I'm naive.  10) You are naive, that doesn't happen for everyone. you are lucky. no I don't think all academia is out to get me. I am a scientist that likes to avoid biases. Personal information about your partner can bias decisions whether you like to hear that or not. Also I would like to know if this is true--it is an article  about interview questions that are illegal-being married and questions about your personal status are stated as illegal: http://mentalfloss.com/article/64202/8-interview-questions-you-might-not-know-are-illegal?  11) Scroll down 25 lines to read the discussion under ""Major HR Flub/ Personal Questions"".  I wouldn't take legal advice from mentalfloss (or anywhere on the internet, including this wiki). 12) L. O. L. Let's go over to the venting page where you can call me naive in a more welcoming environment. I'll check back, but need to talk to my partner about their new awesome job due to the totally awesome and caring faculty that for some reason didn't immediately try to screw us over. 13) ""Well you probably won't fit in here, since you don't have kids""-- senior faculty member; ""Oh good, so you won't turn us down because of a partner.""  --faculty;  ""Well not everyone wants to live here because they can't afford a house.  We get turned down a lot over that, especially by women."" --dept head;  ""Well he's a better pick because he will actually come here.  The other candidate has  a partner and we're not sure she wants to live here."" --A GODDAMN SEARCH CHAIR 14) Sounds like it's good that you didn't wind up getting offered that job, #13! Would've been a shitty place to work with that kind of environment! 15) Naive commenter from abover here: uh, yeah there are shitty places and shitty chairs. I never said I ignore data. I said I don't make the absurd conclusion that every person I'm talking to is trying to screw me over. I only applied to good programs that are in good places with depts known as being highly functional. My experience is that any question asked that fell close to ""personal"" was not intended to obtain info for search purposes. It was simply decent people being decent people. I really think that some of you need to get a drink or something...16) It is naive that a spousal issue won't come up if anyone in the room gets wind of it.  Not all departments or universities will have the funds for a spousal hire, even if the university has a policy. A good chair and a department knows their limitations, what will fly, what will not.  Yes, some people do not have evil intentions when asking if you are married or have kids, but that information can be used for other means, especially by individuals that may not be thrilled about your application because they'd rather hire their buddy. If you want the offer (why else interview), why give them information that can't help build your professional case? 17) Okay, so it comes up—and? They either have money for your partner or they don't. So say someone on the committee catches wind it's a dealbreaker. If it is a hard constraint (ie no money for dual hire) it would still be a dealbreaker if you refused to talk about it, just a few weeks later. What is the argument for hiding this? I would rather know as early as possible so I don't waste my time (or theirs) if my partner needs TT job and it isn't possible at uni in question. I find interviews exhausting so I have no desire to go on one that I know cannot work out from the onset. 18) Actually it is a problem if certain people in the department use this against you.  If you get the offer and then can officially negotiate for your spouse through official channels, you are in a stronger position. If you talk about your partner in an interview, it can be used against you because you're navigating departmental politics, 10-30 people and perhaps several factions. After the offer is made, you're dealing with the chair, dean, provost, etc., a much smaller group and you are also covered under a number of legal protections. On interviews, I've been in the position where I've received a number of aggressive questions about my partner by individuals who were generally opposed to the search, according to the search committee. It's not too difficult to imagine that this added fuel to their cause. So, while they may not be opposed to spousal hiring, they had issues against ecology or evolution (vs. biomedical) and certainly had issues against hiring potentially two ecologists! So, while they may like you, they just may opt for the person equally qualified but is married to a lawyer, for example, who isn't going to disrupt their silly power hierarchy. Again, it's naive to think that this sort of thing doesn't influence a decision-we're al people and know that objectivity has its limits. That's why asking such questions is more or less illegal. Anyway, it's nice to hear that others live in a world where everything is fine and great. Just realize that you're lucky that the world is at your fingertips. 18) You [[which you?? A: me, you, and the other you's?]] have issues with passive aggression. Where are the relevant statutes about the legality of this? Citation? Also, I'm not lucky.   19) https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/practices/inquiries_marital_status.cfm 20) Naive here. I agree and support ideas in the link, but it provides no evidence that passing comments interpreted by you as semi-personal are illegal or malicious in nature. Too busy to argue, but I wish you all the best in your job search. I'm happy that I did not experience the negative environments that some here have.21) FACT: it is illegal to ask or use personal information (e.g., marital status, kids) in an interview. People can ask this for benign or ill purposes, but it is ALWAYS better to control your information rather than giving it to people who may wish to use it against you. This is really a simple idea. I'm surprised this is so confusing or hard for some people to imagine. 22) What is with the tone on here 21? This isn't a black and white issue, there is plenty of grey, and people are clearly discussing a gradient of comments, discussion points, etc. It is true if someone asks for this information and uses it to discriminate it is illegal. However, your blanket comment is not correct—ask any attorney. But, fact: it isn't helpful to come on this board and use this sort of tone. I'm so thankful that there are not people that use this type of condescending tone in my department. 23) It's not helpful to remind everyone that it's a dog-eat-dog world? OK. Let everyone else figure this out the hard way. #21 is correct.  Interviewing and holding a faculty position is about controling the information flow. Find a single academic who doesn't will yield one that is either deadwood, unemployed or about to be denied tenure. 24) I think anyone reading this can agree that discussion is helpful, but the middle school tone and condescension isn't. 25) I openly told committees that my partner is in a certain field and asked about opportunities in the area. I also asked where good schools districts are located, and was given a tour of those areas. I am interviewing them and the location to see if it is right for me so this info is important at the eonset to me. I found that having the info I collected made my ultimate decision easier.  26) But that only works if your partner is not going to be asking for a position at the university, whether it be a faculty position in the same department, college or school or a staff position. 27) It is definitely is easier in that situation, but I have friends with academic partners that were open from the onset and it helped them put the most energy into interviews open to the idea (ie if they say on day 1 there is no way a second hire is possible my friend just relaxed and saved the energy). My comment here and above is biased towards situations where you have mutliple interviews and can be choosy. 21) There are two positions here: 1) I don't like it when someone asks me something that is unethical or illegal (it is illegal to ask in some states, illegal to use discriminate everywhere, although proving this is essentially impossible) and 2) what's the big deal? The second position assumes a condescending positions (Okay, it happens, but so what?) The ""so what?"" is that it can cost you a job. Saying, ""well, if they're going to do that, you don't want to work there anyway"" is dismissive and also assumes you know how they think. There are lots of places I'd like to work despite the fact that the search chair makes bad decisions. If you've got hurt feelings about someone spelling this out, I think you have the kind of sensitivity to understand how it's hurtful for someone who loses a job offer because of their marital status. Bottom line: when someone asks you about your personal life (marital status, sexuality, whatever), you can't control how they will use it, and often enough, they can use that against you. If it is used against you, you have virtually no recourse, particularly in academia, where there are enormous numbers of people who are qualified. No one has ever said this is the case everywhere and anywhere (a straw man) - we'd just like it to not be an issue. It's kind of like drunk drivers - no one ever said every single one will kill you, we'd just like to eliminate them because the odds are high enough they will kill you. LOL) No one disagreed that discriminating is bad. No one disagreed that asking about partners is less than ideal. Some disagreed with blanket statements about personal interactions being negative. As for, ""if you've got hur feelings about someone spelling this out..."" lol. You are hilarious. Seriously. Did you get the tomato job? ","Rejection emails are starting to trickle in over the last few days from jobs I applied for between September and November. I had figured out that I didn't get those jobs, but still sad. I admire the wording of the last one. ""Despite the quality of your application..."" Note that they don't specify what the quality was.. High quality? Low quality? It works for everyone! 2) It's the generic email they send to everyone. I had one before that says something like ""Despite your outstanding achievements....""; 3) I second that the rejection letters are sad, despite the clarity on their decision ways earlier. hopefully it can account for some sad closure. 4) Heck, a nice, polite rejection letter actually warms my heart. x3 5) Chin up.  I just got invited to interview for a job I applied for in December of  '15. 6) What? Interview invitation 15 months after you submitted the application?  7) I had an astonding number of official rejections this week.  Fortunately, ecology wiki crushed my dreams months ago so it doesn't hurt as badly. 5) in response to 6): yes. Nuts, right?","Negotiating a fair salary I have been offered a TT job in ecology at public R1 university. After conferring with the Dean, the Dept Chair made a salary offer that is the same amount that the past 4 hires have started at over the past 4 years (2014-2017). On the one hand, this seems very fair and equitable. On the other hand, starting salaries have not been adjusted in at least 4 years to keep up with inflation. In essence, the suggested starting salary would have less purchasing power than the same salary 4 years ago by several thousand dollars. Am I right to ask how the Dean comes to his figure and to point out that each successive hire is essentially getting paid less? I don't want to alienate the Chair or my new colleagues, but feel that I am negotiating from an objective, merit-based view. I also want to avoid haggling. What is the best way to proceed?  2) Look up starting salaries for people in your field and see if it is below average.  Use the wiki, Chronicle Higher Ed, the state released salary stats, etc.   In evolution I'd ask them to top up anything under $70k.  Most colleges try to be equitable across depts, though chem+compsci earn more. You might still get stuck at $65k, but it shouldn't be lower.  In a high cost area it's common to offer close to $75k with no counter offer.  Ask for 5-10k more than you want. Compare the request with the increases that pdocs got recently from NIH.  You should not be below pdoc scale ever.  Talk about increased responsibility, etc. Be very polite but don't apologize for yourself.   If they can't pony up on salary ask about other benefits (health ins, daycare if needed, dept covered computing whatever).  Don't bring in life situation unique to you, just responsiblity and compensation.  Good luck. And remember this is purely business.   If they get upset over you advocating for yourself, they are jerks.  3) OP, you are at a public R1, so salaries are going to be public, so you can find out the salaries of the other members of your dept. Ask for too little, you lose out financially, ask for too much, you might get jealous colleagues who are more senior than you but get paid less than you (salary compression). I disagree with #2 that you should compare between people of your field. Even between public R1s, there is a range, from 75 to 95K for a starting asst prof. You can't ask for 90K at a place where the starting average for asst profs are the mid 70s. In essence, whenever you want to ask for something, you have to justify it. Saying that the starting salary being the same as 2014 means that your salary has less purchasing power is a good justification, use inflation rate and the number you are given to come up with a number that would sound reasonable and justifiable to the chair and Dean. Try to avoid ""merit-based"" justfication i.e. you have two more nature papers in your postdoc than the last hire, so you should be paid more. You are now judged on what you can do in the future, not what you did in the past. And by the way, congratulations on your offer. That's fantastic news. (#2 agrees w/#3 wholeheartedly) 4) Don't feel bad about asking for a higher salary, it is basically expected that you will negotiate. It sounds like you have a good reason and your initial salary is where future raises will start from.  Even an extra $2K/yr will add up over your whole career! 5) Thank you for your great advice, everyone -- OP. 6) This was a tough one for me too, but a little less than the OP! Before I received the official offer, the last hire (the year before) told me their offered and final salary. I was offered the same ""final"" salary from the last hire and I requested 3.5% more but the chair would not budge on the salary offer (I didn't have another offer, only another interview). 7) Wow, turned down a 3.5% bump! In the business world, you would tell them to piss off. In biology, you will probably take it. My rule of thumb has always been ask for 10% over what is offered, and be happy with any bump. Of course, I'm too big of a wimp to play hard ball, so I always say something like, ""it would make my decision to cancel my other interviews a lot easier if the salary was closer to X."" I got 5% over the offer at my current job doing that. 6 again) well, my offered salary was VERY generous so 3.5% was quite a bit of money. I think they declined my counter because 1) salary compression - I would have been paid more than the last hire, and 2) the state just cut a ton of funding to the uni. Overall, I am more than fine with my salary but I had to at least try! 8) I didn't think salary was negotiable in my offer, so I instead asked for other things including child care and full tutition remission for my spouse. I explained that until my spouse got his degree, we would be a one-salary family on a very tight budget, and that's why I would need those things. They couldn't give me either of the things I asked for, but instead bumped up my salary by 2K. So, this is just an example of how you might negotiate on salary indirectly. 9) I would consider whether or not faculty have been getting raises - for instance, if you're getting offered the same amount as the last 4, and neither of them have had any raises since, you'd be asking for more. If they have gotten cost of living raises or something similar, I'd be inclined to ask for their offer plus the cost of living raise. 10) It also depends if your appointment is 9-months or 12-months. Sometimes the chair may not have flexibility over your basic salary but would have some flexibility in negotiating your summer salary as part of your start up package in the first few years. Those add up to a lot of dollars! 10) OP here. Thanks for your advice, everyone. Was able to get a fair bump by negotiating on the merits. Compound interest is amazing. A $2,000 increase at the start of one's career will add up to $120k-250k extra in total lifetime earnings (assuming 2-5% annual raise over 40 years)."," x2In light of Trump's new proposed rule asking all new visa applicants for 5-years-worth of their social media handles, I've spent much of the day scrubbing my social media accounts of anything that might be deemed politically intrusive in U.S. politics, especially to the right, since I just got a job which means I'll be applying for an H1-B and green card. For a year or so now, I've also been censoring myself to head off the leftist online mobs that want to take your head (and your job) if you violate their political orthodoxies. It's a lonely time to be a political centrist, at least in public. 2) It seems ridiculous to be deemed inadmissible for expressing (presumably non-extremist) opinions on social media. Although, so many ridiculous things happened in the past couple of years, it kind of messes with your head when trying to evaluate what is a reasonable and non-reasonable development. Also, if an account is in one's real name, I'd think it would be looked at anyway. I'm in the similar situation regarding visa application, and I decided not to delete my opinions on social media even if the proposed requirement goes through. People can have differing opinions and have a dialogue, and I don't think they should be intimidated to agree with whomever is in power.  3) Are you sure you're not a libertarian? We're coming for your toothbrush, not your head. 4) I don't understand why anyone would still use social media. It's basically a tool to steal all your data, while shoving commercial or political propaganda straight into your brain. Wake up. 5) Thank You! I would also add that social media use is strongly linked to depression. 6) LOL, a 'political centrist' who rails at the 'leftist online mobs'...gmafb. 7) OP: It's a lonely time to be a centrist. 3: You're not really a centrist. 6: gmafb. ...QED. 8) You better get your visa soon, or have a job at an decent R1, bc HR 170 is slated to raise the min salary for H1B to $90k. Nobody should care  what you thinkpolitically anyway because you won’t be able to vote in state or federal elections. 9) OP here: Thanks @8 (and @7 I guess?). I do have an offer at a decent R1, but these visa issues certainly give the negotiations some urgency. Hope it works out. Despite all its problems, I think the U.S. is great, and still a world-leader in many respects, certainly including higher ed. Hope it stays that way (in terms of good higher-ed institutions) and that I get to stay. 10) off the top of my head, I can only think of faculty who lost jobs due to right-wing mobs after social media statements (Steve Salaita, George Ciccariello-Maher), not the inverse... 11) This is why the US government doesn't need to put out official censorships. They have these policies in place to ""enourage"" people and the media to self-censor. One faculty in my grad school used to tell us that he considers himself a dissident when it comes to American politics, but he keeps his opinions to himself in fear of jeopardizing his career, and this was before Facebook and all the social media days (and he's American). 12) @10, actually there are lots of examples of people who lost jobs (admin, faculty, or both) because of left-wing mobbing, e.g., Bret Weinstein and Heather Heyeing, Mary Spellman, Larry Summers, Tim Wolfe, Erika Christakis, Tim Hunt, etc.; almost Laura Kipnis and Nicholas Wolfinger (though they eventually beat their inquisitions); plus other mobbings like Alice Dreger and Napoleon Chagnon, Rebecca Tuvel, Christina Hoff Sommers, etc. In EEB, a couple of examples of people who have been mobbed recently by the left include Franck Courchamp, Corey Bradshaw, and Ray Hilborn. Oh, and there's all the studies showing that people discriminate against conservatives in hiring, etc. (https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/08/opinion/sunday/a-confession-of-liberal-intolerance.html). So I don't think it's fair to say OP is entirely paranoid about the LW mobs. 13) Tim Hunt lost an *honorary* position because he was bad for PR. Tim Hunt has a cushy life in Japan these days. Go and look up the actual consequences for the black woman who reported on Hunt, Connie St Louis, including but not limited to the racist abuse she received because various tabloids didn't do their homework on her CV. 14) Wow 12, nice argument. I wish we could have that level of evidence in all of the conversations here, and in our political spaces.15) Weinstein intended to sue his employer for allegedly perpetuating a racially hostile work environment, and resigned. I guess the racism against white dudes drove him out. 16) I'm sobbing uncontrollably over here like Jordan Peterson in a YouTube monologue, all because of the rightwing racist administrators who failed upwards due to left-wing mobbing... 17) 12 here. @15, he was mobbed for objecting to a day where white people were forced off of campus, and students then patrolled the campus with bats while campus police told him to stay away for his own safety, all while the administration did nothing. So, actually, ya, in arguing that it was a racially hostile environment, he had a case (which is why they gave him a huge settlement). Believe it or not, even though white people have a lot of advantages, some people out there do hate them. (Including you?) And race-based hatred = racial hostility, which is what Weinstein alleged. But let's see how far you're willing to take the 'one can't possibly be racist against whites' argument. Was the Fresno shooter not a racist? @16 your comment demonstrates the same ignorance as the left-wing mobs who drove these people out: first, because calling anyone they don't agree with 'racist' (or 'sexist') is the calling card of the LW mob; second, because many of the people I listed weren't even accused of racism (e.g., Summers, Kipnis, Wolfinger, Dreger, etc. were accused of other 'isms'). 18) I still can't stop crying over here (https://youtu.be/IvBm0ZUfe7I) 19) 12 again: OK, even I'll admit that's a funny video. (For the record, I also am not a fan of Jordan Peterson.) But none of this refutes what I said in 12 or 17, nor invalidates OPs concern. 20) Oh yeah, I'm a self-hating white person, clearly. Racism is structural, dude. I'd give him a settlement that was a tiny fraction of what he was suing for to get rid of him too, since he was a PR problem. Plus, white people weren't ""forced"" off campus, but maybe that's not how ""centrist"" outlets reported it. x2 20) When a comment about a politician begins with ""They are an idiot (or $umb@@@, or moron, etc.)..."" I wish they would keep their politics to themselves, right or left. A professor where I did my gradute work at would do this constantly. I would just turn around and leave. You can't have a rational disccussion about politcs with someone like that. 21) Trump is a dumbass. x1000 <- What a great way to win over his supporters... 22) Whats the point of trying? Facts become alternative and fake news to those people when they disagree with their opinions. 23) take the high ground and not be a jerk? 24) Isn't that what got us in this situation? 25) Isn't it childish to stoop to that level? Those that are already polarized on the left or right will not change their mind no matter what you do and insults only anger the other side. But there are plenty of people that aren't polarized that are open to other opinions. If you come out swinging, you have lost them before you could ever get to the facts. 26) No, I got to the facts right away - Trump is a dumbass. Fact. 27) @26, that is fake news. I am by no means a Trump supporter but a dumbass can't be as successfull as he has been in business. Yes I know all the stories about how he has filed bankruptcy, blah blah blah. That doesn't negate the fact tha he IS successfull in business. Calling him a dumbass doesn't help establish yourself as a credible source and makes you look like an ignorant polarized ideologue. 28) You mistake me for someone who cares what you think. Trump is a dumbass. @27) Ha! Yes, Trump must be an absolute genious to be born into a situation of wealth, inherit daddy's money, and get million dollar loans. Please, tell us about what business of his was successful! 29) All politicians are liars, cheats, and thieves. EVERY SINGLE ONE. deciding to play a partisan game is as pathetic as the whataboutism you just brought up. 30) Arguing against partisanism while making a partisan argument... 31) I guess I should be surprised that the wiki lasted this long without descending into political name calling. 31) This devolved into the whitest of  conversations. Also, is the OP trolling? Worried about persecution by Trump's USCIS or DoL for your right-ish leanings? Unlikely. Sounds like an excuse to bitch about academic lefties. Also unlikely that you'll be applying for an H1-B if you got an R1 TT (as opposed to an EB1 or O1). Are you making this ish up?  32)  I'm sorry, I wasn't paying attention. 33) For those just tuning in, @31 doesn't know what they're talking about re: visas. O visas are for pro athletes and elite entertainers. R1 TTs definitely apply for H1-B and then green cards. x3  34) Social media is a good way to find out about jobs and network too. I was told once I got short-lised specifically because a SC member knew about and my work from twitter. It's not all bad, but yes in moderation. 35) Aren't applications for H1-B's for faculty hires at R1s always approved, or no? My impression was that they were... 36) There's no cap, but AFAIK admission to the US is never guaranteed. 37) @36, have you ever heard of someone not getting a job at an R1 because their H1B app was rejected? 38) I'll just leave this here: ""What remains are 45 cases from 2015 to 2017 where a faculty member was fired, resigned, or demoted/denied promotion due to speech deemed by critics as political. Of these, more than half (26) occurred in 2017, the clear majority (19) being over liberal speech. This disparity persists even after removing terminations occurring in private religious institutions."" from: https://niskanencenter.org/blog/there-is-no-campus-free-speech-crisis-a-close-look-at-the-evidence/","Non-TT page 1) The non-TT page jobs are not visible, I think someone is applying a formula that isn't owkring for the rest of use. Please undo it! 2) Data > Turn off filter.","Gave a job talk/interview for a higher-level research position in another department at my current institute; ""Executive Director"" of department sat in the front row and played with their phone the entirety of my talk, didn't ask questions, didn't meet with me, or even bother to introduce herself to me at any point. Received a cold rejection email from their HR director (""limited fit for their current needs"") yesterday. I'm just sitting here thinking WTF was that? Feel like maybe they were humoring me because I'm internal and to maintain relationship with my PI.  2) Sounds like the director was opposed to internal candidates and you got caught in a piss war between profs.  Try to shrug it off as much as you can and apply to other jobs that look good to you.   Best of luck. 3) I am not sure people from another department in the same school are ""internal"" candidtates. 4) Search committee member here. @3: at many places people from another unit within the same uni absolutely are considered internal candidates. 5) Sorry @1 that is rough.

For example, list of faculty names, their research, potential collaborations. Does it look bad to look at it while you're in a meeting? 2) I would think it was a little odd to look at it in a one-on-one meeting, but in a more formal interview, you can always have it out with your notes and refer to it. 3) I've brought a notepad with a built in folder that has a page with brief info. If you're organized, I think it's fine. 4) I carried a cheat-sheet with faculty names/research areas and lists of questions for faculty/deans/chair. I wouldn't whip it out in front of anyone, but I would review it in the morning between meetings and at breaks. 5) I had a cheat sheet and a list of questions I wanted to ask. I whipped it out during every interview. I guess it didn't look bad, I got the position. 5) I carried a notebook that had a page dedicated to each person with questions and I'd write down notes and such there. It was great to check in between meetings to remember who is who. Didn't look bad at all, if anything, I'd say it made me look like I was fully prepared. x3 6) Thanks everyone. I appreciate your advice! 7) What else are you doing during your bathroom breaks? x3 8) I did the same as 5! x2","I know this is a job board but I feel my experience may help others negotiate salary or the joys of dealing with uni admin. I have been in a TT job in the US for a few years. During my time here we have hired several TT faculty (assistant profs) in my department. Salary data is public and all of the new hires are paid considerably more than myself, like 10-25% more! Which is great for them! We all have comparable CVs: pubs, teaching experience, grants, post-doc experience, etc. We all have backgrounds in the natural sciences, and some even describe themselves as eco/evo. We all have the exact same teaching, advising, service, and research expectations. I have been modestly productive, grants, pubs, grad students and all without a startup (they reneged on my startup after I was hired, that’s another story!). My annual evaluations are very positive, I have been told I am right on track for tenure. I’m not expecting we all receive the same salary, but 10-25% is a really large discrepancy for the same job with people of reasonably comparable experience (we are in the same department after all). I approached the admin (through the appropriate chain of command) and was informed that salaries are based on a database produced by an HR firm. This database is used to set the maximum a faculty member can be offered based on their “discipline” (not sure how that is defined or by whom). They classified me in a category (I’m not 100% sure what that category is) and my current salary is on par with what the database lists. The database is by subscription only, so I can’t simply look up my salary/classification myself. Basically, I was told to deal with it and I wouldn’t describe the interaction as supportive. Is this normal? What can be done about this other than simply finding another job? As we all know it’s a difficult job market with many talented applicants. It’s hard to expand your CV when you have a heavy teaching load and aren’t provided the support (start-up) as promised in the offer letter. I have had some modest success but no large grants our high profile pubs. Any advice anyone can offer will be greatly appreciated. 2) Sounds like your school has allowed a situation where salary compression has gotten bad quickly. Do you have a faculty union? I know our union has been heavily involved in getting current compression at least partially alleviated. 3) That is a tough one.  Some universities/colleges have opportunities to apply for ""salary equity"" raises, which are outside the normal promotion or merit raises.  Where I am at, you can apply once every 5 years, and attempt to make the case that you are compressed and deserve more.  Other than that, getting another job offer might make retention funds become available.  And what is with them pulling your startup?","So just how bad is the 2020-2021 job season going to be? Anyone care to speculate? if you know of any data sources/discussions, that'd be great too. 1) It is not looking good.  Over the last couple weeks, I have received more notifications of searches cancelled.  I think Universities are starting to make those calls now, and tenured faculty are worried they will start laying off pre-tenure faculty.  I had an on-campus interview at my Dream Job that was postponed, then the search was cancelled 2.5 mo later with no apparent plans on when to reopen the call.  I have only one search that I know they decided to continue with.  All others are still radio silent or have been sending notifications of cancellations.  Europe should be putting out lots of ads now. This is the season. And bascially, a dribble. This is going to be the worst academic job market for ever (including 2008-2009). Can you imagine discussing a search in faculty meeting when current faculty are taking a 10% furlough? Ain't gonna happen.... 2) I think if most universities are honest they still don't even know what the fall semester will look like, let alone beyond that. So much depends on public funding and other unknowns related to the economy. However, there will still be a few searches that continue because of real needs - but it will depend a lot on the program and the school. 3) My big state university is facing a 50 milliion dollar deficit for the 20/21 school year. In my department, the adjuncts have been let go and research faculty are taking on additional courses. I don't think we are going to get start up money from our college to hire new faculty, or from the university to renovate labs. One possibility is that bioinformaticians and folks that don't require labs or space renovations could be hired. It's hard to imagine, because right now we have spending limits on university accounts (internal grants), and most of my start-up budget is frozen.  3) Got an email today that a job search in Norway is moving forward (slowly, but moving). There aren't many European jobs compared to past years, but there are a few. I expect somewhere effectively near ZERO US jobs advertised this Fall. 4) If I were speculating, I would guess it would not be near zero. My guess would be somewhere between 25 and 50% of the normal number of jobs. Obviously still a bleak number for what is already an insanely competitive process... 5) I agree with 4.  One thing to keep in mind is that universities are always guessing not only about where their operating budget and needs will be this year, but also where they will be in 5-10 years. So they likely will hire less next year, but they may also be shifting their hiring to reflect where they think the long-term needs are going. If e.g. the bill overhauling NSF were to pass (https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/05/us-lawmakers-unveil-bold-100-billion-plan-remake-nsf) then you can bet universities will be guessing how they can hire/transition to be competitive for this money. 6) At my institution they have been implementing a staff hiring freeze for a few months but formally have not extended this to faculty positions (and do not plan for this in next year budget scenarios), though I imagine the number of searches will be lower than in a typical year. About those budget scenarios though... All the planning I've seen has been evaluating scenarios for next year, assuming something like a ""vaccine backstop"" where the bleeding is kept to the 2020-2021 academic year. If there are delays or complications with a vaccine then I'd expect a lot of the few searches to be cancelled, but on the other hand if the vaccine is quick and effective then you might see a bump of decent NTT positions come out late (at the places that can tap cash) to deal with pent-up demand"
"Reality bites Just a vent: I'm loving my postdoc, research is great, and advisor is cool.  But, job hunting sucks and rejections are hard to not take personally. Overall, I think I just miss grad school. I miss my old lab, my buddies and, I miss the blind optimism of my future in academia. *sigh* (1) ditto. Postdoc'ing seems like a weird sort of limbo with very few peers around. Not one of the grad students, certainly not one of the faculty. Makes me feel very isolated at time. I'm sure tears are now rolling down your cheeks. (2) I think of post-doc as academic purgatory. It is particularly limbo socially. But I LOVE my post-doc and kind of don't want to leave! (3) don't underestimate the postdoc, you'll look fondly on that as well in the future. 4) I LOVE my postdoc and would do it forever if that had any sort of future, sadly it doesn't. I will miss it but will also like the idea of being somewhere that's as they say on the SPCA sites a **forever home**, sigh now I'm comparing myself to a fostered dog (and kind of envying the dog) 5) Hilarious #4!!! sadly, I know EXACTLY what you're talking about *double sigh* (6) I have really enjoyed my post-doc time as well. I think it was a very needed and necessary time for me to mature as a researcher. However, I am getting tired of the politics of being in that limbo stage and am ready to start my own lab and teach my own classes. This fall will be a strange transition from the known and comfortable post-doc to the unknown and uncomfortable faculty. 7) I'm so ready to move on to starting up my lab. My postdoc has been good but, I did miss my grad lab and friends. 8) I'm with ya OP and can sympathize. It's almost impossible to not take rejections personally, especially post interview rejections. Everyone talks about ""fit"" being the ultimate criteria and when you think you are the best ""fit"" and get rejected, it's a huge blow to our egos. But, it really does get easier once some time passes by. I find that newer rejections actually help me move on from past ones. It's a weird mourning phenomenon but it works for me. It's an ugly process an all we can do is hang in there. (9) There are a couple of places over the years that I got to the final interview and was glad that I did not fit!!! 10) Ditto, #9 and ditto OP. OP, keep yourself busy, make new friends, and keep mailing in those apps. The first year of my 1st postdoc was very isolating. I too missed my grad days, especially my grad cohort buddies. But, I eventually made some good friends and my postdoc social life got much better. Going to all the departmental and various school activities worked for me. Aside from meeting other postdocs in my own department, I befriended postdocs from other departments. (11) I hate my post-doc. (12) Hate my life (13) I second that. (14) To #12 and 13, glad to know that I'm not the only one.","Frostburg Any news?  If they're hoping for an August start date, then I would think they would have at least done phone interviews by now. (1) aside from a ""still interested?"" email, not a peep. (2) Hmm, didn't even get that email.  When did you receive it? 3) Early May. It was a very informal email from a faculty member I met at a conference. (4) Any idea who to contact for an update?  The application went through HR, so I have no idea who is the SC chair. (5) received an email- short list made.  For an August start date, that seems pretty late.",  ,"interviews in Europe Does anyone know how/if European interviews differ from US ones, on the whole?  I'm especially wondering about candidates visiting simultaneously vs sequentially, job talks, and travel expense reimbursement. I only have an N= 1 on this, but my search involved simultaneous invites and a research symposium. There was no opportunity to meet individually with faculty, only with a group, and the questions they asked were a bit odd in some cases. Reimbursements were relatively smooth. 2) I have N=2 for UK interviews.  Both reimbursed everything and took care of arrangements for accomodations. It was the full interview group (5-8 candidates) there at once - one case a symposium style the other sequential short talks. In both cases talks were significantly shorter than US job talks. In one I had individual meetings with faculty but not in the other interview.  There's a real 'interview' with a set of questions they ask each candidate with the hiring panel.  Overall a more compressed interview style, you find out if you're offered the job in 1-2 days at most. 

I also only have an N=1 on this, I was offered a job at a research university in the UK which was based only on a remote power point presentation (they did not want to spend the money to fly me in) and a short interview over Skype. It was my understanding that the two other candidates were present for my talk but I'm not 100% positive. One really nice thing was that the committee made their decision and offered me the job the day after my interview. I wish American institutions could be so efficient.
","Post-rejection  At first, that rejection from my dream job is all-consuming.  I'm completely drained, full of despair, but I also feel secret, strange relief to receive external validation that I suck as much as I'd feared.  At least that certainty gives me one less thing to wonder about.  I slosh along for a few days, feeling like I'm walking through knee-deep mud but having nowhere to go.  Nothing has a point, nobody understands how it feels to have committed so:many:years to a profession that now I know doesn't give a shit about me.  I feel like I stare at the ground for days on end.  I can't even look into my partner's eyes.  Don't look at me, I'm nothing.  Weeks pass, and with the dreamy distractions of my pending dream job offers now gone, I start to remember projects I'd put off, papers I hadn't finished, analyses I hadn't quite yet wrapped up.  They suck, too, but they're a suitable distraction for the time being.  I spend a lot of time working on these things, more than I have in many months.  They still suck, but I'm starting to see why and even how I can improve them.  With my frantic attempts to prove myself to a mystery panel gone, I have a new focus on my work and a new perspective.  I start to remember why I do this work in the first place, what I'm truly interested in, and I re-focus on that.  I realize that my research statement didn't just suck, it didn't even describe who I am and what I do, something that I can see clearly now, just a few months after having it rejected again and again.  They were right to reject me.  But they weren't even rejecting ME, but some poorly-crafted version of me, written with the goal of fitting their position and not describing who I am and what I do.  Two months out from that awful trough of post-rejection depression I have a new purpose and a new optimism.  I see those jobs for what they were, *jobs*, I see what I did wrong, and for the first time in a while I can feel who I really am.  I know what to do and I know I can do it.  I can't wait to see this fall's job listings to feel that rush of optimism again, but for the time being I'm content--maybe even thrilled--to have a clearer picture of what I need to do to get one of those damn jobs. dead on.","Community colleges OP) Having receieved no offers from the SLACs/R2s I was applying to, I'm contemplating applying for community college jobs.  I enjoy a teaching-focused career and don't think I would be all that sad to leave research, frankly.  But I don't know all that much about the CC career path and I don't know anyone who has done it.  Does anyone have insights?  Also, any thoughts on applying to a CC job that ""only"" requires a Masters, if I have a PhD?  Thanks! 2) Community college is a perfectly respectable place to work.  Further, the pay and benefits provided in the large ones rival that of r1 universities.  In the small rural ones though, it can be a pretty bleak existence.  I have worked in that environment.  Its not bad, I'ld go back.  Despite claims, you really can do research while working at a CC, of course it depends on what you do.  At the one school I worked at there were several PHDs.  Some prefer PHDs.  The bad part is that they often prefer people with CC teaching experience, and some will tend to hire from their adjunct pools first.  However, I would apply anyway.  That is why I kept posting them on here when I saw them.  ","Who changed all the PhD dates on Anon Quals? PhD from 2014 but 6 years of postdoc experience, seriously? Have you no decency? 2) just make a new column if it's that important: 2015 - (PhD year) 3) I think the OP's point is that it is difficult to know if any of the information is useful if things are being changed or sorted in ways that mismatch the data among columns. It is interesting that there are some people here (hopefully a majority) who want the wiki to be a reasonably honest resource, and others (hopefully a minority) who think it is their personal toy and don't care if their actions screw it up for everyone else. Then anytime the reasonable people ask everyone to treat the wiki with a little respect, there is always some dismissive response like the one from #2. Get used to it OP - these are your future colleagues. 2) Not being dismissive, just offering fix. Take it easy, dude. These sheets autosave, sometimes you make a mistake that can't be undone. It's annoying, of course, but it comes with the territory. If something is terribly important to you, back it up. 4) sounds pretty dismissive to me. #3 could just as easily say 'stop making mistakes' and it would be just as helpful as you saying 'fix it yourself'. sounds to me like #2 has a lot of experience messing up the wiki. 5) Which jobs are you interested in #2?  I feel like doing some creative sorting on those posts. Hope you backed it up! 2) Negotiations. If that gets screwy, I'll throw my backup on here. OP here) All I was trying to say is that some of these changes seem pretty deliberate rather than simple mistakes. It's perhaps not a big deal for Anon Quals where you can pretty much tell what's false information, but in other cases (e.g., Academic Vacancies) you really cannot tell what's wrong and what's right. Anyway, it's probably not worth turning on each other. 6) I hate all of you. 7) Why not just download the doc if you're going to sort? 6 again) Okay, I hate everyone but #7.","Advice for campus interview at research school So, today one of my references called to tell me they had an interesting conversation with a search chair earlier in the week. Basically, the search committee at this mid-level R1 is concerned that I wouldn't go there if they interviewed me because, in their opinion, my CV suggests I'll have better offers and end up turning them down. The thing is I don't have better offers. My job search this year has been interesting - I get shortlisted but not interviewed at the big R1s, and I never hear anything from smaller R1s even when I fit the add perfectly. Is it possible that I will be unemployed next year because my qualifications are in some mysterious blackhole not quite good enough for the big schools but somehow intimidating to other schools? 2) Is the search chair friends with your letter writer, or did he/she just call for a reference? If they are friends, I wouldn't think any more about this. When I get calls from friends asking about their old students chances at a job at my university, I am always very vague. I don't want to offend my friend and say, ""your student isn't qualified"" or give them false impressions that their former student is great for the job when I know they are not. So, typically, I might say something like, ""well, they got a really competitive CV, but I'm not sure if our university is going to be the best fit."" Maybe this was the search chair's friendly way of saying that you are not going to get a job offer? 3) Not the OP, but I wonder about this too. Same situation for me. I'd like to say no, but I have heard people at smaller unis (~mid-level R1s) say that before, ie. that they would never be able to attract this person, so why bother interviewing them. 4) Probably department specific. We let the candidates decide whether or not they want the position (we just assume that all would take the position because they applied to the position). We just try to pick the best candidate. Administration can deal with negotiations. If negotiations go bad, we just sit and grumble and blame the administration. 5) I'm a tenured associate prof and I have to wonder if I have the same issue.  Have been looking for a new gig for last 4 years and have always gotten short listed and interviews prior to getting tenure, but this year I didn't make a single short list.  Of course, they say it's a ""fit"" thing, but that answer is so full of shit. 2 again, #5, you are absolutely correct. I tell people the ""fit"" thing only to be nice, which doesn't appear to be going over well based on the Wiki responses to ""fit,"" or b/c it's the most HR acceptable thing to say. It really means we found someone we like better, but qualifying/quantifying the ""better"" is difficult to impossible, and sometimes might not make sense quantifiably.  OP) I have had my fair share of ""not the right fit"" arguments, but that doesn't seem to be what this is. None of my references know the chair. All of my references have been contacted by phone and I have been told I am on a very short list. This was a second call to one of my references with the direct question of how serious I would be about taking the job and staying. My reference said he got the impression they were assuming (without saying) that I must be rolling in better offers. I was not considering this university as a stepping stone or a bad place to be, but this awkward insecurity on their part makes me think maybe I should see them that way. 6) In fairness, the number of really competitive people emerging from PhDs and postdocs may strike faculty who have been out of the job hunt for a while as way too qualified for a ""little"" place like theirs. Universities have done a great job of churning out a ton of good scientists with impressive records. Older faculty may not quite understand, perhaps, and may have a bit of an inferiority complex if they're an R1 but not a top-flight R1. I wish you all the best in a very tough market.  OP) Thanks! I'm currently postdocing at a major R1, and the candidates they picked for the last search here confirmed to me that truly anyone could end up anywhere!  7) to #6.  Yes, they have learned how to masquerade productivity by slopping anyone's name in the lab on a paper and pretending they contributed to inflate publication numbers.  That is the biggest PROBLEM.  That said, if someone graduates with zero pubs and no teaching experience, they ARE NOT more qualified NOR are they more competitive in a real market.  We just have a non-real market where people hire folks whose buddy recommended them.  I've seen it too often to pretend its not real. 8) Phone interviewed at Northwest Missouri State U last year.  before I got a word out edgewise, somebody in the room shouts out ""THIS IS A TEACHING SCHOOL NOT A RESEARCH UNIVERSITY.""  it was followed by a series of laughs.  This was vert bio.  Nothing in my portfolio indicated I was not aware of where I was applying, and I was clear that thsi was the kind of school I thought would be great.  Overall, who wants to work with peole like that anyway?  Still, it was amazingly rude and uncalled for.  The person they hired had minimal qualifications compared to most people I know who applied. 9) Had a similar thing happen a few years ago at a different university. Pedagog was incredibly rude on the phone. She pretty much countered everything I said with, ""that's not the way I would do it, but I'm a real teacher."" What's funny is that you could tell some of the other faculty in the interview were embarrassed by her behavior and tried to downplay her comments. Anyways, I turned down the campus interview when called just b/c I didn't want to meet the pedagog. 9) It is interesting. I can why an SLAC would be worried about hiring someone who was primarily interested in research. The candidate would likely not be happy at that type of institution. However, I wonder how often it happens that they hire someone with too much research experience and they end up hating their job as they don't really like dealing with undergrads. 10) I was invited for an interview recently after already accepting another position. I wrote back to the SC that this was the case, and the response was basically ""Congrats! We already figured you were going to get better offers and weren't sure if we should invite you in the first place."" Ooookkkkk? Anyway, seems to indicate that SCs do have doubts about interviewing people who seem overqualified and might decide not to invite for this reason. :/  OP) The original situation here is not a research scientist applying to a SLAC. This is a research scientist with a solid CV applying to a bunch of R1 schools. The problem seems to be that the biggest schools shortlist me but then I just miss out on interviews, while most of the less big R1s don't shortlist me at all.  When I saw that those schools often ended up interviewing people similar to me but with considerably lower qualifications, I was chalking it up to them probably having great contacts in that university. But now that at least one of these schools is admitting to concerns about me being overqualified, I have to wonder how often that has occurred.  If that is true, what is the solution? I can't just state in my cover letter, ""... and I swear I don't think I'm too good for your university"", just in case they are concerned. Then if they weren't concerned in the first place, I would come across as an asshole.  11) Yeah, I've had similar things happen to me as the OP. Pretty much everyone I know with a similar CV to me already has a TT position, while I am in the doldrums of a 4th post-doc. Part of it is just bad luck, partly research specializiaton (my research intersts have been very broad), and maybe other shit that I don't see, but yeah, I don't know what you can do to convince someone that you are serious or not. 12) just remember, lazy people don't want productive people around stirring the pot any more than productive people want lazy folks around slowing progress. 13) What is funny is to look at the comments on the University of Dayton job. I guess the department got a bunch of good applicants. Their first choice turned them down. Commentors then made fun of the dept for setting their expectations too high. You just can't please everyone on this forum.; 14) As the  candidate who declined Dayton, I'd express that it was a great department, with great resources, and tremendous opportunity for growth and success. It was as advertised and was a great fit professionally and personally (near family). I happened to have the good fortune to receive an offer from another institution that was even closer to family, and which aligned a little better with my current research program. Had this offer not come through, I'd happily be shopping for a house in Dayton this weekend. I think Dayton played their cards perfectly (easy for me to say, I know). I think I have a relatively strong CV with regards to publications, grants, and teaching, but I was never once short-listed for any of the R1 Ecology faculty positions I applied for. In short, I'm not competetive on the R1 ecology landscape, and I think Dayton correctly identified this.  15) well, I've been interviewed at three R1s (2 AAU schools), a multitude of M1s and 1 SLAC.  They skipped me over.  Meanwhile, a person I know with a virtually identical publication record, and fewer grants, just got hired as Chair of a doctoral department.  I have no doubt that the candidates interviewed at Dayon were good.  But, I also know that there are a ton of people who don't want a challenge.  I am the one who posted the above comment about laziness.  Because there are lazy people in some schools does not mean that Dayton is loaded with lazy people.  Savy?  ","Dear Search Chair, you seem to have trouble drafting that rejection email.  Let me help you.   ""Dear Applicant: We appreciate you coming for an interview in our search for an Assistant Professor.  We have made an offer to another candidate, but wish you the best in your search for a faculty position.  Sincerely, Weak Assed Search Chair Who Can't Send a Damned Rejection Email.""   Now copy and paste that into an email and hit send.  1) oh my gosh, ditto! (x4) 2) I say name names here. How often does professional courtesy of the peer-review process look good in comparison? 3) SO true. Ugh. 4) This is why I'm so grateful to this Google doc and everyone on here!!  5) SC member here, I do get where you're coming from, but this email is Not Allowed at our R1!!  (nor was the anonymous email I sent to a candidate telling them that letter #3 had to be in by date X for them to not be dropped from our search). We are only allowed to contact rejected candidates with official information after the offer has been accepted, and that can take months. Rules. Ugh! 6) Thanks for the insight!","Job wiki for next year? Does anyone know when the job postings for this year end and start for next year? I am assuming this ends soon and then will restart in the summer. Whoever does this amazing wiki, please post the website link here so we can all find it! Thanks! 2) It's kind of grey.  I would say that most people are done applying for this season, but I still have two more job apps due.  Usually the first ones for the next round aren't due until Sept. (occasionally Aug.) 3) I'm starting to see some applications for next year (5/23/16).","Welp. That looks like the end of my application season. To everyone who was successful: congrats. To everyone else: see ya’ll next year :( 2) I think I'm going to be here next year too - I have one remaining opportunity left, and the waiting is torture. I have no sense for predicting how things went, either. 3) Fuck it, dude, let's go bowling. 4) 17 applications with 1 on-campus and no offer....this sucks with no end in site. 5) After several years on the academic job market, I ended up accepting a job in industry. It's hard to feel like a leak from the pipe, but the idea of having a 9-5 job that allows me to do science and have a life is pretty exciting. It's also a relief to not have to try to get tenure in the Trump funding environment. 6) @5, out of curiosity, what was your academic specialty and what is the industry where you found a position?  7)  Job season 4 or 5 is done for me too.  I'm happy to have a tenured position given how rough the job market is, but have been looking to relocate for years now and just cannot pull it off despite a lot of grant money, presentations, teaching awards, pubs, etc.  I think I put in about 6 job applications this year all for open rank, endowed chair, or dept. chair positions.  Landed two phone interviews.  One back in January that seems to have gone no where in 3 months and one last week that resulted in an e-mail today telling me that I'm out.  I suck so bad at phone interviews.  I've not gotten any other official rejection letters as of yet, but I'm not holding my breath.  Time to just get back to being productive.  Will try again next year.  Fuck me and fuck us all.  8) This is @5 answering @6 - I focused on Ag related industry positions. There tends to be more $ in Ag than in ecology, especially now. I've had molecular ecology/micro friends go into biomed industry since they mostly want molecular skills & problem solving. I turned down a job that was in a different subfield than my specialty but I know enough about the general topic to make it work. ",Importance of TT 2,NA,ecoevojobs.net link Not sure if this is what the previous comment refers to -- but is it possible to redirect ecoevojobs.net to the new 2018-2019 job listing rather than this one? Or is it a different person maintaining the new sheet? 2) The Faculty jobs on the new sheet seems to be uneditable (10/05/18),"I interviewed for job in late November. They said they would have a decision made before Christmas, and I never heard that I didn't get the job. It's pretty obvious that I didn't, and I've moved on. But that seems really unprofessional. Part of me wants to reach out and see why they never told me I didn't get it. Should I just forget about it? 2) It seems pretty lame not to even let you know after an on campus. I don't think you have much to gain by reaching out though when you aren't likely to gain anything from the answer, unless you're fishing for an apology. 3) At this point, I don't see a lot of point in contacting them 4) same happened to me last year, I still feel very bitter about them not letting me know I didn't get it and I agree, it is extremely unprofessional and just disrespectful in general 5.) Happened to me twice this round, I found out later on this Wiki. Even a form email from HR would be nice...5) WOW, that seems so unprofessional, I would normally just assume that they were taking forever with the decision and hold out hope :( 6) I had a pretty incredible ghosting experience. I was flown out for an on-site interview, and at the end the chair said they would continue to communicate with me about the process and final decisions. That was February 2018. I never heard from anyone at the university again. Out of curiosity I checked the department website at some point last Fall (remembering - didn't I interview for something?), and they did hire somebody for the position. I was pretty blown away by how disposable I was as a candidate, and the general lack of professional courtesy. 7) This has happened to me, and I've heard the same from others in my professional circle. I think it's more common than you might expect. 8.) Agreed, I have been ghosted by three of my on-campus interviews this year. I have basically gone with ""I didn't get it"" as a default based on these experiences, makes applying that much more fun. 9) Super common. My default is to assume no one will every respond 10) One other explanation is that you made a post-interview cut but weren't their top choice, so they were holding onto you until the ink was dried on the final offer letter, in case their preferred candidates fell through at some point during negotiation or the official approval.  11) #10 is almost certainly correct.  This is the reason they don't inform you immediately.  In the case that you don't get informed at all, my guess is that this is just disorganization not intentional discourtesy.  (I.e., committee members probably assume the search committee chair is going to do it; the search committee chair may assume the department chair is going to do it; the department chair may assume the search committee chair or HR is going to do it; etc.)  I guess if you are ever on a hiring committee, you should make sure that someone is officially charged with letting the unsuccessful applicants know.","interviews with deans I've found lots of advice on preparing for interviews with faculty and for delivering a good job talk, but I'm unable to find much on what to expect to discuss during one-on-one interviews with deans at an R1 for a TT position. For my on campus interview, I'm scheduled to meet with the deans of two colleges (joint appointment) and the dean of grad studies. What has been your experience?  2) They do almost all the talking in my experience- they're trying to sell you on the place. They answered my questions but didn't really ask any of me, and sometimes I couldn't get a word in edgeways. This was at 2 different R1s 3) Congratz! Agreed with #2. All my on-campus interviews Deans/Associates would do all the talking, they initially might ask you to introduce yourself, but my advise not oversell yourself at that point, and let him/her talk. They obviously would ask if you have any questions, and you should ask one or, two. Good luck! 4) Deans probably vary a lot in terms of what they might talk to you about, but I agree that they all are likely to talk a lot. For me, my meeting with the dean was pretty unremarkable, but I felt it was good I met him, because my offer and all negoatiations had to go through him 5) I had a situation where they were asking me about programs that I could create. Seems as if the college was in a transitionary period and was looking for high impact program ideas. I did not get the job.  6) I agree with others who say that the bigwigs do most of the asking and most of the talking during those meetings with the Dean, VP Academic, etc.  Now that I am faculty and I know how hiring processes work (at least at my university), I wouldn't worry about them too much about those interviews, to be honest.  Unless you make a really bad impression, the Dean (etc.) is very likely to approve whichever candidate the department selects.  Worry more about getting the hiring committee on your side.... +1 7) OP here reporting back on my experience after meeting with 3 deans and each was different. The first was tough because they had almost nothing to share and was merely there to answer my questions which caught me off guard. The second did all of the talking, mostly informative about what resources are available for faculty and I couldn't get a word in at all. The third asked me several challenging questions about my field just to hear my response and how I felt I would fit in with the college. Overall though I agree with #6 that these bigwigs have little, if any, say in who is chosen. In fact, the first dean came right out and said ""I don't report back to anyone so we can have a relaxing conversation, don't worry""   8) My Qs:  Are there any areas of emphasis where the dean's office is hoping to build in the future?  Have you pursued cluster hires on any particular topics in the past?   What infrastructure/seed grants has the Dean's office offered recently?   Is there grant submission support from the college or is that handled by the departments?  Are there any major curriculum changes that the dean's office is hoping to implement?   What measures has the dean taken to incentivize research or teaching?   How does bridge funding work if needed?   ","How many of us have ended relationships over moving for jobs? Why is this so hard? Why do we have to choose? 2) Yes, twice. Don't want to do it again. And current partner is not in academia, so it's not like I could negotiate a position for them either. 3) I had to choose between a TT job and a multi year relationship. I chose myself and the job and as a woman, feel like I'm being punished for choosing my career 4) Would it somehow be different if you were nb or a man? 3) Who is punishing you? 4) FYI I negotiated a job for a non-ac spouse, though they were still a fit for certain campus positions. You can have non-ac spousal hires! 5) Sorry, stupid question: what is 'ac'? 6) academic 7) #4 again. This obviously won't help everyone, but think carefully about your partners skills- finance, events, engineering, marketing, non-profit work, HR... universities are basically small cities and they might have more positions that you realise that can be co-opted for a partner. I made it really clear that this was an important issue for me on my hiring. It wasn't written into my contract, but I brought it up more than once with my chair and the relocation person assigned to me. I asked for introductions to the relevant division on campus. And it worked! ","How long should you wait to send a write a follow-up email after no response? I got a job offer to my dream position a few months ago (YAY!). After this they asked me for more information about what I would need as well as to comment on the offer, which I provided. They told me they would get back to me soon and that they are still fully committed to the offer despite the ongoing Covid crisis. This was now than two months ago and I am starting to be a bit stressed that I lose the offer or that an email got lost. Many people told me that I should send them an email, but I don't want to stress them more in this difficult time and/or sound pushy or desperate. Any advice? 2) Send polite email just asking for any update. Keep the communication channel open. 3) I know your feeling. But 2 months is too long. You have to either call them, or, email them now to check on everything. You have a right to know. 4) Thanks for your advice guys! I send them an email and it turned out the email they wanted to send me (actually weeks ago) was stuck in the outbox! Problem solved and really good that I contacted them. Lesson learned. "
"offer after rejection Has anyone ever received an offer after receiving a rejection letter? (e.g. 1st offer to candidate is declined) Does this ever happen? (1) In my experience on several SCs at a public institution, we send rejection letters to only the folks who are not on the short list or a backup ""longer list"" that we may call up if one or more of the short listers fails to wow. If we go through both the short and long list, the search ""fails"". Most lists had 5 short-listers and 5 more that we kept just-in-case. I'd be interested to hear if private universities have more latitude. (2) @1, since you are obviously faculty and on SCs, I'm sure it's only a matter of time before someone on here calls you names and angrily tells you to stop trolling our wiki (even though we all hope to be you someday). But, before that happens, I wanted to say thanks for your constructive input. (3) @2, I didn't know that there were rules about who can be on this wiki, and I think it's nice that SCs will update the information honestly from the inside! (4) @3 2 here.  I totally agree with every word you said, but I've read many times where people get viciously aggressive with those who aren't ""one of us.""

I'm impressed by the candidates this year. Since I've now been on both sides of the search, I think it would be helpful to mention a few observations about the applications- some are petty but as an SC member I notice them. I hope this is helpful. Please add... 1.""broadly trained ecologist"" and ""ideal fit for this position"" are overused. 2. .pdf is preferred, and carefully name your files. We have 4 or more files for each candidate and it is difficult to sort through them. 3. Pester your LOR writers- I wonder how serious applicants are about position if they can't follow through with their letter writers. 4. Google yourself and make sure your facebook page and any other personal info isn't public (NOTE: SC members shouldn't be snooping around your personal life, but they might come across things if they search your lab page, press releases, etc.). 5. Keep your cover letter ~ 1 page. 6. Please don't list all 20 of your invited/conference presentations. We look at positions, pubs, teaching experience and grants. Do include grants you wrote but aren't PI on (even those in review).7. Organize your CV with the most relevant info first. We do not read all 20 pages that list all talks, posters, mentored undergrads, and TA positions. We want to see Who you are, where you came from (academically) [do list your advisers as that can go a long way], how many papers and where they are published (if any have media attention other than your local newspaper highlight that), teaching experience, other than TA, and grants written and funded. WE want to see you are applying for grants, not just listing those you get. Remember that if its a primarily research position, list papers and grants first, if teaching, list teaching and papers first. 8. show us you have a vision of your research and teaching- list where you will apply for funding, which classes you might teach, how grad & undergrad students fit into your lab,and who (faculty or department) at the U you might collaborate/co-teach with. Regarding point 4, isn't it inappropriate for members of a selection committee to be googling applicants and altering their decision on job candidates based on aspects of their non-work life? Re:Good point! As an SC member I google people if looking for their webpage, press releases, etc.This was more of a concern I had as a previous candidate, not an SC member.   Re: Rightyo.  Honestly I assume that everyone does it, but knows that they're not really SUPPOSED to. Suggestion regarding point 1: Maybe job ads should stop reading, ""We are searching for a broadly-trained ecologist....""",Post interview waiting  I've interviewed at a few schools over the last year and have had at least a minimum of 2 months before they made decisions. The anticipation has been overwhelming at times and slowed my general productivity. Anyone else have this issue? Even my PI and other professors are puzzled by my experiences. ,"Anyone who has been on and/or watching the job market for the last few years notice a rise in “term limited appointments”? None are listed as tenure track and many say explicitly say extensions are not possible. Is this just a rebranding of the visiting professor or adjunct positions? I would say, on the whole, both are considered rather poor choices – so are these “term-limited” jobs just the same thing in a different package? The job specifics seem to be pretty close (such as teaching 4-6 courses a year). I just don’t see the point in institutions advertising these any more than I do visiting-professor/adjunct/sessional… 1) I have noticed an increase in the number of part-time positions advertised, but I kinda suspect that is partly because a lot of those vacancies did not used to be nationally advertised.  I have not noticed any more temps than any other year so far.  However, I have noticed an increase in non-tenure track (supposedly permanent) lecturer/prof of practice positions.  But, I never used to pay any attention to them. ","Make PDFs of application materials, don't submit word files. x2. 2) Just shit canned several promising applicants because they submitted a word docs for cover letters and CVs. When your trying to make a short list of many qualified and wondeful ecologist, the little things become very important. 3) ...like your grammar? Jesus fucking christ. 4) Holy shit, I agree Word is a pain, but to reject promising applicants because they used it, that seems like an asshole move. 5) I didn't get it, why rejecting them because of using Word?? 6) I always use PDFs so nothing changes in the uploading/emailing process. However, I find it very sad that we can all spend so many hours, days, and weeks of our lives putting together applications just so they can be discarded by someone who doesn't like the document type. If you said PDFs only in your job ad, then cool. But if you didn't, then don't be a dick about it.","Additional Tabs Why do searches fail?  Is the only reason because they could  not find a person who they want to hire?  Or are there other reasons?  Could a search be called ""failed"" if, for example, the position was withdrawn? 2) I think it is most commonly because of lack of agreement regarding the top choice (rockstar postdoc gets four offers, accepts one, and the three other searches fail because no one could agree on who was the second-best candidate). I've seen them fail because different factions existed and couldn't agree, even without extending an offer. 3) They can also fail because a set of candidates can look great on paper and then be generally disappointing for any number of reasons in person. There are a lot of reasons for failed searches and all of them are frustrating for everyone involved. For every available job there are some or many people who would be great, but the process of getting from position announcement to new hire is all too often a clusterfuck that lets solid candidates slip through the cracks at many points along the way. With the current giant pool of diverse and impressive candidates there should be no excuse for any search failing, but get used to seeing several of them every year. 3) I can only comment on my personal experiences at my university. Every failed search I have been apart of was b/c of top candidates turning down the position and candidates futher down the ladder being viewed as not acceptable.  4) Faculty in department have too high a set of standards for the institution where they work or Dean refuses to hire who faculty want, or faculty fight too much.  80% of the time if there is a failed search, its because the place is screwed up and all the candidates turned it down, but faculty are unable (due to rules) or too high on themselves to go deeper into the pool.  My experience is that there is little difference between the top 5-10 candidates.  In this job market, I dont see how anyone can have a failed searh except due to budgets.  7) A combination of the above factors combined with timing can be an issue...candidate #1 takes a long time to make up their mind, ultimately turns down the offer, then by the time offer is made to #2 they have already accepted another position.  4) #5, you want to believe on 10% are worthy, that is your right.  I've seen the CVs of people at R1s.  The difference between about 1/2 of r1 faculty and those found in other levels is not talent or knowledge, its opportunity after getting the job.  There are not that many R1s in the country,and of those, only a fraction are the stature of U of Michigan anyway.  So even if only 10% are worthy, that is still 30 candidates, and there probably will not be 30 openings in that specific description in a two-five year period.  If only 10% at your small university are worthy, you have too high a standard.  I can say this because I've worked at both good and bad schools and sat on search committees at both.  There are more than 10%, closer to half, now that is field dependent.  The fact is that a ton of the best wont even apply at your little school, and a ton of others won't because they are shooting for higher spots.  Now, if you are looking for teaching experience SPECIFICALLY, then your dept might drop that down.  But, most applicants have little to none anyway.  Most small schools boil down to working on committees and teaching, some consider research productivity important.  Now that I think about your statement, I realized something.  Saying they ""are not worthy"" could mean anything.  You are not saying their teaching or researhc or service experience is insufficient.  Worthy?  It could mean as little as, my buddy didn't provide 90% of these folks a reference.  I hate to admit it, but in most small schools, the connections are more important than anything else.  Stack a guy with a solid teaching and research record against mr. new grad with no experience, tack on a reference from a good budy of the search committee and viola, the never-done-nothing is hired.  It happens all the time, I've seen it where I've worked. 6)  All anyone does on here is fight. There are so many arrogant assholes on here it's amazing.  Why is there a fight here.  Job searches go down one way at one place and another way at a different place.  So the fuck what?  Thanks for both of you for sharing your experiences, but can we respect each other just a tad bit more.  There is so much petty bickering on this site it's sickening.  You know what they say about opinions, right?  They're like assholes. Everybody's got one and everyone thinks everyone else's stinks. Sorry 6. I deleted my comment.   7) actually #6, you missed the point. There is a difference between saying we want someone who has a distinguished teaching record, and saying 90% of applicants are not worthy.  One sets a high standard with somewhat of a quantitative meaninful, and non-insulting presentation.  The other is an insult to most of us on here, and posted by someone who has a superiority complex far beyond their own mastry or attainment.  That was the issue.  Sure, part of it was a disagreement.  The insulting belittlement of others is what I was addressing. #7) I'm just going to delete all my comments. Sorry I offended you or anyone else. I thought some people just might want an example of how all failed searches are not created equal. You are completely worthy. I don't want to get in an argument with anyone on here. In another week or so the last job I'm holding out for will be off the boards and I don't want to leave on bad terms when I will most likely be on here next year. 8) (just because I'm entertained by how irrational people get when the fire is stoked) It is hilarious that #6 addressed the problem of being ""insulting and belittling"" by telling #7 they have a ""superiority complex far beyond their own mastry or attainment.""  Pot, meet kettle.  7) to #8, I was thinking the same thing. :)  I'm embarrassed to be involved in this exchange. ","I was about to give up on academia, and applied to an industry job. Had an interview and the interviewer was like - ""Umm. We think you're great, but you'll be bored here. Better stay in academia."" Wtf. 2) I've had faculty at R1s tell me the same thing about their institution - 'you don't want to be here, we suck'  3) Why all the negativity by these people!? 3) #2 here, when I hear things like this, my impression is that some people have an interest in being negative, either they may want the institution, search or application of certain candidates to not proceed, if fail completely. (1) here - I'm still in limbo. Year 5 of postdoc...","Continuing H1B visa status I haven't seen much/any conversation about non US citizens applying to jobs, and wishing to continue their visa status. Any good pointers on timelines for applying for extensions, negotiations with Universities to prevent latent periods between visa status updates, and negotiating immigration status change with Universities? 1) Instruction for H1B procedure is stated in my offer letter. I never brought up H1B during negotiation since I still have enough time left","Is it just me or does anyone else find it odd when it becomes clear post interview that a search committee is looking for someone to collaborate on their current project, i.e., analyze their data, and hopefully help them land a big grant? I mean, in a normal world, I would think that search committees should be choosing the candidate with the strongest chance of a lifetime career, not assistance with narrow topic currently being worked on. It's happened to me several times - if they wanted collaboration, maybe they should have said so during the interview. I might be a bit reserved, but a research program is somewhat of a private enterprise, so as a general rule I don't leep forward into expressing an exhorbitant amount of enthusiasm about someone else's work, lest it appear that I have sticky fingers or don't have anything better to work on than someone else's ideas. 2) Usually they wait until you arrive before they ask you to write their grants for them.  Esp with new PI status you could be seen as the golden goose.  For now, play nice and say that's a really interesting idea and you'd love to talk more if you get the offer.  You aren't committed until you start running experiments for them.  For now, view it as a compliment and hope you get an offer. 3) No, it's the other way around, when the offer goes to someone who evidently will be working on proposals with the search committee. 4) There is no alturism here. Trying to nurture you into your own private enterprise while they have nothing to gain? They will choose the candidate who can collaborate with them or contribute to their program.5)  Have been on many SCs and we often look for someone that has the greatest ability to collaborate with pre-existing faculty/research programs, although that is not always the deciding factor.  ...especially if you are an a-hole.  For the OP, I'd suggest you do get excited about hearing about what they have to say about their research or you may be classified as anti-social and a bit of an arrogant dick. 6) <-- LOL. That was my first thought about the OP. 7) Most of the jobs I've applied for are explicitly about collaboration, and they have asked me to address either in application materials or at the interview stage the question of who I'd be collaborating with and how. A collaborative attitude is essential. (Maybe not if you are in theoretical ecology?) 8) OP here - it's not collaboration if it's a one-way street.  During the interviews we do talk about research. However, conversation about biology of their system goes cold quickly if we go beyond methods. Having 2 active NSF grants (and a third expired one), I can tell you that tools alone won't get you that grant. You need intellectual questions and interests. Tools aren't enough. Of course,  I'm older but am wondering if the job market has changed a bit so that most people getting jobs I've applied for are expected to do the boring part of a project - the labor but not intellectual development necessarily. It's like another postdoc. 9) Oh come on... It's like another postdoc except that you have the security of a permanent job. 10) Is there a grain of truth in OPs' thoughts though? I wonder as I have seen a number of candidates recently with amazing ideas getting passed over for candidates with specific skill sets...11) I think there is some truth to it - there are searches that do look for a collaborator. I suppose that's fine but that can be a problem for the candidate because they may also be expected to have their own research program. moreover, if someone is listed as a co-PI on a NSF grant, it will be difficult to get another grant from that same program, even though it may be required for tenure.  The new faculty member will have also wasted their 'new investigator' classification and whatever bump it may offer in the awarding stage. My provost calculates how much each individual tenure track faculty brings in. If the grant has 4 PIs on it, the total amount is divided by 4 and thus would count less than the person who is sole PI on a similar sized grant. If you ask me, it's horrible to bring in a new faculty member as a tool -- collaborations may come and go -- and faculty come and go - so it would be best to hire someone who can stand alone in the department. It would strengthen the department and reduce competition from within the department. Of course, collaboration within the department is great, but the awards get dilluted and benefit very few when it comes down to it. My take on it is, if you have a great idea and need someone with XXX skills, write the proposal, get the grant and hire a postdoc. In case you haven't noticed, there are a lot of postdocs out there. 12) a lot of postdocs out here and all suffering because of the lack of academic jobs...and the vicious cycle continues. 13) Take the tenure-track postdoc already! x3  13) Tenure==Freedom. 14) No. You should learn what tenure really means. It means you can't get fired for arbitrary political reasons. You can get fired, for example, if you don't show up for work. 15) I've been pondering this for days @14. Are you saying that being required to show up for work means you aren't free?? 16) ""No one is free, even birds are chained to the sky.""","Pumping at an on-campus interview? Hi all, I will be going to an on-campus interview(s) and will need to pump at least twice during the day. If I don't do this, there will be some obvious negative (and embarrassing) consequences. Does anyone have any advice as to how to broach this with the search committee? I don't want this to affect my interview, but it is necessary for me to do so. 2) i was told that one should be very straightforward and early about needing breaks for pumping but hopefully there is an assistant/secretary who is dealing with setting your itinerary and you can avoid telling this straight to the chair ...Good luck at the interviews!! 3) I just did this, actually. The secretary was nice about scheduling the break each day and gave me my own little testing room to have available to me. However, I'm not sure how the info spread, but my host picking me up emailed to assure me that there was room in her car for the accompanying husband and baby (who were NOT accompanying and never mentioned). She was cool about it, and didn't seem judgemental, but it was a little weird. And I don't know if it was a negative that it was clear that I had a family accociated. It's been 3 weeks since the interview so I assume they picked another candidate. No way to know if all of that affected the decision or not (other two were 1 male and 1 female with no family). 4) I did this at several interviews this year. Be very direct with whomever is scheduling your interviews (admin, chair if you have to) and detail your needs. Don't apologize for the fact that you need to do this! My emails looked something like ""I will need to pump breastmilk while I am there. To do this I will require x many 20 minute breaks every 3-4 hours, with access to a private room that has an electrical outlet"". Be specific because not everyone knows about the mechanics/logistics of pumping! I carried my pump/cooler around with me and left it whoever's office was volunteered. It's definitely scary to out yourself as a breeding female, but try not to worry about it. For what it's worth, I got two offers from places where the chair and probably the whole committee knew I was pumping during my time there. Best of luck mama! 5) THANK YOU all so much! I contacted the chairs and both were very understanding. We will see how it goes!","For at least the third year in a row, my uni has done a 'diversity hire' (where gender was a key factor in the deliberations) for a white woman from a middle-class background with no kids and a trailing spouse. Hiring based on gender is also illegal in the state, and of course the uni is also still doing way too little about key barriers like parental leave and childcare access, and cracking down on sexual harassment. But this is what happens when people assume gender ratios are the only good measure of equity. Good luck out there dudes (and anyone who faces real barriers)! 2) srsly.... 3) Holy rant, batman. Maybe you do know this woman's background, but it seems strange that you would know anything about her family background and how she was raised. White dudes of the US, you will be fine. Gender parity can be an important metric, though of course not the only one. The previously reported 60/40 female/male hire ratio from last year seems to say... well, that it's not terribly skewed, and without info on PhD graduation rates and application sex ratios for all the jobs out there, it's hard to know if this actually represents anything but equity. You may disagree with the reasoning behind the choices your institution is making, but your disagreement is not evidence of overall bias, especially not against ""dudes"" out there. x6 4) There is good data on gender ratio of current Ecology PhD graduates (cited on this page more than once), and it is roughly inline with the hire ratio reported by J. Fox (also cited on this page). 5) Agree that OP's tone here is unhelpful. That said, I'm a little surprised at the extent to which people--often the same people who advocate for affirmative action--deny that affirmative action is happening. In OP's anecdote (assuming it's true), they said gender *was a key factor in deliberations*, i.e. they know for a fact gender was decisive in these cases. So saying that the ratio of PhDs is about the same as the ratio of new hires is totally orthogonal to OP's argument. For the record though, the ratio of Ph.D.s (female/male) is about 50% whereas the hires are about 60%. Bolnick and others commenting on Fox's blog post anecdotally estimated the ratio of applicants in searches they've seen to be ~35%, which would make the average success rate of women twice that of men. Who knows if Bolnick has it right, but: (a) given that women face unique barriers and also make different choices, it makes sense that they apply in lower numbers than the # of PhDs (isn't that one of the things we're trying to fix?), and (b) the 2:1 advantage for female applicants over males (at the faculty level) would be broadly consistent with other empirical evidence from across STEM (e.g., see here: http://theconversation.com/men-and-women-biased-about-studies-of-stem-gender-bias-in-opposite-directions-48924). Finally, there's the fact that every job ad in North America these days has an affirmative action statement, and many, if not most, universities have explicit policies saying that, if the top two candidates are not significantly apart in their qualifications and one is from an underrepresented group, the hire has to be the UR person. All this to say, it doesn't make sense to argue that women don't have an advantage in faculty hiring, once they get there (the fact that they often have a disadvantage before they do is the reason they are given an advantage, right?). IMO, it also does a disservice to UR folks to deny this, because they hear all the bad news about the barriers they face and none of the good news about things unis are doing to address it. This is probably pretty discouraging (I've seen this). So let's stop wasting time debating whether or not affirmative action exists in faculty hiring--it definitely does. Let's instead discuss on what scale is best--on balance--to do AA, and what to base it on (specific barriers, numbers, etc.). That seems like a constructive conversation everyone can contribute to.   6) Where are you getting 50% of PhDs in EEB? 7) You must publish exclusively in the journal Anecdota. 8) @6 the PhD numbers are also cited in Fox's blog, the same one that cites the 60% of hires. @7..and you publish in the journal Motivated Reasoning and Dogma? Seriously though, help me understand your position. Are you arguing that affirmative action doesn't happen? Which part of @5's comment is inaccurate, and what's the countervailing evidence? 9) Diversity initiatives/conversations are dominated by white feminism. People of color are f*cked in this field, to the degree that they aren't even in people's minds for these conversations (or Fox's blog, for that matter). As long as the main criteria for hires is ""potential"", we'll be stuck hiring people that look like the current faculty bodies (i.e., white). 10) That wasn't the case in my last department, which just made an offer to a South Asian woman and tried to get an African American woman. This was done to balance a seriously off kilter department, but it's all a little box-tick-ish given the departmental culture. I've been asked ""accidentally"" sexist interview questions at a place that claimed to be trying to hire more women (yet somehow they only managed to interview one), so I wouldn't put too much stock into affirmative action statements in individual cases. IMO, people still have problems evaluating candidates belonging to different groups objectively. I've seen numerous cases where people thought they could lowball an URM and were surprised when they had multiple offers. Anecdotally, I didn't find being told that I should have it easier because everyone is ""politically correct"" these days encouraging. At all. x1 11) There are a lot of troubling things about OP's original comments. I agree with much of what #5 has to say - no denying affirmative action. How to hire in the best way is a great conversation to have, and has been touched on in many other threads. However, the casual sexism in the original comment is seriously troubling to me - assumption of a ""middle-class background"" for the woman as if this precludes any prior struggle; the note of ""good luck"" to the ""dudes"" as if women are stealing their jobs; the comment about ""anyone who faces real barrers"" as if women haven't systematically faced enormous barriers for... well, choose your prefered time frame. As others have noted, equality starts to look a lot like discrimination to those who were previously favored. #5 makes the interesting point that our current hiring system may not be equal, per se, but this 60/40 hiring ratio is a pretty recent phenomenon. For those poor white dudes who think they have lower R1 prospects now, think about the many societal boosts you got during infancy, grade school, undergrad, grad school, etc, and how those were denied to your female peers. What does equality look like now? Does equality only focus on the one part of life where you suddenly don't have an advantage any more, or does equality even out across all aspects of life? 12) Women are more likely to gradutae HS, recieve the majority of university degrees, and have higher acceptance rates to graduate school. I'm sorry you seem to have a tenuous control of the statistical realities...and I'm not even white, or a male. 13) Of course, this is after they've been taught to sit still and do as they're told by society. This isn't some evil bias against men. They already behave, on average, differently at that stage, and it's nothing to do with essentialism. 14) @13 it's actually more complicated than that. Boys and girls, on average, learn slightly differently, and there is evidence K-12 and increasingly uni tilt towards girls. There are also tons of resources to support girls in areas they on average struggle with more or are underrepresented in but no resources for the converse cases. Here is an old summary that probably applies doubly today: https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2000/05/the-war-against-boys/304659/. Also, here is some new evidence of the scale of AA in academic hiring: http://nationalpost.com/opinion/turns-out-there-is-discrimination-in-hiring-professors-but-not-against-minorities 15) Wow, way to cite a non-biased source there.","Fresh start Ready for those 2018-19 job postings-- ready, set, go! https://tinyurl.com/yaxm7kjl  2) thank you! is it the same person who maintains these things? 3) I set up the new year, but am not this year's maintainer-- I'd be happy to add others as moderators!

Asked for a few extra days to submit start-up and did not get a response until less than 48 h before the last day of the extension I requested. The email was super-hostile and opened with ""Just a reminder that we need your startup within 24h or we are moving on""; not a professionalway to communicate with someone you want to hire. The . email then proceeded to outline exactyly the amount of money I would get and the rigid structure that it had to be framed in ($xx for equipment, $xx for students, etc.). So I had <48 h to completely rework my start-up to meet uni demands - why not state these specifics up front!?!? So I reworked the startup, asked for a bit more salary, a temporory lab tech job for spouse, and to reallocate some equipment cash to bump up my relocation funds. Heard back in less than 1 hour with a ""sorry we cannot accomodate your requests""; no counter offers, nothing. Needless to say I backed out and declined the position. This was SO FRUSTRATING because the campus visit and interview were excellent. If any uni admins are reading this: a) if you are not actually going to negotiate then don't create a facade of negotiations, it's a waste of time; b) think about the tone of an e-mail before you hit send; and c) if you have a rigid structure in your start-up, tell the candidate up front! I mean, come on! WTF! 2) Sounds like you dodged a bullet there! 3) Am I getting this right? Your interview and interactions with the department were all great, but the all trouble came from the negotiation with the dean's office (or equivalent)? If so, I'd bet the folks in the department are pretty pissed. Just curious, was this an American research university? Thought they should all be a bit more flexible. 4) Re. 2 - Yep, I feel like I dodged a bullet. Seems weird to decline a TT position in this hiring climate, but so many red flags in such little time. Re. 3 - Yes, was an American R2, which I thought would be at least a little bit flexible. I was reassured that I was unanimously everyone's top pick in the department when . I was offeredthe position, but negotiations (dept. head was intermediate b/w me and Dean, which I thought was strange) were just atrocious. If I was everyone's top pick, I would also think that people in the dept would be pissed. At least I feel confident that I made the right choice by declining.  5)  It's not uncommon for the Dept head to take on negotiation.  It does sound like the dept head either thinks you are moving on to another job or is trying to tank negotiations so they move to a different candidate.  Either way, they are hurting themselves.   I would a) write the search chair and emphasize you are very enthusiastic but confused about negotiations.  Ask for advice, not intervention.  b) Write the dept head and emphasize again your enthusiasm.  Say you are confused abotu some of the negotiation and ask for a phone call.  Repeat as much as you can that you are enthusiastic but need certain resources to have a good chance at NIH/NSF funding   c) Find the prof you had the best interaction with and also ask for their input, even if they aren't on the search committee.    It's possible they can intervene just a little to get you a couple of weeks.   The chair can't usually tank negotiations without any repercussions but they can tank your hire.   If they do, make sure you send an explanation to the search chair.  They probably don't want this either.  x2 6) Agree with number 5. I actually had a candidate contact me once about why they were going to decline an offer. My chair was an ass and wasn't relaying information to the dean, and was not outlining to the dean why the candidate was making the requests. Five minutes later, I was in the dean's office and the candidate received what they asked for and took the job (great candidate, btw). One semester later, our chair was no longer chair. Some chairs think they are full administrators and think they serve administration and not the faculty that appointed them chair. If you are dealing with an administrative head, it's a completely different situation. <--- Good job saving the hire!!!!   7) They already declined. Interesting insights, but it might be a little late to give advice about how to save the negotiation. I'd bet they moved on in a hurry to the next candidate if they had an acceptable one. 8) @7 they posted here, meaning comments on the situation are relevant for others even if not OP. I completely agree with #5 and #6.  Remember that bungled negotiations can be the result of a single asshole-or-idiot.  The chair that hired me was a bit of a doofus about negotions (nothing as bad as OP's story) and a year after I started, he was retired. The general advice is, if something goes screwy with your negotiations, and it's a job you think you want, seek additional perspectives from within the department from folks that seemed rational and level-headed!  If a bunch of people act screwy that's a red flag.  If one does, it might just be them. 9) @8 That's fair enough. But the previous comments could have been construed as advice to the OP go back and see they would reconsider even though he/she declined. Advice for others in similar situation is welcome, but it should problably clearly stated that it is meant generally rather than the specific situation","Negotiations in Canada I know it's normal in the US to use offers from multiple (similarly or higher ranked) schools as negotation leverage, but is this also normal or acceptable in Canada? Whether to negotiate for salary or start up or other things? Wondering if there are any cultural differences I should know about. 2) I tried that once. They told me to take off, then called me a hoser 3) I can't really tell if 2 is joking. 4) Canadian prof here. If you have multiple offers from Canadian institutions you can negotiate more or less as you would in the US.  5) Thanks @4!","Here is a solution to all the people shitposting jobs after the deadline: change the ""add job"" form to not allow deadlines on or after the current date. 2) Now that is a good idea 3) Uh no. Better to have them documented then not at all. 4) Or have them be able to post but not change the update field. 5) Why not? What about the people who do their job, scan all the proper websites for jobs, apply, find out about this page AFTER they apply and want to know about updates? So that person is not allowed to get updates because of a few salty people in here want their work done for them and have every job posted here on time? Laughable. Some lazy folks in here, use the time and energy to scan for job posts outside of here instead of complaining about late posts. 6) @5, honestly I don't care that much, but if someone is posting a job on here to follow updates, they presumably knew about it before the deadline because they applied. The point of a shared resource like this is that everyone contributes and everyone benefits. I think it is pretty reasonable for people to be annoyed when someone posts a job after the deadline. Whether it was the person's intention or not, they are asking for one of the main individual benefits of this resource (updates on jobs) without contributing--at least in that case--to the work of actually helping the group by alerting people to job opportunities when it is still useful. I certainly understand that people might not realize a job wasn't on here until they later go to check for updates, but whether that is true or not I don't think you can argue with the fact that it has the appearance of trying to benefit from the board without contributing to it. x2 7) Hanlon's Razor. Everyone is overwhelmed. Some people find a job and apply, and later on see that it is or is not posted on here. If it's not, maybe then they choose to add it to the board. Seems rather straightforward to me. Not everyone has some secret agenda and strategically posts or doesn't post jobs/updates/whatever to this board. 8) They're only going to get updates if someone else applied without putting it here, and then that same person also has to decide to put an update for someone else's benefit under a job that was added after the deadline. It seems like wasted energy to pursue this too much. At any rate, I'm not convinced it does anything but bring additional stress to an applicant who posts a job after the date and then methodically checks this board to see if they have early knowledge they haven't made the cut... 9) Only academics would crave the addition of non-functionality in a tool such as this spreadsheet. 10) That is why you would never see old posts added to an industry job website, people in industry have the ability to filter signal from noise 11) LMAO this thread is quintessentially academic. One person suggests increasing efficiency and another agrees. A third person disagrees, while a fourth offers a tweak between the agree and disagree groups. The fifth person turns the argument into a class/political debate, while person number six is throwing up their hands and saying ""eh, it is not that big of a deal, but I can see why the efficiency suggestion was made."" Meanwhile, having sat back and taking it all in, person seven suggests that the entire problem can be summed up by an axiom that no one but they have heard of. ""Simply a classic case of [insert axiom name eveyone will google later]"". Person eight valiantly attempts to steer the conversation back to the original issue, but can't help adding their own rehashing of the problem that sounds like new information, but is really a remix of what has already been stated. Person nine, having stewed on this seemingly three-hour discussion (and every other group attempt to alter governance over their 12 years a prof.), turns the spotlight on the process by which all of these people are attempting to solve problems. Person nine thinks ""how can they not see this cycle of overanalysis""? How does this same process happen every single time we try to make the tiniest of changes! While all of this is happening, person 10 drives by in a really nice car and peers in the window. All person ten can think is ""poor bastards."" Having left work at a healthy hour, person ten is on their way home to their family to plan the quarterly vacation. Ten offers a commentary to try and let them know there is a way out, but person ten is not sticking around because they have seen the reality of that room first hand. They know those nine people are in too deep to get out. Ten did their time in that room and moved on. Also, as you might imagine, person ten has a nice house, no student loans, and is the only one that can see academia from the outside. Perhaps most salient, person ten has never had a three hour meeting about anything, much less something as meaningless as changing an internet form. Person ten is in industry. 12) yeah what a silly complaint 13) Most jobs in industry never even appear online. Theyr'e far more word of mouth, who you know type situations. To a far greater extent than academia. 14) #11 - this comment is gold (X3!!!!!!!!!!).  #13 - this is totally untrue from my experience. x3 14) @ 11 Thanks for making me vividly remember the typical faculty meeting :) ","Fall 2020 semester remote vs in person?

I think the continued narrowing of the focus of the typical PhD program has produced people without the proper sense of what is in good taste. 4) I would call. I think they are more comfortable giving out information NOT in writing. Plus in my interviews people always really seem to stress if you have any questions feel free to call me at any time... I think ""call"" being the operative word here.", ,"I definitely do not understand what places are looking for.  I was a PERFECT fit for a place (according to the job ad), and did not even make the first cut. On the other hand, I had what I thought was the WORST phone interview the other day, and they just called for a campus interview!  I'm very happy about that, but I definetly do not understand!  I think I'd feel more confident if I thought I had a clue.  =) 2) I have had this happen as well. It is such a mystery from the candidate's perspective. It can be a crap shoot for sure. That being said phone interviews suck for most people. I have NEVER come away from a phone interview feeling good about it but have gotten most campus interviews after. I have ALWAYS felt great about video interviews. 3) OP: I second absolutely everything you say. 4) just come to terms with it.  Half the schools put together an ad based on what some Dean made them ask for to get the line item approved, but they wanted something esle.  So, they thn weed out all the folks who actually fit the job description and snag the person they really want.  This is why you look aat an ad and just figure if you remotely fit it, you have some chance.  ITs all politics, and you just gotta guess based on teh underlying verbage and the faculty qualificaations already there whether you fit.  ","Age I am very appreciative of everyone who filled in their details on the ""Negotiations"" tab. That said, I don't think those figures are representative. I have been on many interviews (eight total), at both MS-level places and PhD-level places, and I have had offers from two of them. The salaries and startups quoted to me do not at all match the lofty figures posted here. I do not question that the people posting those figures are being honest; I just think they're not representative for some reason (but kudos to them for nabbing such good deals!). 2) I would agree with 1. I have had 2 offers, both a R1 and these are fairly inflated numbers. I suspect people are adding things like ""assitantship values"" to their startups and projecting 12 month salaries from a 9 month. I guess to make themselves feel better? 3) Nah, I'm sure those are real offers. I have friends that have gotten those kind of offers. What's more realistic to me is that people without great offers are more selfconscious about posting their offers; i.e., someone posted a reasonable offer recently and almost immediately someone else posted that the offer was not a good offer; i.e., $56K salary and $20K startup for a public undergraduate institute. That's actually not that bad for that level of university. It seems to me that in general, lower offers in the $50Ks and sub-$50K start-ups are only posted if a candidate declines the offer. 4) Ha, I got a pretty similar offer (same salary and twice that startup) from an R1 in the south last year. It didn’t work out. That was bad for an R1 but anybody who thinks $56K at a public undergrad school is a bad deal needs a reality check. 5) OP and #2, did you post your offers on the page?  Might be helpful to everyone else to see the ranges  6) it would be very helpful if there was more info on the negotiations tab.  I actually suspect I may not have gotten an offer because my start-up request was too high... 7) For anyone that hasn't figured it out yet, smaller, non-research intensive schools routinely negotiate in the mid $50Ks for salary and sub $50Ks for startup. Of course, high cost of living areas are an exception with negotiations ranging in the $70Ks for salary. If a mid-$50K 9-month starting salary is not enough for you, don't apply for non-research intensive/non high-level SLACs, regional state schools with master's programs, or state/private universities with undergrad only programs. R1s and highly reputable SLACs are typically the only universities that are going to throw around numbers in the $70K+ range for salary and start-ups over $150K. Again, there are exceptions. If you don't believe this, try looking at the salaries on the Chronicle of Higher Education link posted below; i.e., median starting salaries for assistant professors in biology at master's level and bachelor's only universities are $54,444 and $55,561, respectively. 8) #6, I've sat on numerous search committees and we typically ask a question about what kind of materials a candidate needs to remain active in research. I am at a university that routinely offers start-ups under $50K, with little movement above that number. Yes, if we ask you that question in a phone interview or on campus and you provide us a number in the $200K range or say you need equipment that costs a ton that we don't already have on campus, that will hurt you going forward. We are a teaching university first, and we want faculty that can do basic research at low cost that stimulates student inquiry; i.e., if you can't do research on our budget, you don't ""fit."" A lot of people have trouble with the word ""fit"" b/c they think of only the subject matter, but a lot of aspects go into ""fit,"" and capability of working under our budgetary constraints is definitely one of those aspects. 9) 50K is a median at schools below the doctoral level.  There are tons of smaller schools and NONE pay over 55K, most pay well under 50.  All you have to do is go to the DOE numbers.  The AAUP numbers on the chronicle are OK, but not as ""dependable.""  IF you are going to a school in the south with fewer than 5K students, EXPECT < 50K and possibly less than 40K.  I cannot speak for the northern states, they SEEM to pay better.  6 again) This was an R1 in the south, but clearly with lower funds than other equivalent schools. 10) #6, I have not had a lot of experience with R1s, but I will say, the handful of friends that I have that received R1 offers all negotiated start-up over $200K. All also negotiated starting salary above $70K (low to mid cost-of-living areas). If I would have been R1 caliber, I would have expected money in at least that range. 11) Most smaller regionals and SLACs have zero start up or start up of a few thousand max. 12) As one of the people who has received multiple offers this year that are on the highest end of the range (and shared them here), I promise you those numbers are real. It's very easy to just call us liars... and I regret even sharing this information in the first place because of these kinds of ""conversations."" 13) Interviewed at an R1. Start-up began at around 400,000. This is a school in the northern US. Salary was high 70s (9 months). This was not necessarily for an expensive (molecular equipment) position. 14) #12, the numbers you provided are great. They will undoubtedly help others with negotiations. Just like any field, there's a big diversity in jobs. You got great job offers. It's not you who needs to come to terms with that, it's the other people who didn't get similar job offers. But to those who didn't, your life is not over. You can still be super productive. 15) I absolutely think that offers on the lower side of the spectrum are not being posted to the Negotiations page. I went on lots of interviews and had multiple offers, so my opinion is based solely on my experience this job season. I second the notion that most regional public undergrad/masters level programs will offer between 30 and 50K for startup, with salary between 50 and 55K. I think non-selective SLACs are similar, but they might go a little higher on startup (but seem to be less flexible on salary). All of this info was added to the Negotiations page, of course. 16) why is the formatting on the negotiations tab such utter crap? I almost didn't add my info","So found out that a postion that I had a phone interview for, a TT faculty in my department is also interviewing for the same job and he/she got shortlisted past the phone interview...I'm a postdoc. Fml. Life is so unfair some times. 2) Happened to me plenty of times this year. Skype-interviewed for jobs that, as I found out later, invited mostly faculty to on-campus interviews. Seems pretty standard these days. 3) Yes, life is unfair. This is a valuable lesson to learn at any time or age, not just these days. It's supposed to be incredibly hard. But I am empathetic of your situation. Everyone is to some extent, but it's how the world works. It's Darwinian. Try not to get too discouraged. You will find suitable employment. 4) I like to put these arguments about why the jobs issue is not so bad in a different context to measure how logically sound they are. Consider advice from someone in one of the rowboats right after the Titanic sunk: ""I don't know what these people in the water are complaining about - I happen to know lots of dry people. In fact, I myself am dry. You in the water there - chin up! Something will come up for you.""  5) I agree with you about the dire situation our field faces with the availability of jobs, but your analogy is a poor one. Although the job market has indeed changed, every member of the professoriate was, at some point, in the water along with everyone else. It should not be difficult to accept that skill, grit, fortitude, etc. probably had less to do with finding a seat in a lifeboat than it does with finding employment (nuances of this needn’t be explored here). Recall an important tenet of evolution by natural selection: many more offspring are produced than can possibly survive. The job market is Darwinian (this is not to say that I like it this way). Any combination of genes, productivity, social networking, who you know, can indeed influence who gets out of the water and who doesn’t, but it is possible to do so from even from a meager beginning. A difference here, though, is that failing to get out of the water this year does not preclude one from doing so next year. The lesson for the OP is not to get too discouraged, if s/he sticks with it, then someday s/he will be the one attracting exciting TT offers. 4) We may agree on some points, but the lifeboat analogy is actually pretty appropriate, as you admit - more are born than can survive. This was precisely the problem with the Titanic - there were not enough seats for all the passengers, so some will necessarily drown. You're arguing that it's Darwinian, and so am I: there aren't enough spots to go around. If everyone possessed all the grit and fortitude you describe, it still won't increase the number of seats on the lifeboats.We can all stick around until next year, but this won't solve the fundamental problem, which is a shortage. Sticking it out only increases the imbalance between the number of applicants and the number of spots. OP here - my qualm is that s/he JUST got hired last year on a TT. I understand people want better jobs, better lives, better startups, better opportunities - which unfortunately comes at the cost of ruining chances for others. Using your analogy, if there are 10 seats on that boat, and everyone that's already on the boat wants to switch spots, there's no room for those drowning, until someone jumps out. 4) It stinks. I hope something works out for you.","Other job wikis? [Copied from other tab] Hello, does anybody know if there is a similar worksheet for non-strictly eco-evo jobs? I arrived here looking for microbial ecology-agroecology jobs, and this system is awesome, i think this is a great community effort. But only a limited share of jobs is related to my expertise. Does anyone know of more microbe-agroenvironmental oriented ones? (andrea.campisano@fmach.it)","It's been two years since I interviewed.  The faculty who sucessfully (!!) opposed my hire at a school favorites every tweet that criticizes or asks tough questions about my work.  Never my replies.  No other interactions online except that they high five anyone who pushes back against me.  WhyTF do they still care??? 2) sounds like they are petty idiots insecure about their own position and use 'democracy/safety in numbers'  instead of science 3) Wow, what a petty jerk. sorry you're dealing with this- but on the upside, you're awesome enough to have enemies :) 4) Take it as a badge of honor-you're doing the right thing. Science shouldn't be always be about agreement or consensus. 5) That's the pettiest, most passive-agressive example of cowardice I've ever heard of in academia. Wow. 6) I'm not the OP but I have to endure stupid ass comments from a senior old white guy every now and then. 6) Wow, horrible!  How do you know they opposed your candidacy?  7)  Obviously they are secretly in love with you 8) I don't ask for an answer, but I'm very curious what line of research you are in, that it's so contentious. Wind farms, maybe? x2  1) again.  @6, a few friends in the dept told me.  @8, I'm on the evo side not the eco side.  9) OP, are you on the theoretical side? 10) Twitter is the worst","New level of politeness of rejection? Got this after an unsucessfull phone interview ""Although you did not make this short-list, the search committee views you as an unranked alternate who remains competitive for the position."" Is this a new way to be polite or there is a meaning to it? Yeah, I know, it is grasping for straws... 2) On the opposite end, I just got a rejection that was a form email from HR when I was an on-campus interview candidate : ( (1) again here -sorry, that is ridiculous, ouch (2) here again - yeah, it is no good. I think with your thing, they are finding an alternative to the whole 'don't tell any one they are rejected until an offer is accepted in case we need to go back all the way to the full pool of applicants'. I like the idea of ""hey, you're *probably* out of the running"" instead of radio silence.  3)  I had that at 2 schools, but they didn't get back in touch. Based on my own interactions it probably means someone on the committee really loved you and fought for you, but just didn't get their way.  I've heard of them inviting in more candidates in very rare cases. (1) thanks for this nice personal take on this! it brightened my day to even think this way:))  (3) If you're on the market again next year and they have any jobs at all, apply to every last one of them.  You may have a good chance. (1) Thank you (3)! I will definitely do! though there might be an offer from another place... fingers crossed I don't have to go through these months of searching  ...","I have read all the posts here and elsewhere about how inside hires don't neccessarily have an advantage. But when there is an affiliated indiviudal that isn't currently in a TT position, has taught all the courses, and actively doing research in the area on the announcment, it's hard to not be discouraged... (x2) 2) My knowledge of searches this year that had internal candidates went 75% external: 25% internal (n = 4). Oddly enough, the one that went internal I didn't think had a chance of going internal and out of the three that went external, for two of them the job ads seemed to be written specifically for the internal. Moral of the story: always try your best, regardless of insider information. 3) I am an internal candidate, and I think the bar is higher for me. It seems like many on the SC have a grass is greener mentality. In any case, the process is very fair. If I win out, it will be because I was objectively better at the position (including the time I've already spent in it). 4) People keep assuming I am an internal candidate (I'm not, I didnt apply for the job), but my University is hiring a TT position that on paper looks a lot like me. Why? Because its a need that they have. They hired me to fill the teaching gap and mentor students in that area as a place holder until they could get the funding line through to do a TT hire. So the position needs to be filled. I was the best candidate to do it on a non-TT basis for a few years while they got funding. Now they do and I wouldn't expect to have any preferential treatment if I applied, though I may have some insights into departmental dynamics. It comes with costs though. Ever go look at a car for sale that you're really excited about, but then you drive it and its fine but it's just not quite as great as you'd hoped? I'm that car. I'm functional, but they know exactly what to expect and there is no allure of the excitement of a new member of the department or seeing a brand new research talk. 1 here, I apprecieate everyones comments and I do understand that inside candidates don't automatically get a pass and there are some advantages to being an ouside candidate (some of which were listed here). I was just venting on the subject. I submitted the best application package I could and will do my best to knock the interview out of the park if I make it that far. 5) I think internal candidates have, across the board, better odds of landing the job than other applicants (although this varies by institution type); however, the ""higher"" odds they have are still so low that it shouldn't dissuade someone from doing just what the OP is - going all in for positions you want, regardless of rumors. x2 6)  True story - I once dropped out of a search, because there was an internal candidate and I had some other interviews already lined up and didn't want to waste my time.  Turned out the internal candidate did not get the job. 7) I know multiple recent hires at different R1s that could credibly have been considered ""inside candidates"" so they definitely exist, but I think #4 and 5 probably have well-described the dynamics of these searches. At the same time, I think people may be letting what they see happen in administrative searches (Deans, Chancellors, Provosts, Dept. Heads) color their impressions of faculty searches. I know many, many, many more administrators who were appointed to ""interim"" roles and then applied and were hired as part of the search while serving as interim. I imagine some institutions do not allow this, but many do. 8) I've witnessed two searches as a postdoc in the last couple of years. The first had one internal and two external candidates interviewing and the internal one was clearly the best option, and she got the job. The second one also had one internal and two external candidates and the internal candidate (while well qualified for the job) did not appear to be as good as the others and I'm pretty sure one of the exteral candidates has received an offer. 9) I have also seen two searches with an internal candidate the past few years in my dept, both were men with spouses already in t-t positions. Both eventually got and accepted an offer but neither was first choice. The most recent one was unusual in that a fourth candidate for the same position was thrown in at the last minute, offered something, did not accept, then internal got and accepted the next offer. Neither was ""given"" the job, this season's in particular was an impressive candidate, but there did seem to be some unfortunate conflict about the direction his hiring would take the department. Practial takeaway- maybe more likely these folks get the job, as a ""sure-thing"" candidate, but they are also more likely to be used to get a new fresh faculty member in, like #4 very graciously analogized. Definitely apply and do your best at every interview, and never assume you know the outcome of a search ahead of time.","Interview and inside candidates Is it common for the inside candidate to be absent during on-campus interviews of other candidates? When I was an inside candidate I was asked to avoid all contact with others interviewing. The reason was so I did not get any knowledge about the interview process of the other candidates which would possible give me an unfair advantage. I understand and agree that I should not have been present but just curious if this is common. BTW, I did not get the job as the inside candidate. 2) I wish my place had done that, but it can be hard to enforce. I found out I wasn't being considered further when the signup sheet for interviews was posted in the department mailroom. I'd already been planning on recusing myself from interview events, but wish they'd given me the courtesy of treating me like a valid candidate by telling me to stay away. 3)  Yes OP, this is just good professional behavior. x3 4) OP here, thanks for the comments. There were two comments from inside hires that were deleted, they both experienced the same thing. @3 I understand it is good professional behavior, I was curious how common it actually was.","I get the feeling there are a lot of users here who routinely post trying to get updates on certain jobs but when they get an offer they are totally silent. 2) It seems there is a good deal of information on offers here honestly. I am happy even some folks revisit the site to keep us updated.  These job boards get a negative reputation so I am not surprised people jump off of them quickly. 3) When people get an offer, they're probably hesistant to post it on this site if they are in the middle of negotiations. Nothing is final until the official offer letter is signed. x 4 4) People can do what they want but I don't see a problem something simple like ""offer made"" ","Employment Verification I had an on-campus interview last year at institution A, did not get an offer. Now I have an on-campus interview in the same department at institution A. Has anyone ever been in this situation? Is it awkward to go back and repeat the process? 2) Yes, it is awkward, but a second interview is certainly a good sign.  There are surely some members of that department (perhaps a majority) who are very interested in hiring you. 3) I've had this experience and for me it wasn't awkard at all because I really got on well with the faculty.  It was more like a conversation with colleagues the second time around. There were all good indications during my interview that I was going to be offered the position but unfortunately I was the second choice again.  I hope it works out better for you.  Good luck! 4) Well, let me get it straight. You did apply for another position from the same department, and now you're thinking that an on-campus interview from the same department that didn't offer you first time would be awkward? You didn't think about that before applying for the second time? 5) Thanks for the comments. @4: No reason for the sass. Obviously, I knew there was a chance I could get an interview but it's an uncommon dynamic to interview 2x at same place. 6) #4 here. I would just go rock the interview, and pretend that nothing happened in the past. And make sure you never bring it up in any of your conversations during the whole time, not even casually. It's a test. My guts says that they thought earlier that they could've easily hired you over the other candidate, but funding was limited for one position, and so they are desperate to bring you on board on this one. Don't screw it up. Good luck, and thank me later with the good news! 7) I have a friend who interviewed for a job and didn't get an offer (the search failed). It reopened and he re-applied; he got the job and is happy and productive. You never know what goes on in search committees to fail a search or tip one candidate over another--the fact that they asked you back means they already like you, and the rest feels like it can be up to chance. Good luck!! 8) A close friend interviewed for a second time in the same institution. He was offered the job, people liked him and given the opportunity of second position later on they knew that they wanted him. Good luck.  9) a few years ago we interviewed the same person twice in the SAME YEAR!  She got the 2nd job. #4 is being paranoid.  They would only have you back a 2nd time if they liked you a lot the first time and thought you might be the best of the pool the 2nd time around.  8) I agree, if they didn't think you were a good fit for the department, they wouldn't have brought you back. We had someone well qualified who short listed for my position (that she wasn't a great fit for, or else she would have gotten the position over me), and she didn't even short list for a position that I think she would have done well in (and we still haven't hired successfully). So, I would treat it as a very, very good sign, and I certainly wouldn't act like it is your first time there.","First time on the job market here and saw interview invites went out recently for the last remaining of my applications. I went into it knowing it would be hard, but was not prepared at just how depressing/devastating it can be. I’ve dealt with plenty of rejection before, but have always felt like I could at least see a path forward. I personally thought I was in a good place — decent number of pubs and citations, PI on multiple grants, well known post doc lab, lots of teaching and outreach, etc — and then just nothing but crickets. I had multiple people look at my materials and all said they were in great shape, even at departments I ended up applying at. Still rejection after rejection. Worst is this doesn’t just affect me. My partner has had to put their life on hold too over the last 6 months and now have absolutely no certainty of where we will be at a year from now. I’ve had so many PIs tell me over the last few months some version of “if you want this bad enough, you’ll get it” and every time I hear that I get more and more discouraged from giving this another go next cycle because it makes the whole process to me feel like some form of glorified hazing. Put up with enough of this and hold on long enough so you can eventually be accepted and get your turn. When I should be happy for friends and colleagues getting interviews and offers, I have now become irrationally bitter of their success. Alright enough of the venting, just needed some place to put down my thoughts lately, although I am genuinely curious to hear how others manage to keep optimistic or remain hopeful enough to stick with it when things don’t work out as you anticipate.  2) I feel you, OP. As much as some folks like to think (and tell you) that it'll work out and if you just work hard enough and wait your turn, you'll get your chance, I've been fortunate to have many senior mentors be quite honest about what a crap shoot it really is. It's timing, and the elusive ""fit,"" and a lot more luck than I think many people want to admit. I can't say I'm the best person to share how I have managed being optimistic or hopeful as far as sticking it out for an academic position goes, but I will say what has kept me optimistic is really thinking broadly about what it is I want in a job, what I value about my current work, and exploring creative non-academic options to meet those needs/values. I'm still on the academic market this year, but I have to say I'm most excited about some of my non-academic potential opportunities and moving toward a career track/system/organization where I'll be able to use my skills and feel wanted and highly valued rather than the sometimes ""dime a dozen"" the academic gauntlet can leave me feeling. Folks who stick with being on the market long term, I got nothing but respect for their mental and emotional fortitude. 3.) OP, you have put so perfectly into words how I feel too... 4) First time? Better get used to it. IT's horrible. 5) I know crickets is hard, but imagine getting a campus invite for a dream position and not getting it. Waiting it out can lead to whole new worlds of pain. My only advice that could generalize is a) stop putting your or anyone's ""life on hold"" for this. Keep your goals in mind when you make other decisions, fine, but don't confuse dreams for real life, and b) apply for more positions. Unless you're already flooding the field, the only reliable way to get more interviews is to apply more broadly. For me this has had the additional benefit of expanding my own idea of what a ""good"" job/institution would be (also for this, at least glance at non-academic jobs you might go for) 6) The whole process is brutal. Not getting any skype/phone interviews for an entire season sucks. Getting some campus interviews but no offers is also demoralizing. Can't wait for this process to be over, either via TT job or outside of academia (increasingly thinking about non-academic jobs)  7) for everyone thinking about non-academic jobs, I'm sitting here in a campus coffee shop listening to an admin (actually I think she is VP for academic affais) talk about the impending enrollment cliff and all of the challenges ahead for higher education; also recently had a phone interview wherein I asked about potential challenges and opportunities for the department in the future, to which the response was mostly about the challenges and the increasing competition for students; meanwhile rumor is even large state universities (UIdaho e.g.) are discussing vertical restructuring that would eliminate entire departments and give the U opportunities to lay off tenured faculty, to say nothing of downsizing and laying off TT but untenured folks... so, maybe in the end the rejections and the move out of academia could be a blessing in disguise? 8) I am going to echo others here...but I could have literally written the OP statements word for word. And I am in year 6...I don't think there is a secret to handling the rejection other than just find anyone who you can commiserate with about it. Every year I think I am going to leave the grind and then come back for 1 more job cycle like an abusive relationship. 7) It took me 4 years of VAP'ing to get a TT position. I was fast-tracked for tenure, then denied so now I'm on the market again.  It's a soul-crushing business. 8) @7 Same... 9)@8...this is 7 again, are you serious?  That actually makes me want to cry.  I've been feeling like such a freakshow for the past year, I am totally invisible in my department, everyone's uncomfortable talking with me.  I am counting the weeks for the semester to end so I can be unemployed.  I've had a couple interviews - one outside of academia and a VAP.  But I am seriously in bad mental shape right now. Hope you are coping okay. 9) Sorry to hear that others are in the same state who haven't been offered..it is my second time applying..but my visa ends with my position (which is in two months) so it's been really challenging. But yes- you think you are doing all the things and more that are expected of you but dont understand why you're not progressing- and being constrained by a visa limits many potential job opportunities..","Applying for Coop Unit jobs There are a bunch of coop unit jobs open now. I want to share some information that may be helpful when applying. I think there was a comment about that same topic here earlier, and I would encourage any applicants to look for that. In short, the system is designed to keep you out, and the people in HR will eliminate many applicants to these jobs before the hiring committees can look at them. You have to make it through the HR system first. It appears many applicants are not being referred because their official transcript does not list their graduation date. I'm sure there are many ways in which the system is designed to eliminate applicants before the real hiring committee sees the application, but I hope you can be aware of as many possible issues before you apply. If there are people associated with the coop units that can post additional information here, please do so. There are many qualified people here who would like to apply for these jobs but who will be rejected unnecessarily because they just don't know what they need to include.

I haven't been rejected from any of the jobs I applied for (yet), but no interviews/offers either, so I can't say whether this is a winning strategy or not. 4) Thank you for this entry!

"And what next...??? So considering the job market, and the fact that some of these jobs have 150+ applicants anyways, the likelihood of us all getting any job next year is slim regardless of how deserving we may be...I guess my rant is that it sucks that we are all in the job market NOW when there is such a downturn but my question is what the hell are we all going to do next year?  When I was at the end of my grad school career, I swore I would either open a bakery or become a pilot if I somehow failed out.   I definitely didn't fail out (though I'm sure all of us had those days) so now I am here with my lovely PhD in hand and I have no idea what my life will be like in a few months time.  For those of you who have been stuck without a position this year or are facing that prospect now, what have you done/are you planning on doing in the interim?? (1) I have talked with my former postdoc advisor about writing an NSF proposal with him. However, there're a couple problems with that plan. First, I'm still swamped with the duties of my current postdoc (of which the funding will run out this summer) that I haven't even begun the proposal. Second, let's say I make the July deadline, it'll be at least Nov before NSF makes a decision, so I wouldn't know what to do until then. Last but not least, the chance of obtaining a grant is even worse than getting a job these days, so god knows what's going to happen?

2)I'm facing this prospect this year (expired postdoc funding at the end of summer and no offer). I started taking teacher certification classes in January at the College of Education at my university. As a postdoc, I get reduced tuition and fees. I get certified by May. I'm applying to teach high school biology. Starting salary for science teachers in this area is $45K with an additional $5K for a graduate degree. So, it's not too bad (9 month salary, weekends off, ~9-5 job, holidays off, and summers off- perfect for field work). I'm planning to teach until my spouse's postdoc is over, then we can take it from there... Hey, it feeds the family and it's science education. (3) My funding runs out in a couple months and my spouse doesn't work. I have two kids and when my money runs out, we have no income, and no health coverage. I have a mortgage and two small children. Waiting to hear the outcome of one interview. No idea what I'll do next! I'm not sleeping much these days. (4) #1 again. I'm not sure which is more depressing: facing unemployment or the prospect that us, with not only PhD's but also postdoc experience, having to resolve to teaching high school biology. (@ #2, I do not mean the slightest disrespect. I'm feeling your pain and just commenting on this overall grim situation.) (5) I am in a similar situation. I think its best to minimize expectations - right now I am looking forward to some nice personalized rejection letters... ;)  (6) To #1/4 I think you might be surprised to find that due to economic stimulus related increases in the budget of NSF, it may be easier to get a NSF grant funded than it is to get a faculty position this year.  Good luck! (7) Also the funding increase will probably mean more postdoc positions as well, so that may be helpful for those of us who may be seeking employment next year off the TT. 8) #2 here, @ #4 no worries!  I totally agree with you. We gotta do what we gotta do... I'm just happy that I have an option that at least puts my years of education to good use, and the pay is not too shabby either. Cheers! (9) In the same boat! I got offered a TT position after by first interview this yr, but declined it bc it wasn't the best fit - i don't regret the decision.  Now that none of the other jobs came through, i feel a bit worried though.  No funding for next yr, just my husband's poorly paid postdoc. So my plan now is to cast my net a bit more broadly, and get pregnant, taking the opp to focus on other life priorities, while continuing to function as a postdoc.  Hopefully something will come through next yr! (10) Dr. Freud is proud of that last sentence.  (11)  Does anyone know if we qualify for unemployment benefits?  You figure we have been paying into the system for so long, but do we qualify?  Wishing academics weren't always treated poorly....","deleting entries I discovered last week that a job I had a phone interview for had never been added to the wiki.  I added it.  It got deleted.  I've now added it and had it deleted 3 times.  Am I breaking some rule, or isn't it wrong to delete jobs from the wiki? (1) ??? what job was it? (2) And it's been deleted a fourth time.This is not a vent, it's just an honest question of why on earth someone keeps deleting this job? 2) Thought it was the UC Davis eco job. That one keeps getting deleted too. (4) I'm not a big enough jerk to do this, but I just thought how hilarious it would be to delete this entire entry! No offense meant, OP, but just picturing your reaction if this got deleted too makes me die laughing. I guess I've been job searching too long...easily amused. Apparently ""Big Brother"" has something. Any word post-phone interview from them? Good luck. (5) Yeah, this deleting business ha (5) Trolls. 6) Hilari 7) ous  8) I had this happen for a job I kept adding (not UC Davis).  I had to add it 3X before it finally stopped getting deleted.  What gives? 9) I bet it's a glitch in Google docs instead of malicious deleting. To (possibly) prevent this, hit Save in the File menu after making updates.10) I love your optimism about human nature #9, but if you see a job disappear it's relatively easy to go through the revision history of the spreadsheet and see when it was posted and how long it was up.  If the user was logged in, you can even see who deleted it, otherwise you can just see when it was erased.  It might be fun to post the usernames of people who delete jobs. 11) Yeah, fun for someone with nothing better to do. ",NA,NA,"BS Its time that all of the PHDs in all fields who are unemployed to start ragging on their state reps to do something about this. I just telephone interviewed for a vacancy for which their were over 600 applicants.  IF there are that many of us out there unemployed or underemployed in the various fields, and I would suggest that in some fields its far more than in the ecology field, there is a problem.  Maybe its time to put maximum quotas on graduates, or mandatory retirement ages, or mandatory productivity for deadwood, I don't know.  But I'm watching on here and realize very clearly that 90% of the applicants will never get a job, and based on previous posts on there about productivity, 90% of the employed don't do anything to warrant a paycheck.  What is wrong with this picture? I think you have to get in line behind all the Art History grads, the Philosophy grads, and the English grads. Ultimately your career is your choice so I'm not sure what you expect the government to do? 2) OK, I know this was just a rant/vent, but I've got a lot I can say because this is a complicated topic.  But I'll try keep it short: I'm sorry, the situation sucks, but you are not owed a job, and you are most certainly not owed somebody else's job.  Academia is not there for you to get a job, it has a different purpose.  Despite what many of our advisors told us, it is not there so that we can get paid to do our hobby--that time has passed and is not coming back.  It's there to educate students and help move society forward.  If you get your goals in line with the goals of colleges and universities and their constituent departments, you will end up on short lists and with interviews.  If your goal is to get a job, you will not.  I'm not trying to hate on you, but you need to reframe.  Focus on the things that are in your control. 3) #2, as a faculty member, your remedy sounds easy (reframing one's career), but in reality it's not. It's a bit tough to guess what will be marketable and what not 6 years from now when PhD's and postdocs hit the market.  Luck is a major factor in anyone's career these days, it's impossible to predict what sort of market all of the universities in each of the 50 states may have, whether they think that all granting agencies are fair game or only biomedical/NIH money is desirable because of a perceived public interest in health over ecology. 4) No, no-one has a right to a job, unless they are already tenured and have not published or kept up in their field for 20 years.  In which case, the department will complain, but otherwise do nothing.  In any other field, a person who ceases to even try to do their job gets fired.  Here, they are protected by others who are too afraid they might be the next target. Signed: Tenured professor.  5) Sure, I'll focus on the bills that can't be paid and on how I cannot afford to publish the results I have at the level needed to make myself more competitive.  Society does not move forward when you pump out experts who go on to be unemployed.  It sets it back because the non-educated look and say, ""Hey, a degree and education is worthless!"" and then they vote to cut budgets more.  I guess others are just living a very sheltered life with family who are willing to pay all their bills while they live in the basement. 6) I want to make three points. A) Nobody owes anybody a job. However, this market is intensely competitive and luck is a major player in one's success. Simply reframing your outlook may work as a pallative but it won't get you a job. It is great if you can simply put aside 'careerist' concerns and focus on science and teaching. However, finding a job is a source of stress for a lot of us and we are left trying to figure out where to move next. We have families, partners and bills to pay. Personally, more than anything I want to just focus on being a good scientist and teacher. I worry that I won't ever be able to do that. B) Deadwood tenured profs are a problem to be sure. In my opinion, tenure as it is structured is more problematic than beneficial. However, this is not the only problem. In my current department we have had deaths and retirements. Multiple positions have remained unfilled as the Dean is hesitant to fill those tenure lines. Couple this with a rise in PhD grads and we see why the market is competitive. It is easy to direct our anger at a couple of deadwood profs but they are only one issue. C) Finally, while I agree that these are our personal decisions and we should be held responsible for our career choices, we need to change the thinking within our academic society. I still see a world where the R1 prof is the pinnacle job and all training is dedicated that goal. Advisors and whole departments often feel that if you are trained for that goal...you are trained for most everything else. This makes it difficult for students to get specfic training and explore non R1 career options. Most people are highly influenced by peers and advisors. I care what people think of me and am influenced by my peers and mentors. We are social animals. We should be held responsible but to not see the impact that our culture plays on our decisions is absurd. Things need to change (although I can't see how the government should be involved. This is something we need to change in our own culture). 7) This is commenter #2 here again.  Thanks everyone for keeping this emotionally-charged topic respectful.  There are lots of good points here.  I should point out that yes, I have a good job in academia, but it took me 10 years post-PhD to get it.  I have been there.  And what I realized during that long haul is that I was NOT a good candidate 10 years ago.  I had papers, I had teaching experience, etc., but I didn't know yet what being faculty really meant and what it takes.  This wasn't my fault; yes it's a major flaw of how graduate programs train their students, which, for many programs, means training students for the job market that existed 30 years ago.  And yes, it definitely includes pumping out too many PhDs, which is how many institutions judge the success of their graduate programs.  But I had to to figure out what the program was and take my career into my own hands.  I became a better candidate because, even in my adjunct positions (yes, been there, too), I DID NOT just focus on my teaching and research (contrary to point 6A).  I focused on becoming a part of the institution, on trying to do as much as I could for it, on understanding how it and my department ran, and getting a bigger picture view of why things are the way they are.  THIS is what I meant about reframing.  It's NOT just about your teaching and research.  I found advocates and mentors outside my department and program, I found people who could give me the advice that my PhD advisor (and possibly yours) couldn't/didn't, I figured out how departments and institutions work now, not how they worked 30 years ago.  I was too glib with my point about reframing.  My real point is that you can only get the job you're looking for by fully understanding it and taking responsibility for preparing for it.  And the payoff for me is that now I am in a position where I can hopefully change things for the better, where I can improve the way academia works, and where I can have a much greater impact that 1000 letters to a state rep who didn't even finish college.  And finally, yes, luck abosultely plays a huge role in this job market, and I have been very, very lucky.  But if it  8) Technically, for the past 10-15 years the US Department of Labor had environmental sciences listed as high growth and high job prospects.  So, the false advertising has contributed.  Further, recent social science researchers suggest that YES everyone has a right to a job because it is an essential foundation upon which you exercise the rights guaranteed to all in the US, Life, liberty and pursuit of happiness.  So, you folks who say no one has a right to a job, might want to do some homework. 9) Ok correction...Nobody has a right to get a job as a tenure-track faculty member in Ecology.  10) They have a right if society has trained them to do so, especially those who are educated in a public institution.  If society fails to live up to their end of the deal, society has failed and allocated resources foolishly.  Strict application of supply and demand leads to chaos, that's why there are things like subsidies.  11) if academia got the subsidies that the oil companies get, we would be employed!  12) all the ""no-one has a right to a job"" BS is warmed over bullcrap distributed by holier than thow republican and libertarian crackheads.  We saw how that worked out in the Great Depression. Get over yourself. 13) The fact is, of the 600 applicants mentioned by the OP, it's true that probably 550 of them will never get the job they want.  The other 50 have a good shot, and it's not just because they're lucky.  They're doing something the others aren't. 14) Everyone has the right to a job if they want one, but no one has a right to any job they want. If that were true I'd have a job laying on a beach sipping beverages every day. 15) Where did this idea come from, that everyone has an individual right to a job, like you get a ticket at birth and you get to cash it in for a job of your choosing later in life?  This might be how you want things to be, but claiming that you have a right to employment in academia is absurd.  You have a right to *work*, and the right to seek employment without being discriminated against, etc., etc., but you have to actually earn a particlar position/job if someone else is to be your employer.  Are people trolling on here, or is this actually not understood? 16) It is the end of the job season and the rejection letters are coming in. The market sucks. I think people are just venting. It is a bit silly. I can't imagine that people think 'ragging on state reps' would help in any way. There are a lot more pressing problems than a handful of us overeducated PhDs that can't find jobs in academia. As a proud liberal, I wouldn't make this my main (or even minor) issue if I was an elected official. Work on your papers, become a better teacher or start looking at other careers. Be productive. You have seven months until the applications need to flow again...move forward and stop whining. 17) These people are not whining.  IN FACT, the fact that several tenured tenure-track faculty have taken the time to post on here, and it appears they are saying DON""T comment to politicians, should tell you something.  Guess what?  I'm a tenured professor, have been at half a dozen schools, and I know very well that close to half of academics don't do a thing to warrant their breathing air once they make tenure.  I saw a post on ecolog about 30+ percent don't publish, that is horribly under-estimated unless at and R1.  A lot of people get tenure and stop everything.  I am a tenure proponent, but I'm also a post-tenure review proponent because I'm tired of sharing faculty meetings with individuals whose greatest accomplishment was their dissertation 30 yrs ago, and who spend most of their time water skiing on weekends.   ",please take my survey on your job search in 2014!  Thank you whoever deleted the message on the front page for me! :) https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/TZHKCMC,"I know I'm really lucky to be getting on-campus interviews, so I can't complain about that, but really, what the hell is wrong with these committees that make you fly across the country and can't be bothered to just take you out to dinner?  Between airport parking fees and dinners out on these interviews, I'm going in the hole and no one seems to reimburse for this.  Plus, I've had to buy my own plane ticket for each with who knows how long before I will be reimbursed...I'm about to max out my low limit. 2) Bummer...I must admit that I have never bought my own airline ticket. Also, are you not getting dinner out during the interviews? Usually the only thing I end up paying for is meals while travelling..even then most places reimburse but I am always too lazy to send in receipts.  3) That's weird that they made you buy the airplane ticket! Was this a smaller school? 1) again here.  yeah, all small schools.  They usually end up taking me to dinner on one night, but then I'm on my own for the other night.  One place put me up in a nice (really nice) hotel, but I'd just gotten in and had no car so I just went to the hotel restaurant...and spent $35 on a plate of vegetables (the cheap thing on the menu). COME ON SEARCH COMMITTEES, get your shit together. 4) you should definitely get reimbursed for ALL travel expenses. Even at small schools. 4) I'm at a small school and our average reimbursement time is 2 weeks. We reimburse for the plane ticket and all meals (or the drive and meals). We book and pay for the hotel upfront. Oddly enough, I always thought we came off looking cheap b/c the candidates have to pay for all their own meals upfront, but now I don't feel so bad hearing that some universitites are not covering anything. I will note, travel budget for candidates can vary dramatically between universities. At the two previous universitites I was associated with all candidate travel expenses were covered by the college. Where I am at currently, the department foots the bill. This can have dramatic consequences on a department if they fail a search or have to bring in extra candidates. Fortunately, even though our department foots the bill, the college has thrown us money in those circumstances. ","Anon Quals deletions 1)  Has anyone ever used a professional negotiator?  Do you think it was worth it? 2) Interesting idea. I would think this would be tricky. You would have to get one that knew academics well. I would guess (but I am ignorant here) that businesses are often about salary and that is only one small part of an academic negotiation. 3) I suggested this on ecolog or the chronicle forums and was lambasted for suggesting such a thing.  Personally, I think we shoudl all have professional agents who search out the job and sell us to the departments.  Only the admin seem to have this available right now. 4) 1 again.  I talked to someone who used a negotiator in real life and HIGHLY recommended it.  This person hired the author of The Professor is In blog - who was previously a tenured professor and dept head 5) #2 here. That sound slike it might work really well.  6) She is not a negotiator, she jentust provides advice on how to negotiate and on CV issues.  I followed her advice on the CV and it was a disaster.  I think she gives good advice, but I don't think it is universally appropriate for the sciences. 6) If I remember right, she notes that you should highlight in your cover letters who you want to collaborate with. This always seemed to be a disaster. I can't imagine doing that. What if the said person wasn't interested or if another person you overlooked was really excited and you seemingly blew them off.","That moment when the search committee chair tells you to expect a phone call the next day inviting you for an interview. Followed by lots of moments over the following two weeks when that phone call never comes.  2) that's just mean!!!  3) If they flat out told you you're getting an interview I might find a way to tactfully follow up.  That's really weird. 4) Same here!  It's been 2 weeks since I was invited for a campus interview but haven't heard anything since then about scheduling the visit.  Maybe they are dealing with administrative crap.  My other interview was booked within 24 hours of the invite so I thought the former invite was a little strange... 5) Dealing with similar problems. Glad I'm not crazy. 4 again) Yay my interview was finally scheduled.  I think the holidays just slowed everything down. OP again) Mine too! Yay! 6) Never trust a search chair. As the person responsible for the search, they have a vested interest in recruiting someone, so they will tell all candidates how wonderful they are because they will be blamed if the search fails. OP) Well I ended up getting offered this job, so I'd say having faith in the SCC was a good thing in the end.","Snacking while interviewing? For medical reasons I need to have a morning snack and a couple of afternoon snacks, in addition to normal mealtimes.  Any tips for how to be less awkward about this during an interview?  I will of course be bringing my own snack food with me. 1) Just be upfront about it. I am sure people wouldn't mind. 2) I almost always snack right before my seminar. Noone's ever been awkward about it.  Just tell people why, shouldn't be a problem. 3) It is only awkard if you make it awkard. 4) I snacked too, often when walking between meetings, before my seminar, or (if I wanted to be extra sneaky) by asking for a bathroom break and pounding a granola bar over the sink. 5) I snack between meetings too!  Some of the nicer/more aware faculty have offered me food/coffee/water during the meeting. 6) I envy all of you snacky people, my stomach usually collapses and nothing gets in. 7) Glad to hear this likely seems more awkward to me than it does to the people I am meeting with!  I found in my interview last year that there really was no ""between meeting"" time since I was talking with whoever walked me to my next appointment.  I definitely crammed in food in the bathroom, though.  8) just tell faculty you need this.  Anyone half decent wants you to be at your best, and so wants you to snack as needed to keep your energy up.  Same as a bathroom break, only an ass would want to talk to you while you have to pee! 9) I'll just say those squeezy-fruit packets for toddlers are delicious, quick, and highly portable. I could inhale one of those in about 15 seconds. 10) #9, can you take them on the plane if you don't also have a young child?  I see some are larger than 3oz. 9) Good question - I don't know the answer. 11) Personally, I think every department and search committee wants candidates to starve. 12) I lost weight after 3 interviews 13) I gained 10lbs on interviews...14) when our department interviews candidates, whenever they are seen eating or using the bathroom, I decide right there to vote against them for appearing too human.  15) Little known secret: holding it all day shows the committee you've got what it takes.  16) Ahh, that explains my lack of offers. 15) Me, too. ","Ahhhh the waiting! I know the committee has met. I know they've given their recommendation to the administration. Now it's ""in the hands of the administration"" whatever that means (somewhere between the dean and the provost...). What are you doing to distract yourself to not descend into an anxiety pit of constantly refreshing your email, checking your phone, and staring at this wiki??  1) Oh, I'm so in the same boat!!  Wonder if it's for the same job? 2) oh god, I hope we're not all waiting to hear about the same job, because this is me, too.  1) I would go with highly unlikely, since only 3 people interviewed total for the one I'm waiting on. 3) How can you tell when the SC met? 4) read tea leaves 2) They often tell you when the vote is planned for the position 5) Yep, I emailed to ask about the status and timeline and they told me the committee had made their recommendation to the dean so it was in the admin's hands 6) They did not tell me in my case, I would assume they have voted by now though (2.5 wk after last interview). Would it be OK to ask? 7) You could, but some places are very secret and tell you nothing. Some will tell you if they chose someone else but would consider you as a plan B. Some will tell you nothing until the Dean/Provost and others have approved the offer and the other candidate accepted it. If you haven't heard anything weeks after the last interview, you could write the department chair, but I'd expect a vague email, which short of an offer, means they are dealing with another candidate. 8) I e-mailed the SCC about a month after I interviewed (within a week of the last interview) and he told me that they were in negotiations with someone else but that I was still on ""the list"" if negotiations fell through. Eventually, I got an official rejection 3 months after this e-mail.  Sometimes it doesn't hurt to ask!","Names I see in some of the comments that names are being suggested as who got which positions in the main jobs page. I think people should stop doing that. 2) Why,  it's public knowledge, I don't think any department is going to keep the name of its renew hire a secret. 3) In general, I lean towards privacy, but once the offer has been accepted, why not? 4)OP here, I just feel that the tone of those posting are inappropriate i.e. suggesting so-and-so was an internal candidate 5) Some other discipline job boards post the names of all people invited for interviews and who got the job as a matter of course. I'v always felt like I would rather see that; at least then you have some idea of how you compare (on paper anyway) with the people who are getting interviews rather than having the whole thing be mysterious. For whatever reason Ecology & Evolution folks seem to be very against this idea. 6) It's an issue of privacy and conflict of interest. Imagine if you were competing against someone you knew who you didn't particularly like, say you thought they got through their career with a lot of help, unlike you who had to work more, etc. Or who got on many papers because they lobbied hard though they contributed little, etc. Everyone has these thoughts and for some it's challenging to keep them in.  Another issue: it's illegal in some states to post names. In other states, it's the law that names have to be posted (e.g., Florida). In my book, the least I know about my competition, the better. I can focus my strengths and tell them my story. 7) Eh, I agree that there is a potential for people to act badly, but people inclined to do that can likely figure out who is interviewing for many jobs on their own anyway and all that you've done by leaving names off the wiki is to make the information a bit harder to find (or worse, make it so that only 'connected' people hear through the grapevine such that the information is not equally available). I hear what youa re saying about focusing on your own story, but there is so little feedback in the whole job process that being able to look at the records of people getting interviews at least provides one way to get information on what you should be working on. For example, it should be pretty obvious if you just aren't competitive based on publication/funding record. Alternatively, if those are right on par with interviewees, it probably suggests that the issue is pitching/selling your research and improving job materials. I for one think that is valuable. I don't know about the legal issues you raise, but I suspect they only apply to the members of the search committee themselves. Certainly lots of universities (in many states) put interviewees right on their public web pages. Other fields (like astrophysics: http://www.astrobetter.com/wiki/Rumor+Mill+Faculty-Staff) routinely list even the names of people making long or short lists! Those come from all different states and they don't seem to have any legal troubles and have been doing it for years. I'm not saying we should do that, but it really seems to be more of a cultural difference for eco-evo vs. other fields (and by the way, I'm not posting any names on here...I get that people don't want that public on here, I'm just saying that I don't really agree with the motivation). 8)OP here again. I am all for openness to listing interviewee names and whoever gets the position. People are going to find out anyway a few months later. But the way names were thrown on this wiki seems like trying to ""name-shame"" people e.g. so-and-so got the job because they are an internal candidate. 7) Yes, OP, I agree with you there. I was just talking in general. I haven't noticed the ones you are referring to. 8) Golden rule: would you want yourself named? 9) Please don't post names of interviewees. Faculty members trying to switch jobs generally prefer to keep it on the down low. 10) Yes - names should not be published unless required by law. Moreover, this thread is about as useful as the one by someone who wanted to develop a method to determine if there were internal candidates. 11) @10 - how about after acceptance?  I notice some places are tweeting their new hires 12) I've even received a rejection this year with the name of who they hired. 12) Of course, after acceptance, names can be released. By then both parties are in agreement and there is no need for privacy. . I can't imagine anyone working anonymously, at least in this business. 13)  This is a fucking Wiki!!!  There are no laws being broken here.  We are not breaking privacy laws!  If someone suggests that there is what looks like an internal candidate at a university that was recently hiring, what does it matter?  The person is already there, so we're just stating the obvious.  Now, if someone were to out a candidate that was not an internal hire that didn't want it broadcast that they were job hunting, that's a different story, but I see no problem with hypothesizing that there may be good fits already at a school someone has applied to.  I see no harm in that at all.  Here's something I don't like if we want to talk about bull shittery.  I can't stand the folks that say ""offer accepted"" or ""phone interviews being conducted"", but then offer zero elaboration as to how they know that.  Are they candidates?  Did they accept the offer?  Did they get a rejection letter/e-mail?  Did they get a phone interview.  I know I applied for one position where the chair said they were still going thru applications a few weeks ago and thens someone posted ""offer accepted"", which doesn't jive with what the chair said, but then offers no additional information on how they know that. How do we know it's not just someone screwing with us? 14) You're talking about the St. Edward's gig, yea? But yea, this right here might be the reason I don't use the wiki next year. Does it really do us any good to find out we didn't make a cut? Does this place just drive more awfulness? And don't searches *sometimes* go back into the broader group of candidates to re-interview? Overall, I feel like the wiki has done me more harm mentally than good in finding out that I didn't get a phone interview. The amount of time I've wasted on here... x2 15) Why are so many folks upset with the St. Edward's position? There are so many other good jobs on the wiki! 16) <-- I've wondered the same thing, #15!  on a different note, their mascot is Topper the Goat. 16) Well, re: St. Edward's, there haven't been a lot of jobs for invertebrate biologists this round. Also, it's in a nice, still affordable city where many of our non-academic partners (if you have 'em) could probably get jobs (as opposed to the invert bio jobs that have been quite rural). And poor communication on the part of the admin has just been salt in the wound, so to say. 17) There were the two UT-Austin positions which were very broad. 18) Austin is not affordable for faculty, unless you are 1) wealthy 2) have a wealthy spouse 3) plan on commuting into the city or 4) plan on renting a house near (within 10 miles of) campus forever. 19) St. Ed's was a good school if you wanted a SLAC with a lot of teaching- I don't want an R1 position, for a variety of reasons. And as far as expense, coming from other metropolitan areas in the US, it didn't seem so bad to me. Also, ability for partner to actually get a job (as opposed to them not being able to get a job), with the combined income, etc., 20) Putting names here can hurt people - there are good reasons a person might not want anyone to know they're looking for a job. We have no idea who may or may not want their names here, and it doesn't provide any tangible good to anyone. The irony of people logging in anonymously to demand other people's names! x3 21) Austin is the most expensive city in Texas and one of the most expensive cities outside of California or the northeast corridor. small 3 bedrooms will set you back around $400k. 22)  All you have to do is drive 20-30 miles out of downtown Austin to find affordable housing.  You don't have to live in the city. Also, my research indicates that they pay pretty damn good.  In fact, what I saw indicated on UT-Austin paid more than Edwards in that area.  Anyway..... I don't see a problem with saying, ""Hey, there's a guy there already that looks like he fits the bill; maybe he got it"".  I see now harm in mentioning his name, as he's already there, so it's not doing him any harm if his employer found out he got it, as he's not changing employers, but, yes, I would never mention the name of someone that applied someplace that is looking to change positions and I know plenty.  ;)  23) I hope you're happy driving some 40-60 miles a day! I think privacy is something that should be respected, if you don't work for the department or university, it's not your business to make announcements for them. 24)  You're a laughable twit.  Shit, when you live in TX, a 30 minute commute is nothing.  I already live in Texas and drive about 40 miles to and from work every day so that I could find affordable property.  It's really not that big of a deal when you have a 4 cylinder car or a hybrid and satellite radio.  ;)  Clown shoes 25) Dear Jack Ass: I live in Texas and drive 2 miles a day to and from work. ","anybody ever completely bomb an interview? this cycle I interviewed at a pretty excellent R1 that in principle would have been a good fit and I screwed it up pretty well. I handled all the meetings pretty well I think, but my talk was overlong, rough around the edges, and I kept losing focus and repeating things. my chalk talk was an out and out catastrophe. exhaustion nerves and poor prep resulted in a pretty much embarrassing slow motion train wreck of incoherent and disorganized babbling. how have I managed to get so deep into this career only to start imploding at this critical point? I'm gonna lose it. I think I'm burned out. 2) had a similar experience.  Gave a good seminar and had decent meetings but totally bombed the chalk talk.  I had never heard of a chalk talk and didn't know what one was until I was about 15 minutes deep.  Nobody was impressed and it wrecked any chance I might have had at the job. 3) wrecked mine too previously. x2 4) Do you actually know it was a disaster? I just got an offer at a place where I was 100% sure I'd screwed up the skype interview, then completely botched my meeting with the Dean during my on campus interview, and had a rough talk after I got flustered by some technical issues (on their end, not mine). In hindsite, it may not have been nearly as disasterous as I thought it was when I was done, but I definitely went back to the hotel and had a little bit of a cry at my own incompetence. 5) Yep, but it was just a skype interview. It was international though, and due to time differences it was at 3:30am my time (and I got to bed at like 10:30; definitely not a night person) and I had a horrible cold. I completely embarassed myself with how bad it was. 6) I've only had to give one chalk talk. I was so nervous, but in the end thought it went great! The search chair told me it went great! Only to find out that I wasn't offered the job, in large part because my chalk talk offended one of the faculty members for not giving enough background (their research was tangentially related, and apparently I didn't give that person their full due. Even though it was only tangentially related.) Lesson learned. Decisions can easily go either way, regardless of how well it seemed to go at the time. 7) I think it is very hard to give a truly good chalk talk. I'm a postdoc at a highly ranked R1 that has had three job searches over last 2-3 years in my general area that included chalk talks, so there have been ~15 chalk talks given for those searches. I haven't attended all of them, but the most positive response I've heard is that someone's chalk talk was 'pretty good' and the majority of candidates have given chalk talks that were received negatively despite being super strong candidates in every other way and giving good research seminars. It is such a hard format and I don't think the candidates have had clear guidance on how to use the time. Many of them have gotten derailed for long stretches on strings of questions from the audience that lead away from what the speaker had prepared. I really hope not to have to give one myself... 8) I think some disciplines would be much easier to chalk-talk than others. Being a functional morphologist who likes to draw pictures, I think it would be a blast, but I've never had to give one.  9) One of my firends didn't shine in their interview, but they're now a highly successful assistant prof. Loads of candidates don't do everything right but wind up getting great jobs later. It's absolutely no fun, but in my experience, it doesn't  say anything about you or your ability to land one down the line. 10) 2 again - yes, I was told during the interview by one of the faculty (small department) that my seminar was good but my chalk talk was very weak.  I doubt that was the only deciding factor - I think the job went unfilled in the end - but it definitely did not help.  11) I've seen god awful chalk talks get the job.   Not what you want to do, but just do your best next time and keep plugging.  12) I also thought I bombed a chalk talk, but got the job and now have seen quite a few further interviews and all the chalk talks left me feeling somewhat unsatisfied. It's an open-ended format and impossible to completely prepare for, also impossible to connect with everybody in the room at the same level. Most important to somehow demonstrate that you have ambitious yet realistic vision of what you would do with the job opportunity. But to add maybe a more sympathetic note, yes I totally bombed my first interview, I was so nervous and stumbled through much of it in a panicked haze, that was bad. Resolved to do better, and did.","how late? Currently waiting to hear from 4 places (one I've had a phone interview with, the others don't appear to have done phone interviews yet). How late do these searches run for a fall 2018 start date? Could we still be in interview/negotiation land in July? Just seems like these departments are running things pretty tight... 2) FWIW I intereviewed for a Fall 2017 start date as late as mid-May last year.... 3) I think  a lot of times things slow the search but they just leave the aggressive potential start as the fall semester on the announcement, even though in most cases the person hired negotiates a later start.","One month post-interview. No word from chair since polite reply to 'thank you' note week of. No word on re-embursement from accounting staff either...  2) I think it's reasonable to contact them for a status update! 3) at least make sure your get the reinbursement.  4) Some universities have time limits on reimbursement, so definitely make sure you contact them about this ASAP.  They may simply be waiting for you to submit receipts, etc.  If you've already done that, then it may just be a matter of time, but it still doesn't hurt to contact. 5) OP here. Thanks for the advice on re-embursements. They cut checks later this month. 6) See the above post #6 for my experience with lack of communication!",Interviewing again at same place ,"A school had me pay for my flight and hotel room myself for a campus interview (I can manage that, myself, but do disapprove on principle since I know not everyone can). In November. I still haven't gotten reimbursed. My last email inquiring about it got no response--we'll see if the one I sent today does. How hard is it to pay people back!? 2) Have they at least accepted the receipts and ""started the process"" or have they not even communicated at all since returning? It's still pretty bad though. 3) Call them. 4) That's pretty bad. Ideally they have you started on the process before you even leave the interview. A few weeks to a month at most before you have the money. Otherwise some people might have to carry a credit card balance. 5.) When I didn't get reimbursed, my Dad suggested emailing above the department (something like the Dean). I have heard for others that emailing a boss helps get things moving. 6) If you don't want the job 5's advice is great 1 again) I sent them receipts in November (they never asked at the interview and I forgot then, but I sent them as soon as I got home) and was told they'd be taking care of it. I'll try calling next, and if that doesn't work emailing higher-ups of some kind. 6, no need to worry about that--they sent me a rejection a good while ago, so there's nothing here to lose except a few hundred dollars! 7) Go get your money! 8) This happened to me last year, it took them from november to june (7 months, almost a whole pregnancy) to reimburse. On top of that, I never got an thankyou email or to let me know that the search was over. I obviously made sure to let everyone of my colleagues know that dept. sucks. I emailed/called the dept. manager every week until I got my money. 9) I am dealing with a similar experience with an interview from early December. I sent them the receipts right after I got back and nothing. Have been trying to get this resolved now for months-hotel, cross country airfare, rental car I mean it adds up! Its a major barrier for people that aren't able to drop over 1k on an interview. Come on do better! 10) This is crazy. I realized yesterday that the hotel on one of my interviews accidentally charged my card instead of the department. They called the hotel and had it settled within 24 hours! 1 again) The chair did eventually get back to me to just say that the process is really slow but he'd check on it--three months is waaaay too slow, though. But it sounds like it might be an issue with the whole institution, rather than just the department. I'll probably get it someday! 11) I had a similar thing! They took 8 weeks to get reimbursed, and there were screw-ups with my hotel reservation and ride from the airport. They also contacted me the day before Thanksgiving for a campus interview less than 2 weeks out, and had absolutely no flexibility on the dates - it was in the middle of a conference, and I ended up having to take a red-eye across the country. It was a really awful way to treat candidates.","Calling on universities to end ties with police X-Campus Statement Against State Terror and Call for Termination of University-Police Ties

"Something nice Post nice rejections :)  With all of the search committees out there with less than desirable communication skills, I thought I would start a thread on those that really try. (1) I just got the nicest rejection letter ever: ""... Your application was very competitive and the exceptional qualifications of so many applicants made the job of the search committee especially challenging. We wish you success in your ongoing research and in your job search..."". I don't care if it is a form letter used by 100s of searches - actually made my day. Thank you out there to all of the considerate search committees. (2) ""After finishing our phone interview process, we narrowed down to three candidates to bring to campus for interview. I am sorry to inform you that you have not been selected to come for an interview. However, I do want to emphasize that we are very impressed with your application and your phone interview, and that we are keeping you very much in our 'active' list to be considered until the position is filled."" -- and this e-mail was apparently sent by the dept chair himself rather than just a secretary.
(3) I contacted the SC of an ""open until filled"" position kind of late, knowing they were close to a short list. He encouraged me to send in my materials, so I did the next day. Later that day he sent me an email, complimenting me on my research but saying they had a applicants with more experience and more publications. He said if the position isn't filled this year, he'd encourage me to apply next year. I thanked him for being both prompt and honest. 
(4) Tears rolled down my computer-bleary eyes when I read your touching testimonials.
(5) This one was a bit lengthy and over-the-top, but was refreshing to get: “We were pleased by the response to our announcement of a faculty position, and we received applications from many extremely well qualified individuals. You were among those well qualified individuals. After careful review of all of the applications, we offered the position to an individual who seems to offer the most to our Biology program and makes what we perceive to be the best fit with our institution. Today I received confirmation that the offer was accepted. This process has taken longer than anticipated, and I regret the delay in getting definitive information to you.” Then went into few sentences about the new hire’s credentials. “I apologize for the delay in updating you with regard to the status of your application; this process never goes as quickly as hoped, and it is particularly difficult when so many excellent applicants are involved. You are a well qualified individual, and it is our regret and loss that we are unable to offer you a position at this time. Thank you for your interest.” 
(6) Whoa, #5, did you make out with the SC?
(7) @6 - I don't swing that way (not that there's anything wrong with that). Plus, I didn't even interview there...probably 100 other people with the same letter. :) 
(8) @ #4, I must have read your comment >20 times now, and it still gives me a good laugh when I read it. It's nice to get some small relief from this wiki every now and then.","SUNY-Syracuse Anyone get confirmation that their application had gone through? I hate the automated systems where you just get a number, and can't quite tell how to check that they got everything (1) If you are referring to SUNY-ESF in Syracuse, I applied for a different position there once, and not everything went through.  I was contacted by the SC chair, but I would advise contacting them to verify they have all of your stuff. (op): thank you! Good suggestion.",NA,NA,"advice Although I see that there is some benefit for asking for advice on this site, I think the pool is too small to be helpful in all cases. I would suggest that anyone who needs advice about the job process (or academia) visit the Chronicle of Higher Education Forums. I visited the site over the course of several years as a doctoral student and post doc and there are many many people there who are helpful, knowledgeable, and willing to spend a lot of time with anyone who asks. There is very little snark or trolling that goes on as the members monitor things pretty well. Although it won't always be specific to the sciences (there are a lot of other disciplines represented), it's really invaluable.   http://chronicle.com/forums/ 1) I agree that the chronicle forums are really helpful. People from all fields are on the site so it can be a pain to sift through. I think it complements this wiki (I get so little work done from Dec through mid Feb because of this crap!!) 2) Are you sure it is not because of abusing the eggnog? 3) my advise to get through the wretched job season: learn to code. its addictive, will keep you attention away from the paralyzing job prospects. And when its done, you actually have constructed something out of a tough period. Thank me later - cheers. 4) WTF...learn to code!! Ugh. I am avoiding coding and writing at the moment....The coding addiction is past for me.  4) Some of the peole on CHE forums give good advice. Others are simply jerk-offs.  Some of them give bad advice deliberately, and there are a group of say 10-15 who back each other up on bad advice.  Maybe they think its good, but most of theirs in particular is horrible if you are in the sciences.  Ecolog is good, except you can't be anonymous unless you sign up with a fake email address, which you can do by the way! :) 5) I also urge caution on the CHE forums.  There's a large group of people who spend their entire lives there.  They will shout down dissent and will overwhelm any advice given that doesn't agree with their own.  It's dominated by a social club of people with too much time on their hands, and these are not the people you want to be seeking advice from.  Is there good advice to be found there?  Yes, lots, but it's a lot of work to separate the wheat from the chaff. 6) I have found the CHE forum useful but I agree, the ""frequent posters"" tend to be in the humanities and much of their advice just doesn't apply in the sciences. 7) if no science/bio forum, why don't we start one there? 8) I would love a biology sub forum.  I don't know how to start one.  Post a link here if anyone does... 9)  I posted a thread, now if we just put in our 2 cents maybe Chronicle will ad a forum.  http://chronicle.com/forums/index.php/topic,156855.0.html 10) Might be better to make/request a ""child board"" 11) not sure if I understand the ""child board"" comment? 12) Child boards are sub-topics (and labeled as such in the forum). For example, under Job Seeking Experiences in the CHE forum, there is a ""child board"" for the Two-Body Problem. It is an odd appellation but one that is common in databases (Parent-Child Tables). My point was simply that you could add one of these under job hunting experiences. While I doubt you can simply add this, maybe the moderator can.  13) Oh, ok.  I posted need for a stem forum.  As usual, a lot of folks were confrontational or questioned its utility.  There are also forums on Science, and maybe those need to add academic forums.  Currently, they are limited to non-academic areas and they are definitely skewed to biotech.  I was just looking at them last night. 14) Yes I thought it was ironic that you posted a thread specifically for STEM people to chat, and a bunch of humanities people came and posted about how important their perspective is ;)  15) The first response by one was as useless as usual.  I was thinking of posting a question about what is the typical $ amount to expect for start up at an MS school and how would I best allocate the money.  Only reason is to see how many humanities folks have a clue! :) 16) Commenter #5 here: I warned you!  :)",I have had trouble finding jobs I am keeping tabs on on both the vacancies and filled list. I noticed names are being changed for some job postings. Tech glitch or poor editing? Just want to make people aware in case they cannot find listings. ,"cannot trust the job description anymore. It says one things, then they hire someone do another field... 2) Agreed. It is just difficult to know when it matters and when it doesn't 3) I just watched a job talk where you wouldn't have picked this candidate out of a thousand options if you went by the job ad, and you probably wouldn't have picked them even if they fit the ad. It's so frustrating to watch politics run the show when there are so many good scientists to choose from.","An offer gives you all the power?  Not so fast. If you have a minute to check/fix/update your AnonQuals, please do so.

I just learned that the committee is just meeting with the Provost's office. Ugh. Turtle much? 2) Realize that search committees lie all the time.  I can't tell you how many times I've heard 'we won't keep you hanging' or 'you'd be a great fit here' or 'we just loved your talk, you had so many great questions and your answers were fantastic' and so on. It's a psychopathic process. Once you realize and accept that, life is much easier. 3) sigh 4) SC member here, @2, your comment is a bit narrow-sighted.  We just had a search and 4 of the candidates were a great fit. Really. And we can't offer all 4!  So what are we supposed to do?  Or say?  And my flattering comments to a person ultimately deemed unhirable but who gave a fucking awesome seminar were in fact honest and sincere.  5) I second some of that - I'm not sure I've ever seen malicious or false praise for a job candidate; and I've never known any faculty interested in acting that way. I'd take the praise as genuine and remember that most faculty won't go out of their way to give unearned compliments. The ""you'll hear soon"" may not be true - just like your co-authors ""I'll have those revisions to you soon"" isn't precisely true either.  6) If the department or search committee chair says they will get back to you ""either way"" by a certain date, it would be nice to hear back within at least a week of that date (even if the comment is ""we're still deciding"" or ""there were delays"").","Wiki nearly dead? Seems like little action on the wiki? Did everyone get jobs but forget to post the details? 2) There has been much less updating, discussion, etc this year than either of the last two years (since I've been following the wiki). I wonder how much of it has to do with the competing bio wiki that split peoples attention this year. 3) The owner of the other bio wiki was probably an active participant last year but might not come round here. 4) A search for 'academic jobs wiki' leads you right to the other bio wiki, but it is difficult to find this page if you don't have it bookmarked. The other wiki format is so awful compared to this. Seems too late to do anything about it this year, but I hope that next year this type of wiki will be linked from the academic jobs wiki main page. 5) I agree, that other wiki is awful to use. 6) I hope next year I don't have to look at any wiki job page!","Such a rotten day in the office. Some day soon, I hope I am back here, posting my own job as a ""position open"" and wishing applicants all the very best with it! 2) I hope to do the same one day and write an essay about how dishonest and crappy the place is. 3) You may think your position is crappy, but if the position becomes ""open"", lots of people will apply for it. 4) Then they'll be naive like me and find themselves at the whim of their institution. Like the spate of tenure denials issued lately because faculty didn't bring in grant money. Those lines will be closed and adjuncts hired. Awesome times. 5) #1 again. I have an offer! 6) Congrats! Does this mean that your current position will be opening up? :) 7) Heh. Thanks. :) Probably, but not for 6-12 months.","Open access journals I think many of us are in the same boat for job apps - needing publications that are in reasonably good journals and having those publications out fast. I had one that went through a few different NPG journals with the recommendation to use their ""Scientific Reports"". Don't go there!!!! They are not fast (it has been going on six months now) and they are highly unprofessional (for instance, they held the paper up for a month because one of the co-authors is deceased and therefore doesn't have a working email address... somehow no one there could address this). There are so many for-profit open access journals for us to choose from, why go with one that makes your life miserable without cause? 2) I second the shade being thrown at Scientific Reports, as I also have a paper that has been stuck with a slow and incompetent editor since September. I will never submit to them again. 3) send your papers to society journals 4) I've never submitted there, but was asked to review a paper--it was a good ms, but the review process felt unnecessarily urgent, with 10 day turnaround and LOTS of reminders from ""manuscript administration"". Given that, I wonder where the hold up is! 5) Have a very low opinion of some of the research published in Scientific Reports. Got a paper from them to review, it was dire and suggested that it be rejected (with a full breakdown of the reasons why). Turned out the two other referees agreed. Journal suggested minor revisions. I also see regular spelling mistakes and just plain bad science in the stuff that gets published. 6) I agree with #3 that Society journals are a better place to hang the research hat.","I thought they liked me 3 weeks ago when I gave the interview.

It means absolutely nothing until the offer is made. ","post-interview thank you letters I recently interviewed for a position and would like to write thank you notes to folks I interacted with. How extensive should that list of people be? 1) Congrats on the interview. Send letters to everyone you talked to. If in doubt send the letter, a thank you letter is never looked at as a bad thing by anyone. 2) I sent a thank you to everyone who I had a meeting with, plus admin folks who handled my paperwork. I also tried to make sure I personalized the thank you letters even a little (e.g. ""I really enjoy yearing about your students work on...X""). I got lots of nice notes back and an offer. 1 again. @2 makes a good point I forgot to add. I also sent thank you notes to admin folks who coordinated my visit. I did not talk to them in person but communicated via email and it's very much appreciated to say thank you to them too. I recieved a few nice responses too but still waiting on the offer ;) 3) Are you talking physical letters or emails? I can't decide which I should use.   4) I only sent an email to either the search chair or my host, then asked them to pass on my thanks to the others.  If I had a meeting with someone who was particularly close to my field I might send a second/third note.   I think it might be weird to send 20 thank you notes to faculty who may not be very close to your line of work. 1 again, I don't think it's weird to send 20 thank you notes, particularly if the department is a small integrated one. If a faculty member that happens to be outside your field took 30-60 minutes out of their day to talk to you then I think they would appreciate the email.","We as a profession need to address the increasing disparity between salaries/etc at public R1s versus everyone else at public institutions. This is getting rediculous. I know someone will reply ""oh actually I got $400k startup and it was barely enough."" But you have no idea how low the salaries/startup are at other non-R1 institutions. The salaries at other places are downright exploitative for what we're expected to do, and forget about startup. States need to allocate more to the non-R1 public campuses or not have them. They have to stop this whole ""if you're at an R1 you're crazy rich, if you're at a non-R1 you're almost on food stamps"" system of allocating salaries for professors. I can already hear it -- the inevitable reply ""but you have to understand that professors at R1s get paid more because they're more valuable."" Weak. Don't we pretend to be at least somewhat progressive? Or should I be assigning my students Atlas Shrugged to read? 2) This brings up a broader issue, in my mind: why don't academics unionize more frequently to improve working conditions? Direct action gets the goods.x2 3) Some R1s have enough money to give out high startups. What are you asking for? R1 departments to give their money (earned from grants and donations) to other institutions?    4) One thing that CAN be addressed easily is the difference between professors and adjuncts or lecturers.  Often the salary is far lower even with very high course loads.  If you are in a position of power, push for better lecturer and adjunct pay.  I also wish there were more options between postdoc and professor so people could have stable research careers.  At the moment, the funding structure is at odds with lifetime researchers who are not professors. x5 5) There should be a pretty strong correlation between the amount of startup money a school provides and their expectations for research. If a school provides little to no startup funds, you are not going to be expected to publish 5 to 10 papers a year, but will be teaching more. How is that exploitative? Different schools have different focuses. 6) Yeah but getting paid less than a postdoc for any prof position at all is stright up ridiculous. x3  7) It's exploitative if you get paid $1000 per credit hour and zero benefits and the university receives $6,000-60,000 per credit hour that you teach. x3 7) Are we talking about TT professors getting paid that little or adjuncts here? I am fully with you that adjuncts are being exploited in this regard, but I think the original point was about TT positions. 8) Agree that R1 TT salaries are more reasonable, but still solidly middle-class; and if in a moderate to big city, still not an easy standard of living. Smaller schools tend to be in areas with lower cost of living (but not always). That does not excuse expoiting the overabundance of workers to pay as little as possible for our skilled labor. But pointing at R1 unis as the problem for this unfair situation is counterproductive. Education, learning and research is increasingly undervalued everywhere in the US. x2 9) It's unfair to accuse R1. The problem is not R1 unis.  Even in average R1s professors are underpaid. Startup is not salary. R1s and R2s should focus on improving the salaries of adjuncts and lecturers.10) Unions would be great except many states have made them illegal. Just look at Wisconsin.","Datasets on CV Does anyone include their dataset uploads on their CV? Like, not as separate publications, but just pub #1 info, then a line with the dryad doi or such? 2) Prof who's sat on a few faculty search committees here. Speaking purely personally, I don't want that information on your cv, it's just annoying clutter. It wouldn't help me evaluate your application for a faculty position. And I've never seen anyone put it on a cv. But if you did put it on there, it wouldn't be a big deal, it wouldn't negatively affect my evaluation of your application. 3) I have also been on search committees.  IMO, don't list data submissions. 4) What are thoughts on listing data papers as a separate contribution?  5) Ecological Archives contributions result in a corresponding Ecology paper, so I list that. 6) It's fine to list, but don't pretend it's the same as a peer-reviewed paper.  7) If it's a biggie (publishing the Simons Diversity Dataset or DGRP) then list it.  Only if it's a major resource that is widely used in your field.","Welp, had a Zoom interview yesterday with a committee who couldn't have looked more disengaged and disinterested if they tried. The vibe coming through the screen was so stonefaced that it was distracting and disheartening, to the point that my internal monologue had me wanting to ask them why they were wasting their time and mine. I've been on a number of search committees and I know the difference between ""we actually like this candidate"" and ""we need to interview X number of people to check HR boxes"" ... This was absolutely the latter. I've had more phone interviews than I can count over the last few years, and several campus interviews. There is such a clear difference between faculty and a committee who are invested and interested in you as a potential new hire and when they don't gaf. ... To add insult to injury, I realized this morning that the Zoom link they forwarded me contained the subject line that was clearly a last name. Of COURSE I googled. A very quick search of Last Name + Field led me to a profile for a scholar that is so clearly a better fit for the department and position. No wonder they were giving out the ""we've got our first choice already and you're not it"" vibe. The time stamp of the forwarded email also suggests that this person was interviewed before me, so again, having been on search committees previously, I know how hard it is to stay engaged and positive for interviewees when you've already interviewed your top choice(s) and they've not blown the phone interview and basically solidified your existing decision to keep them at the top of the list (ie invite them for campus interviews). SIGH. Just add this to the list of shitty interviews and get on with getting on. Thank god for this ecoevo venting page though. Sometimes you just gotta get it out. 2) I get that you are venting. However, you are pissed that people treated you poorly, then in the next sentence admitted you treated others the same way when the tables were turned. OP) No, I did not mean to suggest that in my time on searches I have given out this same vibe or treated candidates this way. What I meant to convey is that I get that it can be hard to stay engaged and positive, but *you manage* because it's disrespectful to do otherwise. It's that I've been on the committee side interviewing the candidate that probably isn't going any further and still been capable of being engaged in the interview. Knowing that it's tough but that it's 100% possible to do it anyway and knowing that it's (imo) unprofessional otherwise is part of why the interview experience was so frustrating. 3) Well.. perhaps the committee treated all candidates the same and you will get an on-site invite? 4) I had a crap-show of a Zoom interview last week, too. JIC gradschool & the job market weren't already enough of a gaslighting/emotional rollercoaster, it's nice to know that I'm not the only one who got blank stares/total lack of eye contact or any sign on interest from a Zoom interview. At least on phone interviews I can pretend in my own head that things are going well.",Junior researchers hit by coronavirus-triggered hiring freezes https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01656-3 2) https://www.cell.com/trends/genetics/fulltext/S0168-9525(20)30127-X?rss=yes
"shitty departments and unprofessionalism Disclaimer: This is just a rant, my rant. 
I'm fed up of crappy department SC's completely ignoring interviewees. When I say ignore, I mean not replying to simple emails, voicemails, and messages. WTF?! I know I shouldn't be surprised but it still pisses me off! Hell, if you don't want to answer my question, in the very least, acknowledge that you received my email/contact.  I'm generalizing this observation to crappy departments because in my experience (2 years on the market, >100 apps, 6 interviews), good departments treat their interviewees with decent respect and professionalism. It really is only the shitty departments that are down right SHITTY with prospective faculty too. Don't apply to shitty departments then , duh... 2) A lot of us apply to shitty departments. They might be shitty (for various reasons) but still stupidly expect to be treated with respect. Live and learn. That said, I've applied to some really good departments and still get the same silent treatment. Though, I've never had unanswered emails. That is pretty shitty.
3) If it looks like shit, smells like shit, it's probably shit. 
(4) In regards to #1 comment, well, sometimes (or often times) desperate situtations compel people to do depserate things.
5) I don't know what it is or what some of these inconsiderate sc's are thinking. They don't realize that the same candidates that they burn will at some point sit on grant panels. It's very difficult to give an unbiased review of a proposal from a grant applicant (s) from a department that is clearly dysfunctional, unprofessional, and for the lack of better words, SHITTY. Academic Politics...it is what it is...
(6) Wow, 5 I hope you never review any proposals. This is perhaps the most unprofessional comments I have yet. Seen, Not giving some one a fair shake at a department when they may not have even been on the SC, let alone, not being a fair and objective reviewer. Shame on you. You should seriously consider going to law school, being a scientist is not your thing. YOU ARE shitty! 
(7) I second #6.
(8) I second #5. It sometimes is very difficult to be try to be unbiased to colleagues that you know are jerks. Get your head out of your ass #6! This is a venting page. 
(9) Can we please stop this ad hominem thread? It's been a while since posts from this wiki have gone to the dark side. Just stop. 
(10) Seconded. 
11) 3rd'd (or shall I say turded). = humor :D (more humor= #10, instead of ""Seconded"", can say Number Two'ed) LOL
(12) The funniest thing about #5's comment is that someone who can't land a position seems to think that they will somehow end up on a grant panel! 
13) No, the funniest thing here is #11's comment. Hilarious!, sophomoric but funny as shit!!! LOL #11, you managed to make a whole lab (PI, 3 postdocs, 4 grad students, 2 undergrads, and 1 tech) crack up into a laughing fit!! 
(14) I ""number two"" 13's comment! 11 is funny! As for 12...harsh, but given some of the stats floating around around how many of us will ever be TT, probably true. 
15) If it's difficult to be unbiased ""to colleagues that you know are jerks"" then it is unethical to review a manuscript, grant proposal, etc., written by said colleagues. This is a clear COI (unless them being jerks in some way influences the quality or quantity of their scientific output, in which case perhaps you could take it into consideration). I realize that this is a serious point in a thread that had already turned silly, but I think it should still be said. By the way - thanks to #11 (seriously). 
16) Good point 15. I'll add that it's only a COI if the reviewer's interest is vengeance of some sort. Otherwise, I think 5's comment falls within your exception. Being from a ""clearly dysfunctional, unprofessional, etc."" department may indeed influence the quality and quantity of the their scientific output, thus making it valid to take into consideration yet difficult (not impossible) to judge a proposal, manuscript, etc. impartially. Let's move on.",general liberal arts school qualifications ,NA,NA,"despair I heard this week that the university where I had the best shot has offered the position to someone else. It was the perfect position for me. It was made for me, I felt. And when I visited, the feeling was mutual. I am beyond disappointed right now. Its complete disbelief, djection, denial and shock. I had a lot invested in this. I know this is not something a rational person would say, but I just want to go and off myself. If I did not have mouths to feed, I might have taken steps. The cost of this one has been incalculable. Yes, its just another position I did not get, but the human cost has been tremendous. My brusque and nervous manner has pissed off people around. My hair has turned grey and started to thin. On the nights that I do manage to sleep, I brux so badly that my dentition is getting fucked. Why am I enduring this? Why DO I have to endure this. I am a smart, loving, considerate and meticulous person. I have endured a lot.  But why are my peers and the system fucking with my head after I have poured everything into this. Fucking with my very livelihood, my sanity, and now endangering my life.  But please, please somebody tell me that this will end. I am not one of the dumb fucks to ask 'why me?', or to kill myself, but this madness has to end. I am unlikely to get sympathy for this on this forum, because I know many who are in the same boat. I am not a glutton for punishment, especially for sins i have not committed. What should I do to get out of this hole. Please help.  (b) When i went on the job market a couple years ago, I got a mouth guard because clenching/grinding was giving me major headaches (and I had a root canal). It works so well - I am headache free in the morning, a better way to start off the day! totally worth the $500 I spent on it. In terms of the other, mental stuff, it sucks and is a big roller coaster. So hard when something feels like such a good fit and then falls through. the only thing I can say is: realize it has nothing to do with you (if you are getting interviews, you have what it takes), so get through to the next season, take your disappointment and gear that energy to putting out a few more papers before the next round! good luck! 1) So, first of all, take a step back from your current reality. Yes, we are all fully invested in this, otherwise we wouldn't be on this career path. But no, this is not do-or-die. It is merely one career path, albeit an increasingly competitve one. I, too, have contemplated suicide recently after each on-campus interview has ended with rejection. You think, ""I can't take any more of this."" But in reality, you can. You just have to ask how committed you are to getting an academic job and staying in this line of employment. Is it the only thing you can do? Do you have other strengths? There is nothing you can do to ensure you nab a job (and I say this as someone just sitting here, waiting to hear about a decision I am sure will be another rejection). This is a stochastic process at best. I know, like many others on here, that getting interviews isn't enough. It doesn't give you any sense of accomplishment (which is fucked in its own right). So do I have any advice? Yes. Your kids/partner would be devastated if you weren't in their lives. They are proud of you. And you have to pull yourself up by your bootstraps and bite down hard if you really want to get a job. This is... the hardest thing I have ever gone through. And the reason I didn't commit suicide is because I have come to peace with the fact that the odds are against me. And when I figured that out, I also made peace with the fact that I may be able to leave academia and work in the produce department of a grocery store... and still have a completely fulfilling life. Failure is a construct outside yourself. Change that by realizing that your life can be much better without being in academia. No, you can't have the false sense of prestige that publications and grants can bring to someone, but you can have a fulfilling life where you can be emotionally and physically available for your kids and partner. Academia does not afford that in most cases. So cherish what the options are that come with being outside of this really fucked up career path. Solidarity. I will be checking this if you want to continue venting. You are loved. 2) Dear #1, thank you for your nice words. I wish I could be healed, but I am very broken. You seem like a really nice person and I hope you get your job ASAP. Nice things need to happen to nice people. As for leaving academia - i cant bear to think of it. I cant. I just cant. The thing is, my work helps this world, helps people and saves lives. I can't imagine anything I would rather be doing. This is fulfilling to me. I just want to  get on with it. This job search is a distraction - I just want to keep working and making progress. So just give me the fucking job already. The irony is that my humanity is getting stripped and defiled even as my work is humanitarian. My problems are minor compared to those of the poor devils dying out there of wretched conditions, but still, I too deserve to have one less thing to worry about. My family certainly does.  3) To the OP: I understand the feelings. I am sure that they are felt by a lot of people at our stage in their career. I have too thought that it would be easier to end it at times (even planning it a bit). I have spent 6 years in postdoc with a number of interviews but no offers and have felt pretty worthless at times. However, you need to realize that you are setting-up a dichotomy that is irrational and troubling. You are bascially saying that have to either an academic job (and thus benefiting humanity -- I understand that) OR you will committ suicide and leave a wake of devestation for your family that will be felt for decades. Either you get a job you deserve or you will destroy your kids' lives. There are innumerable ways to make a difference in the world. I think too often people get stuck in a box and feel there is nothing outside of academia...this simply isn't true...even for you (I am not saying you won't get an academic job either). It helped me a ton to see a therapist who helped pull me out of a downward, myopic spiral that has taking a serious toll on me, my family and my work. I urge you to contact a professional...you at least owe that to your family. 4) #1 here again. OP, I understand everything you’re saying. I feel the frustration and the agony of this entire process. I also agree that talking to a professional is the best idea right now. I had suicidal thoughts for the first time when I was finishing my PhD because my postdoc opportunity fell through right before I defended. I came out okay, but I decided to go to a therapist because I was seriously planning to end my life. What the therapist helped me realize was that, as I said above, failure is a construct outside myself. Other people had created expectations of me and for me, and as much as I thought I had chosen these things for myself, it was the system that had created a false sense of identity for me. Yes, you are a scientist. Yes, you have accomplished things. Yes, you do things that matter. But at the end of the day, what is going to be more important to you when your time comes? The moment before you check out, is it more important that you have done your best as a parent and a spouse? That you have treated other people well and been humane and compassionate? Or is it more important that you got that third paper in Science or, hell, even won a Nobel? If you think the latter is going to matter on your deathbed, let me be the first to tell you that you are mistaken. What matters is what you do for others and what you have done for the people who care most about you. If you create a cure or save a species from extinction, they will never thank you. But your family is thankful for you every day… and they always will be. Please try not to lose sight of that. You are loved, and love matters more than science. It always will. 5) I have suffered long-term unemployment due to a combination of circumstantial and personal reasons, and was out of a job for about three years since my last postdoc funding ended. A unique situation I am in more or less prohibited me from seeking alternative careers unrelated to my training (e.g. working in a grocery store). And I didn't want to consider non-academic careers, not only for some of the grandiose reasons, but also simply because I don't know how to do anything outside of academia, given how long I have been doing what I'm doing. I've had suicidal thoughts many times during this period, and it didn't help that I am single, so I didn't have any of those ""you have your family to live for"" comforts to avoid it. However, one thing I never stopped doing was continued trying, applying for everything possible, even though I didn't believe I could attain anything any more towards the end. I finally caught my break late last year when the Smithsonian fellowship I applied for came through. I know my battle is far from over, but I'm at least back on the right track with the fellowship. I think my story is an example of how good things can happen if you hang in there long enough. OP, I would suggest you not to over-think about anything and just keep doing everything within your ability towards your goal. Rejections are the norm in academic job hunting and even job hunting in general. Don't take them too personally and just move on. But keep doing what you think you need to do if you know that academia and science are truly your passion. Happy endings are possible. 6.)  Good luck and God bless us all.  7)  More like God save us all.  ;) 8) I have read a book on science and career. One analogy the book used is that doing science is like ants marching, and it is absolutely a group effort, and not individual type. I'm in the edge of debate now to go to industry or continue on applying academia, then I face the jobless situation after one more week. My life and thoughts are in a tornado phase right now...and I try to use positive psycology to medicate myself. 9) Since the Ed.D.s took control of academia it has gone downhill.  ","Nothing is better than verbally agreeing to an academic position and then the contract arrives with something completely different! The assumption on the other end is that now I am hooked and have nothing else.  The Dean has said that they will ""try"" to get some of the other things taken care of....but we can't put that into the contract.  I feel like I am getting my first glimpse behind the curtain and it is not good.  Anyone else had this happen?  I'd like to make this work, but they are not making it easy.  1) I agree this sucks, but it could be that what you thought was verbally agreed to, wasn't.  It's easy for details to be misinterpretted in phone calls, which is why you shouldn't take a verbal offer for much.  Was the verbal agreement made with the same party that sent the letter? 2) I'm very sorry to hear this, it doesn't sound like a fun situation, especially when you should be celebrating (and congratulations!).  First, you need to figure out if this situation came about from malice, incompetence, or is simply the result of a miscommunication.  Based on your description alone, it's probably some combination of the first two.  I'm guessing the things that changed aren't dealbreakers, but it certainly sounds like it's making you less excited about your new job.  Who is your advocate there?  If you're working with the Dean on the negotiations and things aren't going well, I think you should speak with the departmental or search chair who hired you.  They should be your advocate in this situation.  If you don't make any progress there then you may be right; there's nothing you can do without giving up the job.  If that's the case, I think the best advice (assuming you have no other offers) is to take the job, go and do the best work that you can, knowing that this will give you the most power to a) renogotiate when your contract/tenure comes up or b) move on to another position if you really just have peeked behind the curtain.  It's also possible that you'll take the job and everything will be great, and this will be nothing more than a minor hiccup in your past. 3) DO NOT EXPECT ANYTHING THAT IS NOT IN WRITING. All of this ""our hands are tied as far as the document goes but you can trust us"" stuff is bullshit. The resources will at least be worse than what they refuse to put in writing. The teaching load will be at least higher than what they refuse to put in writing. Expect it and make peace with it or turn down the job. 4) I agree with #3 and that is why I turned the position down.  The contract was nowhere close to what I verbally committed to and they were unwilling to include anything else.  Other opportunities will pop up based on my track record, so I am passing! 5) #3 here. They are only required to honor what is written in the formal, signed document, so they can screw you up to the limits of that document. They don't have to honor anything assured to you via conversations, emails, pinky swears, sacred promises dabbed on parchment in their own blood, etc. (6) I had a few things I absolutely wanted in the contract and stuck to those (including stuff the U usually didn't put into contracts, but that I have seen folks screwed on). Got everything I verbally agreed to and would have been offended had i received something different than what I agreed to, so sorry that happened to you, it sucks! 7) this sucks!  I've heard several deans are not negotiating in good faith this year. (6) weird, i wonder why? ","There is a lot of misinformation on here from people who don't seem to have much interview experience. I will leave it at that. Take what you read with a fucking massive grain of salt. 2) Agreed. 3) Yeah, b/c 1 and 2's experiences are the only experiences that matter. ",anon quals Who deleted all the Clemson job postings?? 2) Probably the same person/people who changed the PhD dates on the AnonQuals page and keep sorting the pages (or partial pages) by random columns. This wiki is a case study in tragedy of the commons. OP - thanks to whomever put them back. I'm glad the commons can keep the tragedy in check. 3) This whole academic job market is the tragedy of the postdocs.,I'm really pissed that there's no one venting yet. UGH.,"negotiations LET'S ADD TO THE NEGOTIATIONS. IT REALLY HELPS OTHERS! Please contibute to the negotiations worksheet if you can... it is harder than it looks and I could use the info! 2) I've found last year's doc helpful https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wt09-Oo2jDDvrAGI11lb-Mb2YY9TaLeOuAY9TG4lDbs/edit?pli=1#gid=0 1 again) Thanks! (3) Just got rolled in my negotiation because I wasn't prepared to talk turkey. Do your homework as soon as you have a campus interview go well. 4) Sorry to hear that. Would you mind providing any details that don't compromise your anonymity? How'd it happen? What to avoid? 5) and where did you get hit the hardest? startup, salary, or other? 6) why would they give you a bad package when they made you a faculty position offer?        I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT ONLY SEVEN PEOPLE FULLY NEGOTIATED POSTIONS....but indeed there are only seven entries.  And yet, I know 4 of those entries, and I don't know very many people. Come on folks, the neogitation info is really helpful to people out there, and can help redress gender bias in salary and start up. Let's empower the information revolution! (3 again) Offer phone call with head turned into call from dean a few mins later turned into verbal negotiations mid-adrenaline spike. Don't want to overstate things: Being ready would have gotten me like 5-10% more, not 20%+ more. 5 again) I was lucky that I got an email from the dean to schedule the phone call, so I had 24 hours to pull myself together and ask for advice from mentors. But I would echo the advice that you should do your homework early. I went to my interviews with a rough startup list to know what ballpark I needed, which allowed me to judge whether or not the schools had enough space and startup for me. If you're looking at public schools, look at the publicly available salary databases as soon as possible too. 6) If salary info isn't available online, it might available be at the campus library. 7) I was lucky that the dept chair told me the estimated start up and salary during my exit interview. They also asked for a start-up list immediately. It might be worth asking the chair about estimates during your exit interview at the end. 8) The negotiations page is pretty interesting; lots of variation.  ","I quit.  x3 2) I can't afford to quit, otherwise, I would x2 3) I applied for an industry job yesterday and today I'm appling to a lab tech job... so maybe I gave up too.4) #3, if you get offers on both, take the industry job. There's no career ladder for lab techs and a lot of crap flies their way.x3 5) Depends on what kind of lab tech. There are some lab technician jobs that offer a career ladder. A good example is in the pathology industry. 6) Don't give up yet, I know some folks who took 4-5 application cycles before they got a position, and some of them are in R1s now. 7) Don't give up? I think about all the work, all the moving around, all the years of 60-80 work weeks it took me to build a CV with 20 publications by the time I got my PhD., and I'm not even competitive on the job market right now because search committees scan my CV for the words 'Science' or 'Nature' and then toss it aside. What else can I do? Put in another 5 years of 60-80 hour weeks, give up all personal life, and hope that someone eventually hires me by the time I'm 40? No thanks, I'll take my chances elsewhere. I'd rather be a delivery driver. I can earn the same salary either way. 8) Leaving academia is not a failure. Everyone here is bright, driven and intelligent. Sometimes the intelligent decision is to choose another path. Industry and govt. careers, teaching careers, NGO work... all can be just as rewarding and meaningful as academia. 9) I hate to say it #7, if you think you aren't getting job offers because of the lack of a Nature/Science paper, you have a poor understanding of the job market and where you stand. To put it in perspective, I have been on around 10 search committees (7 masters level/3 R1) and have only seen someone get hired with a Science/Nature paper on one occasion, and it was the masters level school! 10) #9 is right. I've been on 4 x R1SCs. If I were using a points system, it might be 3 points for publication record, 2 for funding record, 6 for research and teaching fit, 3 for communication skills and 3 for interpersonal skills and leadership potential. A Science or Nature paper would only affect where you sit on the 0-3 point scale for publications. 0 points would be a deal-breaker, but 3 won't guarrantee you do better overall than someone who scores 1. 11) I might also add, a lot of times Nature/Science authorship by graduate students and post-docs are from the work of a PI. A search committee is left to decide if that manuscript is representative of future Nature/Science papers from the applicant or if it is a one-off from being in the right place at the right time. Personally, I would rate a first authored paper by an applicant in the journal Ecology or Evolution higher than a middle authorship Nature/Science paper. The first authored Ecology or Evolution paper is a better predictor of future success by the applicant, in my opinion. 12) I agree - considering the politics involved in getting a paper in Nature, Science or PNAS, it's unlikely that a postdoc would have landed that paper on their own, making it a question whether they could pull it off again. 13) Eh, I've been told by a search chair that the reason I was in top 10 but not top 6 was lack of 1st/last author glamour publications (even though I have 1st author papers in journals with higher IFs than PNAS). Do I think a 1st author Science paper means anything? Nope, but some people use it as a criterion. 14) #12 - As 1st author on a PNAS paper from my PhD work & co-author on a Science paper that was first-authored by a fellow PhD student, I object to your assertions. We ""landed those papers"" ourselves. The research was novel and completely different from our advisors' work (different systems, study organisms, questions, & methods). We came up with the funding for those projects on our own & wrote the papers ourselves, with editing by coauthors (including advisors). I wonder how many SCs ignored my solid CV because they assumed my ""glamour"" pubs were not my own work?  15) think of it this way, if your advisor was on the glam paper and you are still coauthoring papers with him/her during your pre-tenure phase, you won't be considered an indepenent 16) I think #12 is ignoring the politics - of course your work can be novel but unless you are on the radar screen of Science/Nature/PNAS and not in a lab of a big name OR at an Ivy, your chances of getting your novel work published there is very, very low. Editors of these journals will even tell you this up front that their decisions are based on market and poltiics not the science, hence that 24 hour review period. 16) #14, sometimes I think that people who apply for jobs think that they are applying for jobs in a vacuum. I'm sure your CV was not ignored, but is it possible that there were other candidates with more high impact pubs and more first-authored mid-impact pubs? Remember, you aren't competing with yourself. There are lots of good applicants out there. It sounds like you are on a good trajectory to eventually land a R1 job. Keep at it and you will eventually get the call from the bullpen. To put things in perspective, the last R1 search committee I was on, there was an applicant with 5 PNAS papers (a couple first authored), one science, and one first authored Nature paper. The candidate also already secured over $1 million dollars in funding. This candidate was not coming from a post-doc, but was applying from another R1! Just remember, once you start applying for R1 jobs, you aren't just competing against graduate students and post-docs; you are also competing against R1, SLAC, and M/L faculty who want a better position. 17) Could I have some more man-splaining, please, #16? ""Remember, you aren't competing with yourself"" was a real gem, as was mentioning that faculty apply for jobs sometimes. x3 18) Just trying to make a point that often times you won't get a job offer/interviews b/c there are simply better candidates. It seems that most applicants like to assume that they didn't get a job b/c of an internal candidate or some other specific reason (possibly b/c an application was overlooked b/c ""glamour"" pubs might not be entirely the work of an applicant). Sorry if I'm man-splaining more. I'm sure zero search committees ignored your solid CV b/c they assumed your ""glamour"" pubs were not your own work. Maybe one of your letter writers wrote that you are a loose canon and commonly assumes the world is out to get you. See, I can make up reasons why you didn't get an interview/job offer too.   19)  Very nice #17, playing the sex/gender card.  I didn't see anything sexist in what #16 said, and frankly it could be a woman for all we know.  We need to rid science of the assumption of sexism just as much as actual sexism. (x2) 20) Women can be sexists too, even toward other women. 20) Is Godwin's Law still a thing? Shall we skip straight to it? 21) It is clear that the second coming of Hitler is in this conversation. 22) #17 here, not the OP, btw. Mansplaining: ""to explain something to someone, typically a man to woman, in a manner regarded as condescending or patronizing."" Both of your posts are just that (except I'm a dude) -  so if the the shoe fits you,  wear it. No need to invoke Hitler, just pointing out some condescending, obvious, unhelpful comments. If someone wants to vent, let them do so without offering comments that are (frankly) dumb and completely obvious. It's the venting page. OP, your position sucks, it just flat out sucks. There aren't enough jobs to go around, and it makes things really hard. Here's wishing you the best with whatever you decide to do. 23) #22, ""There aren't enough jobs to go around, and it makes things really hard. Here's wishing you the best with whatever you decide to do."" That statement was dumb and completely obvious. Quit ""man-splaining."" 22) It's called responding appropriately to a colleague going through a sh***y time. Dispensing condescending ""advice"" is one thing - letting someone vent and telling them they're justified in feeling that way is different. 23) Academia seems to be full of condescending twerps","Bad connection during phone interview is the last thing you need; (2) it is odd, I posted a question here - After such a call, how to send out the thank you emails if I am not sure of all the six committee members? though I totally agree that it was the last thing I needed:-) 3) send it to the seaech chair.  4) thanks, done that! Surpisingly, in some places I neve gathered who actually was on the search committee. oh well.","The wait, I can't stand the wait.  Why can't they even give you a little bit of a heads up on whether or not you're going to get the offer after they've met to make the decision?   I feel like if they know that you are going to get the offer that they can give you some kind of informal/unoffcial heads up or some kind of code that it's all OK and if not, can't they do the same for those not getting the offer.  Don't they know I'm a high stress kinda individual? x2  2)  OP again.  Dept Chair told me today, that it'll be a FEW WEEKS.  The search committee met last Thursday to discuss the 3 candidates that interviewed, so not sure what's taking them 3 weeks, but they've dragged everything about this search out, as it took them a month to phone interview everyone's references back in Dec.  The other option is that someone is sitting on an offer, but no one has noted that on the Faculty Jobs tab as of yet and I know all three the folks that interviewed have beein updating it. 3) I once applied for a job at an R1, got invited for an interview 3 months later, actually interviewed 2 months after that (the last interview), and then found out I didn't get the position 2.5 months later. Some SCs and dept's are just super slow. 4) Id guess someone is sitting on an offer.... Im currentluy sitting on an offer while I wait to hear back from another interview I had. It'll be two weeks before I know, so I'm dragging it out. Everyone is in the loop on both SCs, but I havent updated the job listing on the wiki either. 5) @4 WTF what reason would you have to not update the wiki? Looks like dick move to take the time to comment on someone else's rant about the wait, just to say that you won't update the job listing. x4  6)  Yes, please update the job listing #4.  I think it would help to take some uncertainty away from others that are stressing out over it.x100  7) Admin here. @4, yes, please update the wiki, as user input is pretty much the only thing that we rely upon. 8) Late to the party here, but ""the wait"" never bothered me. Unless I had a better offer and needed an answer ""now"" I don't care and anything but a firm ""no"" was fine.","invitation after offer from another place I have received an offer from a place I like. But, they are taking the negotiation pretty slow, and I haven't signed anything yet. Meanwhile, I receive an on-campus interview from a place I don't like that much. I am tempted to go in case the negotiation with the first place doesn't work out, but if I say yes and they book the flight and in the meanwhile I conclude the negotiation, I am obligated to go to an interview for a place I already know I won't ever work. Any advice? Should I rush the first place? I am worried that by rushing I would get less than I have asked. 2) I was in the same situation. I considered myself a 'free agent' until the paperwork was signed, so go, interview and if you get two offers you can use that in your negotiation with the place you prefer. Negotiations fall apart all the time, so you'd be silly not to bet hedge by going to the second interview. 3) Don't quit the hunt until a contract is signed. 4) Worse case scenario, all you do is add a line on your CV ""Invited talk at Uni X"". But maybe it will be better than you think - I've been in that situation. 4) so you would potentially ""lead on"" a Skyping search committee even if you are waiting for a contract to sign in the mail? This is a situation I find myself in. 5) It's not leading them on if you don't have everything signed. This happens all the time with searches, and though it may feel weird, it's what you have to do to protect yourself. By all means, let them know when everything is really, truly official, but until then, you owe it to yourself to not be left hanging. 6) Also, search committees 'lead on' candidates in phone interviews all the time when they already have a pretty clear idea of who they plan to invite to campus. 7) #6, thats not true. x2 8) @7, certainly not true for all searches. But it is fairly common to give phone interviews to 10-15 candidates when there is a very strong likelihood that only the top 5-6 on the list have a realistic chance of getting a campus invite barring major mistakes. You can debate exactly how common it is, but I've seen it happen enough to know it isn't rare. 9) Don't we all know that is the point of Skype interviews? A great chance for someone to move up the short list and bump off a top-fiver.","So. Dang. Tired. x4 2) Yeah! After I get a batch of applications submitted I don't have much motivation for my ""real"" job... 3) I am both tired of applying, tired of searching and tired of thinking I got this only to see it go to someone else :( 4) Yeah. I am at the point of having an existential crisis about the meaning of it all.... why do we do this to ourselves? 5) OP here--I feel ya #4. It's been a few weeks since hearing anything and it just....stinks. 6) Notice a distinct uptick on the venting tab on a Friday afternoon. No coincidence there 7) Check out the new industry post at the top, it's exploding with enthusiasm! 8) Yep.

The game is so damn exhausting...",Number formatting Can a moderator edit the format of the numbers in the salary and startup columns of the negotiations sheet so that they have comma separators and are thereby easier to read? 2) How's that? AP,"Received an email that the short list would be selected soon. One HOUR later I received the rejection. So fast, much wow. 2) Rejections suck but at least they were responsive. I was told I would hear back after phone interview by the end of the week, that was a month ago and still crickets. Common complaint here but the lack of communicationa and follow through is so annoying 3) Have also been in the place of #2. Asked a faculty mentor about it and the response was basically along the lines of some committees will wait until the ink is dry on their new hire docs before they give the rejection to their short list candidates because they want to be sure they have a pool to go back to if their top choice (or two) don't pan out. Sucks to have to wait, but at least that's one possible perspective for what's going on. ","teaching vs research responsibility What is the normal % of teaching vs research load at a R1 institution? 2) Usually between 1.5-2 classes per year, though on a semester system (2-3 classes per year on a quarter system). There is some admin type work, and the rest is research. x2 3) To add to that answer, many schools have 1 substantial undergrad course in one semester, and a lighter seminar or grad course in the other semester. 4) I teach a 2:1 here. In the semester with two courses, I'm actually teaching a lecture and the accompanying lab. "
"Spring Break Contact Do SC's contact post interview candidates during spring break?  (1) Yours or theirs? I choose to believe they don't, because I didn't hear from anybody last week. (2) this is funny to me that you think that after undergrad, spring break exists for either faculty, postdocs or grad students. (3) Maybe not for some, but I can guarantee that some faculty that I am waiting on to do various things are on break and make no attempt to conceal it.  (4) My post-doc adviser, faculty who shares the lab, department head in department I am negotiating with, and director of related center are all on vacation/field work abroad right now.  And more power to them!  I should have taken a vacation too....  life is too short (all R/H universities, BTW).","U Northern Colorado Has Animal Biologist position been offered to a 2nd candidate???

How long will that be for the result of phone interview? I have sent one email to ask, but don't want to be annoyed...  1) One e-mail is too many. The committee should tell you at the end of your phone interview when to expect to hear something (or not). If they didn't say or you didn't ask I would not contact them. Just keep checking the wiki. Good luck. 2) I agree, no emails...they will get ahold of you if they want you. (3) It took over a month for me to get contacted for a campus interview after a phone interview last time. I have never recieved feedback at the end of my phone interview regarding when or whether to expect future contact. 4)To 3...Take the opportunity to ask next time. I cannot images a SC not answering the question (even in vague terms). I've done 6+ phone interviews over the years and all of them told me without asking. But they all asked me if I had any questions for them. That is when you pull the trigger.5) OP here, thanks a lot for your input!","If a position has been filled (offer accepted), can we remove this position from the vacancies sheet? so we can try to organize it better 1) I don't see why not.  Anyone object? 2) yes, I do!  It helps to see what was offered over the whole year. Oh wait, I guess there's a filled vacancies page. So just move it over there? 3) OP here...so I will remove the filled ones to the other spreadsheet (filled vacancies) as much as I can... thanks!","I don't see any point to this at all unless it's to be supportive of one another.  So if you feel compelled to be an asshole, live with your own insecurities and don't feel you need to share them. 2) well said. 3) Actually I find that some of the harsh words here are useful. Sometimes they knock some reality back into me. 1b)  Interesting.  (And not being a smartass.) Personally, I don't need that kind of help.4) Harsh words are sometimes needed. Really, some people should get a bit more common sense. The reality is that we are trying to compete for positions now and money later. so some kind of a reality check is not such a bad thing.  ","Anon Quals page An option for submitting proposals if you are not associated with another organization, or you are not wanting your current place to get their fingers on your grant.

Why the hell did I go through all those years at the Tuber Academy? ,"Affiliation A friend of mine has been unemployed for 6 months now (his postdoc funding ran out in August), and we are wondering if his lack of affiliation is hurting him get an interview and ultimately a job. Last year his CV was ca 6 papers shorter, but he was at least invited to interviews. This year - silence, despite better CV. Can lack of affiliation be that damaging? 1) It does but its not damning if they've done well before. I got four interviews on no affiliation. None of them converted into the job I wanted, even if I did get one offer. 2) Not sure it would be that damaging, but it could hurt him somewhat. If possible, one strategy might be to try and obtain some sort of affiliate status before the postdoc terminates. OP) Thanks! Coincidentally, things have started moving for him this week. So perhaps not a big deal afterwards.","Do you ever feel like SCs have their preferred candidate already selected before the on-campus interviews? 2) I've been on a few SCs. I usually have a view on who will be best before we get to face-to-face interviews, but I'm only right about half the time. Interviews matter a lot.3) I've had the feeling that the decision has been made when I'm one of the last candidates to interview. 4) I was recently the last of three to interview, and definitely got the feeling that the department had already decided; was not a very pleasant experience 5) I was #3 out of #4 and I could totally tell that the department had already decided, I felt like it was a total waste of my time. They didn't even ask me anything about myself, which told me it was pointless. I agree, it was not a pleasant experience at all. 6) 6) Interesting points #3-#5. I hadn't thought much about this until a recent interview where I was last. A few people in that department told me they think it's *best* to go last, as you're then fresh in folks' minds. That's a good point too, I think. Something to think about! 7) #4 again; I've also had the experience of going last and it being a fantastic experience, and being told half-way through that I was likely to be made an offer. There are just so many variables, it's hard to say what interview slot is ideal 8) did you get the offer? I've had the feeling after going last, too, but didn't get the offer. In fact, after observing who got the offer, it became clear that they had made their decision already, so it felt like a big farce. 9) I did get the offer, and I turned it down ... and I sometimes find myself regretting that decision -- especially when it's almost March and I don't have anything lined up after summer.  10) so why did hyou turn it down, if I may ask? 11) My family was unenthusiastic about the location, the salary and start-up were lower than what I envisioned, and I still had plenty of time left on my postdoc 10 here) #11 thanks for sharing your thoughts 12) I have felt this way so many times. 13) Although it's professional behavior, I have always found it odd when search committees thank you for making the time to make the interview. As if it were an altruistic act.  14) The SC puts a lot of time and effort into the search, and they also know their candidates are quite busy, so they are likely genuinely appreciative that their choices come out for an interview.  Personally, I've gone to a few interviews to places that I wasn't entirely ""sold on"" or sure i'd want to live...  some weren't the best use of my time, but others really changed my view of the location, department, and university.  So I can see why SC would be thankful when their candidates actually make it out for the interview. 15) In my experience, the search committee will usually rank the top candidates before interview offers - so, in a sense, there is a favorite; however in all searches on which I have served but one (that is, about 5/6) the 'favorite' candidate before the interviews was not the favorite afterwards. In one instance, we nearly didn't even offer an interview slot (one of five!) to the search candidate who ended up being the overwhelming favorite after interviewing! (In the end, she didn't take the offer - but nonetheless.)","Phone interview questions I have a phone interview coming up; would anyonebe kind enough to share some of the typical questions they've been asked by the search committee? 2) See the links page for lots of tips. But for example: what funding avenues would you persue? Who here would you collaborate with? What courses would you teach? What attracts you to the position? What do you know about our school? Which paper are you most proud of, and why? What experience do you have working with [industry/government/low SES students/indigenous students]? 3) I had 6 phone interviews this year, every one of them asked me about why I thought I was a good fit for this job and what facilities I would need to do research.  4) How is your teaching innovative?   5) Make sure you have at least a couple of questions to ask them at the end.  Anything from grad program to other plans to hire across the school or core facilities on campus.  Keep it research focused, IMO. 6) What about at a teaching-focused institution? Is it better to ask questions more-focused on teaching vs. research? 7) Yes, at teaching focused places ask about support for teaching, and turn your question around so it focuses on the students. In general, questions you ask let the committee know where your priorities lie. If you are interviewing for an undergraduate focused/student service focused institution ask about their students!","My postdoc years are easily my least favorite years. 2) same. 3) Agree. In many ways I think it is made worse by the fact that it could be a really enjoyable time if I wasn't constantly stressed about the future of my family, career, etc. x5. 4) Best and worst, all at the same time. I feel more engaged than ever, but at the same time, so much more stressed. X3 4) Agree.  Had been told it was the best time in an acadmic's career path but I found it incredibly stressful with all the uncertainty about the future (fellowship/grant proposals to keep myself funded as well as trying to find a permanent job). x2 5) it depends so much on whom you work with... 6) agree with 5. I also benefited immensely from having a 3 year fellowship so I had at least a bit of room to breathe and enjoy 7) uncertainty is terrible, considering childhood friends who made more traditional career choices (even those requiring very little education) have clear roads to retirement. I think it got better as my five-year postdoc went on, mostly pissed about non-independence, inability to start new projects unrelated to mentor lab, and relative lack of benefits from the institution. Bottom line, postdoc sucks if you have kids, less suck without kids FOR SURE. 8) Agree 7, I found it really nice to have young kids as a late stage grad student, but as a postdoc it has been very hard especially now that they are at elementary school age and the prospect of moving and where to live with them really constrains thinking about job/postdoc prospects. I love the place where I am, my PI, my postdoc in general, but the uncertainty about my kids (and also partner needing to find a job) is so stressful and continuous that it makes it hard to really enjoy. 9) 8-maybe it's just the age of the kids?  I had a baby as a postdoc and besides the insane cost of daycare, it's been pretty great. I can imagine things getting more complicated when they are school age though 10) @ 9, yes I think it is mostly about the age of the kids. Now that they have established friends/teachers, etc, it is a lot more stressful to think about moving them somewhere else that we may not like as much and where we may not have great schools, etc. 11) no argument that it does sound like sucky with kids, but postdoc also sucks a LOT if you are single. you have ZERO financial safety net if your funding runs out, and no one to help. and every time you move is starting from complete scratch (at least with a partner, you have one person to talk to in a new place). tl;dr postdoc sucks. x3 12) @11 yes - as someone who has a hard to solve two body problem, I think it's actually better than having a one body problem, e.g. I don't worry about whether potential places to move would be a good place to meet someone, etc, and my partner has had a consistent job with health insurance that has allowed me to have a lot more flexibility in funding 13) one of the postdocs with kids here who complained above - certainly no judgement from me against those postdocs without kids, we are all in the same boat and it is hard. I just hope everybody ends up with some stability, it's really important in life. x2","how long is negotiation? I had a verbal offer almost 2 weeks ago. No written offer yet, I provided the sturtup list and asked a position for my partner. None has been in contact since last week. Is that normal to take long time for this process? Should I be worried they turn the offer off since I have seen nothing written? 2) Dont' want to freak you out, but yes, two weeks is an awful long time for zero communication. Negotiations can take awhile, especially if you are seeking spousal employment, but the chair/head or dean should be in contact with you regularly. Keep in mind, this is a two way street. They should also be concerned that they could lose you! I would call them. 3) I agree with #2. I had a complicated negotiation process, with a spousal hire, visa sponsorship, etc. It took about 4 weeks to get to an agreement but I was getting emails every 3-4 days with updates, counter offers, etc. I'd definitely contact them again. 4) did you get an update? 5) We're getting worried, OP, what's the story? 6) OP here. They have been in contact. It seems they are not able to meet many of my needs, including partner hire. I like that place, I had only one offer and little desperate to find a job after too many years in the market. But, they are turning me little off. It seems they don't move from the initial package, which is not the greatest ever. 7) If you can make it work without a spousal hire, I'd say take it and immediately go back on the market. Blow your start-up to get some good work done quickly and then say sayonara. 8) I am exactly in the same position and my plan is to do exactly what 7 suggested. Its not idea, and its kind of a dick move, but...im doing what I have to do. 9) It's not a dick move at all. It's just a job. People get hired and leave for new jobs all the time. But yes, some faculty members take it personally when a candidate leaves quickly, and this may be construed as negative when interviewing for a new job immediately after accepting another. However, I'm sure if you are open about why you want to leave, no one will hold it against you, or at least they shouldn't. I've never understood why academics are often held to some higher level of committment for a job over people in the business world. My friends in the business world change jobs every year, and honestly, big businesses invest wayyyy more money in their executive employees than universities ever invest in junior academics. 10) the dick move is not accomodating your partner. 11) OP Here. Mostly, the dick move is not clearly saying they are not accomodating my partner. They are vague but push me to sign. Then, they disappear, making me think they are pissed, then appear again with no news. Negative responses are way better than vague responses. 12) That's really frustrated. I had to push HARD to get everything in writing. Literally everything. Too many people get screwed who took components of the verbal offer as part of the official offer. 13) If you're going to jump ship, that's perfectly fine with me. But if you're not being honest with your current/incoming grad students about it, that may qualify as an even bigger dick move. (Not assuming anyone wouldn't be honest - just had friends who got that end of it.)","1) What would be your response when after final day of campus interview at R1 for this TT job (research/teaching) before saying Good Bye the search committee chair says: ""If you don't get the job, atleast we can meet at the conferences.""? Faced this during my campus interview & still struggling. What would ya respond? BTW, didn't get the job. 2) ""Cool, thanks, hope to see you around."" It could be a sincere statement on the chair's part, it's not like they make the decision.3) This stuff is awkward. They probably meant it well and it may not even mean you aren't getting the job. Believe me that's better than what a lot of search chairs do. Let's at least hope it means you are on the list of candidates they will consider hiring, regardless of rank. 4) Don't worry. In my experience they will pretend like they don't know you at conferences. x3 (so true) 5) One of those statements they need to train SC members not to say!","indication of position being filled Is there any chance moderators or others could use a fill or text color in the Faulty jobs tab for positions that have offers already accepted? Would save a ton of time sorting. 2) We moderators don't have time for that, but if someone else wants to, go for it! AP ","I'm happy for a community here of people going through the same issues during a rough job search. I've often found myself appreciating the thoughts, insights, and perspectives of others. I can't help but feel like I'm in direct competition with people applying to the same jobs as me. It's to the point where I'm happy when people hear nothing or negative news on a position I've applied for and bitter when people have success in all jobs. Recently, my partner begun to recognize when the search process and its associated stress and constant anxiety has been hitting me hard that. In essence, this job search has changed me as a person, not for the better. And a primary concern I have is that if I do get a job, the changes to my personality may not be reverted. Anyway I just wanted to vent. Thanks for reading. 2) I think you become more aware of the reality of academia in every sense. Knowing more is good, but what you learn is not heartening. It is a business, and the majority of professors are cheap commodities that justify the influx of free government loan money via unprepared students. Students that may never be able to pay their loans back, taught by professors who may be in the same financial situation. Your personality and attitude shouldn't come back from learning this information. You can, however, use this information to make a difference in your life and in the world. How you do it, is up to you. 3) ""Venting"" tab... ""I'm happy..."" Hey just what the heck is going on here? 4) OP, I hear you and feel the same way, but I really appreciate (2)'s perspective. In fact, talking to folks who do have jobs, they feel similarly to you. Not sure if that is any solace. Further, as (2) points out, learning that our main springboard for socio-economic mobility (i.e. education) is this disfunctional has had good implications to how I choose to spend my time.

"Just a vent about waiting and this wiki... I seriously need to get out and do some extended field work, away from a computer, the internet, and this damned wiki! Everyone is moaning on and on about waiting to hear from SC's. I'm in that boat too. I thought I had an idea of how long this was going to take. I am dead wrong. there's no end in sight. Sadly, even though I feel I totally rocked a couple of interviews, waiting around with no sign or contact from the search committee tells me I'm most likely not getting an offer this year. But, still I wait and hope fades each day. In the mean time, I'm fixated and paralyzed by this awful wiki. It's definitely a love-HATE relationship. This is just my vent. I don't mean to stir up controversy. I'm a nice person! wah! : ( 1) Field work is an excellent remedy! I was out in a pond this week listening to the sounds of southeastern chorus frogs. It took my mind off of unemployment for the day :) More importantly, it reminded me why I do what I do, ya know what I'm sayin' 2) Field work is great! I posted the other other day in the rant about not hearing from SC's. Then I went into the field to set up a new experiment and had positive thoughts again..... I really feel sorry for the modelers that can't do that ;) (3) True, however modelers can get drunk in the middle of the day ;-) (4) The assumption that fieldworkers can't get drunk in the middle of the day shows that 3 has never done any fieldwork ;-) 5) I hear ya OP! Fixated and paralyzed describe my relationship with this wiki. I'd love to be in the field right now. BTW, I agree with you #4. Beer and field work go hand in hand and I wouldn't have in it any other way (don't tell NSF that!). Unfortunately, I can't easily get out and do field work; my field sites are in the Caribbean. All I could do is get drunk and walk around with a clip board and measuring tape around campus pretending to collect some kind of data. Seriously though, this wiki has got a hold on me. I'm tempted to unplug my ethernet cable though or go somewhere that charges for WiFi. I check this wiki about 20 times a day all in hopes of any nugget of info on my pending positions. I've got the post-interview limbo bluessssss! (6) #3 here - in my experience, drunkeness usually happens in the field around 6 pm :-D (7) 4 here.  Depending how the experiment is progressing (raccoons like to trash my stuff and ruin days of backbreaking labor overnight), I may be drunk by midmorning ;)  Although maybe I shouldn't broadcast that... (8) #3 here again - you need any help with your field work?  ;-)  I learned how to create anti-raccoon protectors for Shermans, so perhaps I could help. (9) I have a solution to the frequent checking phenomena. We could all agree to only post updates at 5:00 pm Eastern Time. That way, there would be no updates and no point in checking until 5 each day! Just a thought... :) 10) Great idea!!... in theory.

Ouch!  Sorry to hear that. 2) I've been there. It sucks, but consider the fact that you made it that far, you'll get there again. 3) feel brave enough to say where? Just curious what part of the country a University still has funding issues. 4) Sorry :( Was it a private or public uni?  5) sorry to hear this.  i know its small solice, but you did win the battle, so you will again.  You might consider talking to the search chair or whomever, about remaining the candidate should $$ come forward next year.  some schools will do this, some won't.  6) it could be worse.  You could have been given the job in the place where you always wanted to live only to discover it was the last place you want to visit, let alone live!  7) Was this a private school? I'm in the same boat. Was told they wanted to bring me in, but are in a hiring freeze and may not be able to offer the position after all. Great place, great department. Just waiting to see if dept chair can get approval from the school admin. 8) ask if they would be willing to delay the position until next year, assuming money became available you would be willing to wait.  They may bite at the offer so they don't have to go through the search again. 7) This would work for me, except my postdoc contract is up now and I will be doing temporary work to get me through the spring for peanuts.  So I can't really wait.  Fortunately I have interest from other schools... just not as great of schools, pay or start-up. I'm optimistic though, since they need to fill these 2-3 position due to retirements and accredidation requirements.8) I realized this might be the case, but its better to be unemployed for a year with something in your back pocket than no future in sight. 7) Excactly, either way I am optimistic and will definitely pursue a year delay, if nothing else works out for me.

A position I applied for, was 're-advertised' and previous applicants ""need not reapply"". I had my letters requested from this school, but never heard anything except for the search chair asking me to fill out the equal opportunities fact sheet. Speculations as to what this means for the position and the search? Sounds like they didn't get any qualified applicants (in their mind). Sorry to be harsh. I'm guessing it's rare, but it happends. 2) a few years back I was interviewed for 2-3 jobs that all went unfilled.  In fact, I have interviewed for a lot of jobs that were NEVER filled. 3) I think that happens frequently when administration has a different idea what the department needs.  4) mostly, its been budgetary in my personal experience.  The school advertises, then while in the interview someone tells you they are not sure if they will get the $$.  Then, you never hear anything, the position does not get filled.  Four years later, its still not filled.  It has happened to me several times! :) (5) sometimes they make an offer to the first person, negotiation, that person declines...they go to the second, same thing happens...maybe they aren't happy with the third, and by the time all this happens they might as well just reopen the search. So, not necessarily a product of not any qualified applicants, but maybe a reflection on the fact that a few people are getting many offers and negotiations take a long time. could be you need not reapply because they are putting your application back in the pool?","fuck shit fuck shit fuck shit fuck department behind the scenes politics fuck! 2) yea. happened to me as well 3) same here 4) Politics meaning what?  Politics is the art of consensus-building, so I sure hope that this was part of what the hiring department was doing (but I am sorry that it didn't work out in your favor). 5) uh, did I write this?  Yeah, happened to me too.  Chopped off at the knees for sure.  But in my case something better almost immediately came up and I am waiting on the contract now.  Really hope the better outcome turns up for you ASAP!",Applying to work with friends or acquaintances 1) New salary information from the Chronicle of Higher Education: http://chronicle.com/article/Median-Salaries-of-Tenured-and/228435/  2) Thanks! This is helpful,I want that potato job !!!!!  (2) That post is immortal. Makes me laugh every time I think about it.,"Chalk talks Does anyone have any advice on chalk talks?  I've read a few blogs/articles about them but I'm curious if anyone here has any advice. 2) Chalk talks can be very institution-specific. The best thing I feel that I did was talk to the search chair and committee members in advance! They have always been willing to answer my questions -- remember that it's in *everyone's* best interests for you to give ""the right"" talk. Things I asked were, ""Is it an actual chalkboard/whiteboard talk, or do people usually bring powerpoint slides?"" ""How interactive are you as an audience -- will it be more of a discussion or a presentation?"" ""Who is likely to attend?"" ""What have candidates done in the past that was seen as successful (or not so much)?"" In my experience with R1s, I've been told to be prepared to describe 2-3 research proposals that I'd be writing in the first couple years of my position; I use ideas/projects that I have a more thorough grasp of (so that I am well prepared to answer questions about funding sources, methodological details, collaborators, etc.). I spend the first few minutes recapping my general research approach/interests, then dive into the first proposal -- Each time it has turned more into a conversation/discussion -- I find them really fun!! OP) Thanks so much! This is great advice :) 4) On the other hand, and maybe I just diid a poor job, with the one chalk talk I have given there was very little discussion. In my case, I got the feeling that the committee didn't have any expectation re. the structure and format of the talk.  5) Chalk talks vary a lot.  One they wanted me to talk big picture, the other I got grilled on tractability, and another very little was said and questions sounded canned.  Ask the search chair but don't be surprised if they say one thing and it goes a different way.  This is really their one chance to figure out how much you know vs how much your advisor did.  It can be a lot like quals both in variability and intensity.  Ask if they want you to comment on more than research (teaching, advisor style, collaboration style, service in the field).  I found passing out an outline helps people follow along better.  Definitely do that. 6) I concur with 5 - they can be quite variable. Usually it will mostly be faculty attending, but grad students/postdocs will also show up often so they get the opportunity to see what they are like. Usually they are forward looking (what will your next proposal(s) be) and some faculty like to grill you in them. I hate them - definitely lost any possibility of on offer on one that turned into a grilling session. Make sure you emphasize the importance of the work (think broader impacts) before getting into the nuts & bolts of the hypothesis/conceptual approach. Also, be sure that you know where this proposal is going (not just ""NSF"" - but what division/panel) - you may get asked this, they want to know that you are somewhat savvy to the system. OP here) the chalk talk is right after my seminar *ugh*.  I e-mailed the SCC and they said to have an outline of the research that I will be doing pre-tenure.  They also want me to prepare a teaching proposal.  I'm guessing this is what classes that I want to teach? Right? 2 again) That would be my guess re: teaching proposal. Is this something you deliver to them beforehand, or part of the chalk talk? I might ask whether that's supposed to be a proposal of types of courses, or a proposed syllabus -- or if it's some internal ""term"" could you see some examples. OP here) The chalk had absolutely no structure.  I prepared an outline of proposed research and classes I'm interested in teaching, but we really didn't get through much.  Most of the time I was asked questions that I had answered already in the Skype or in meetings with various faculty so it wasn't too bad.  It felt akin to a dissertation defense but at a faculty level. ","I tried everything that people here suggested to dress and act older on an interview, and I felt like I nailed it, but that didn't stop a post-doc from saying ""Wow, you look so young! How old are you?"" 2) I am unavoidably young looking, and a woman, and there is NOTHING I can do about it. I dress very formally for interviews (not a full suit, but well matched 'seperates' (jacket, pants, collared shirt). At my last interview, the SC joked around when I got carded. But at the same time, people comment positively on my high energy and ability to connect with undergraduates. You should not fret about looking older, there's nothing you can do about it, but you can use it to your advantage. 3) I look very young as well - I'm also short and female if it matters.  I wear suits and boots with heels, which I feel does not help at all. I did have a search committee chair comment on how I'm too young to remember something (I can't remember verbatim what he said but he was only ~6 years older than me) and I jokingly responded with, ""well, I'm not as young as I look!"" I think that looking young can be a disadvantage but I try to be mature with regards to my ideas, mannerisms, and attitude, which has worked because I have received offers.  4) Take heart - I personallly feel the age bias is against older applicants. When you are young you are described as being ""full of eneregy"" or ""fresh"". When you are young, people can pin their hopes to you... 5) I also look young for my age, and I also got carded in front of committee members when out to dinner!  It was embarrassing, but I just tried to act professional and be the authority that I am in my field. I tried to remind people I took time off between college and grad school, therefore - I can't be that young!! 6) #5 - Why do you have to tell them that you ""can't be that young?"" Isn't it possible for a 28 year old to land an R1 TT job? 7) I know we discussed a lot about this issue, but I-- as a woman-- am always confused about women who are worried about being too young, and am wondering what are the ages they refer to. I know a ton of people landing a R1 job between 28-32, and one or two even younger. ","How to interpret communications during search process The University of Maine at Farmington has a document on their website listing the template for letters sent at various stages, along with an explanation of under what circumstances they go to each type of candidate: http://www2.umf.maine.edu/hr/wp-content/uploads/sites/81/2012/04/Sample-Letters-to-Candidates1.pdf 2) I know one of their searches failed--I wonder what the form letter is for that circumstance? 3) face-palm emoji?  ","From chair while negotiating: ""If we had known about your spouse during the interview, it would have been easier to arrange a position for them."" Ugh. 1) but they aren't supposed to ask about marital status...  Sorry about the situation. Congrats on the offer though! 2) Bullsxxt! If they had known, they would have offered the job to someone else x5. 3) I (female) actually made a point to bring up my spouse who would need accomodation (not research though) at the advice of many folks who had been on SCs and said that they, too, were blindsided by late information regarding spouse. Luckily place I told was very supportive and, hopefully, doesn't count it against me. 4) Can someone who has served on SCs (or maybe #3) explain how it helps the committee to know about spouses prior to deciding who will get the offer (besides using this information to axe those with academic spouses)? 5) 3 here. People who gave me that advice, who served as chairs/dept heads, said spousal hires require higher up admins at my institution, so going to admins early to start the process before the second visit increases odds it works out. 6)  I've been on many SCs and have chaired one.  We can't ask about this, but you can volunteer the info.  I've heard of it hurting candidates in the past and other times not.  It's not something we even think about dealing with until we know who we want to make the offer to and then we try our best to accommodate the potential new hire. 7) I know #2 already said it, but total fucking bullshit. They are just trying to shift the blame for (possibly) not being able to come up with something. They may have still given you the offer if you had disclosed, but I would not ever risk it. @3/5, I agree it may make sense for a second visit, but the initial post seems to reference the first campus interview. OP) Yes, it was in reference to first campus visit. there was no second visit. I have myself gotten conflicting advice on what to do, but the majority of people (including professors and SC members) advise not to disclose a spousal hire until the offer is made. The rationale being that it cannot benefit you in any way, but can potentially hurt you a lot. 8) Member of R1-tenured academic couple here. There is truth to both sides. The search committee can't make an extra position and neither can random faculty members, so there's no need to volunteer info to them. The only person who needs to know is the department chair, who can indeed start laying the groundwork for a spousal hire (true in our case).  I'd keep your requirements vague with the dept chair unless you have an absolutely non-negotiable demand. Just let the dept chair know you have an academic partner in field X, offer to send their CV, and say that you hope to arrive at a mutually agreeable outcome if you're made an offer. Basically, the same approach you'd use for startup requirements. Anyhow, you can safely assume that someone in the department knows about your partner, but that doesn't mean everyone does, so you have to don't bring it up with anyone unless you want to. In our case, we were coming from one TT and one soft money position and everyone already knew our situation, so there was no point hiding it. In a given search, having an academic partner can work for or against you, depending on an individual's predisposition to want you (or your partner) as a colleague. In our case, it helped. This is all contingent on the institution's capacity to make an extra position, but you can't do anything about that. #6's experience as a SC member is the same as ours. We try to hire the best people and let the admins worry about closing the deal. Hope it works out for yall. 9) @8, I think your advice is more applicable when the couple is in the same field and potentially the same department, no? No department sees it as an advantage to find a spousal position for another department, especially one in another college across campus.... (member of R1 tenured and tenure-track couple here) 8) @9 Good point, our situation maybe not be universally applicable. I still think giving the chair a heads up can save some time later on, but that might be less important and saving it for the negotiations phase might be equivalent. I'd say around half of our new hires involve spousal accomodations of some sort, so the department chair won't be too surprised when they find out. 10) So if anyone from SC reading, do you look up candidates on social media? You can often see if a person has a partner. It is hard to get blindsided with the amount of information online. So, is it something that is commonly done?   11) I've been at universities that had official spousal hire programs.  The hiring dept informs the dean/provost/chancellor's office that they need a spousal hire for the candidate. The partner's CV is sent to the appropriate dept.  The CV is compared to the most recent list of job candidates on open searches.   If the recipient dept says yes, they pay 1/3, the original hiring dept (Bio) pays 1/3 and the university office pays 1/3.  Or 50/50 at another school.   The problem is that all of this takes time, which increases the chances you will turn them down and they lose the chance to land qualified candidates if you do.  ""You should have told us earlier"" is blame shifting.  It's difficult to see what it would solve except to move the process faster if they knew you would be the hire.  But how could they know that you were the hire before all interviews are over?  Starting a spousal hire process while interviews are still happening would be an HR flag.   I strongly suspect that statement is code for we would not have hired you if we had known.  But your experience with them may convince you otherwise.  12) @ 10, I've been on several SCs and this never came up, but there was an article in tCoHE or IHE that discussed this very topic. As I recall, a research project was studying some aspect of search committees and one thing they reported was how SC members openly looked at social media accounts, talked about spouses, etc. Does anyone remember this? I've tried searching, but can't seem to find it... 13) During dinner at one of my on-campus interviews, the chair of the SC explicitly mentioned looking me up on social media. Weird for sure. 14) It's not necessarily your job to help the university get your offer done faster. It's your job to get the offer (and then work with the university, in a reasonable way, to get what you need). From that perspective, I can see no benefit to alerting anyone to the need for a spousal hire at the interview. It could be neutral or negative, but I have a hard time seeing any positive in it. The possible exception is if your spouse is well known, but in that case, the university likely knows already. Super lame move, OP, on the part of the chair.  15) It's not complicated, people. If not getting a spousal hire is a deal-breaker for you, then tell the chair about it during the search.  If they knock you out of the running because of your request, that's fine: that means they weren't going to give your partner a spousal hire, so you weren't going to take the position anyway. x216) @15, the offer may still be useful for negotiating elsewhere, even if it is a deal-breaker... 17) Totally disagree 15. Places where a spousal hire is possible but not standard are much more likely to go out of their way to make it happen after an offer is in place. Telling them ahead of time makes it so much easier to just rank you one spot lower to avoid the hassle, consciously or not. I hope (and think) that many SCs would not do that, but some might and it is hard enough to find two jobs that I don't know why you would ever risk it. x4 ","second visit dress code Anyone have thoughts about whether dress for a second (post-offer) visit needs to be as formal as an interview? My normal attire is more REI catalog than slacks and blazers - is somewhere in between appropriate? 2) Chacos and blazer. Sounds awesome. x2  3) I went with less formal, but still formal for me - black trousers and sweaters (no blazers) 3) How about this philosophy: Wear whatever you would plan to wear when you give a deparmental seminar, participate in faculty meeting, or meet potential students. 4) I dressed nice (a couple nice but not formal cotton dresses) but didn't wear clothes nearly as formal as I did for the interview (a suit dress one day and slacks with a blazer the other). 5) Hey #2, do you agree with me that Chacos can be considered ""dress Chacos"" if they are clean and have black straps? 6) #2 here. Yeah. As long as it's a grey or navy blazer. Or, the pattern can match your tie. Seriously - If, as in my current department, faculty often wear jeans/sneakers, Chacos, trousers, dress shirt/blouse seems like it would come across as professional. I'm not faculty, however. "," Almost 2 months after the phone interview when you see that the HR's application portal shows ""Interviewed, Not Advanced"" - ugh!! Here goes another year with unproductive applications.","Contacting search committee? I thought I would have heard back from a particular university by now, but I have not heard anything and there are no updates for the job on this document. When is it appropriate to contact the search chair? Is it even worth doing so? 2) Contact them. 3) as long as its brief and polite I don't think it can hurt, especially if it has been several weeks. 4) Leave them alone and move on.  5) Contacting them and it was helpful. Thank you all 6) Hope you updated the Faculty Jobs page! (x2) 7) Lol, you expect to hear back? Such a rarity ","This wiki has turned into a general biology job board 2) I don't think it's quite that bad, but it's to the point that ecologists should start their own separate wiki next year  3) Please don't! I agree the scope has gotten a bit broader every year, but it honestly isn't all that hard to scroll past the jobs you aren't interested in. I've been on here long enough to remember the year that two different wikis got started and it was not an improvement. I just appreciate that almost every job I'd be interested in gets posted on here so I don't have to worry about digging through every other job source. x46  4) I've been on this board since 2011.  It hasn't become broader.  And every couple years there's a suggestion that ""pure"" ecology should get its own wiki, what are all these scummy Organismal Biologists even doing on here diluting the Ecology jobs. Once you get a job and join an EE department, those same ""pure"" ecologists are the ones questioning why our department even has faculty that teachs a dead field like vertebrate anatomy. I mean, who even takes that class? 5) I once found out through the grapevine that I got rejected after an interview because some people in the department didn't think genomics is actually science. Maybe the ""pure"" ecologists should get their own island. 6) maybe if we got tenure by just sequencing random shit and publishing it, we could afford an island 7) #5 here. Sure, I also have a secret ""do bioinformatics"" script hidden away that does all the work (I don't do anything remotely similar to sequencing stuff and fishing around for hits). It was a genomics search, by the way. 8) I'll bite even though I think the original comment was in jest. Who even takes vertebrate anatomy? the premed students keeping the department afloat. And aren't taxonomy and organismal traits somewhat important for ecology? 9) This is ecoEVO jobs. Evolutionary biology (which IMO can include all of genomics, anatomy/organismal biology, and taxonomy) is part of the name. 10) Just call it the Population Biology job board and be done with it! 11) Ecology should definitely start its own board next year. There are neuro, cell bio and human phys jobs listed here now. 12) I posted one of the non eco-evo jobs on this board as a committee member…  clearly got some of our best applicants from here, and I’m guessing most all of them wouldn’t have seen the ad otherwise.  Lots of us can fit into a lot of different roles, so I think it’s better to be broad than narrow (as it looks like everyone in #3 agrees with). 13) You forgot the anthropology ads that showed up this year 14) @13 while there are many jobs here that I feel comfortable applying to as a biological anthropologist, rest assured we are still happily hoarding our limited number of bioanth jobs on our own wiki... none of the anthro-specific jobs are making it to this board 14) There was one already 15) also, paleontology? gtho  16) I mean what does paleontology have to do with evolution, amirite? 17) On a job interview I literally had faculty tell me DNA had nothing to do with evolution.  18) @17 WUT 19) I'd much rather have too many jobs on here than not enough. I think it's fine the way it is. x2 20) Agree with 19 (and others), almost every job I see on here is one that I could see filled by someone with an eco and/or evo background, so given that our fields are so large and intersect with so many others, I'd also rather have a broad job board. x8 21) seems like seeing more jobs is better - is it that hard to scroll through the jobs that don't apply? 22) If it wasn't, there would be only one academic job board for all disciplines x5 23) It's fine the way it is, I mean, it's not like people are posting quantum physics or english literature jobs on here, everything seems to be eco-evo related. x16 23) Isn't every biology job a little bit about evolution if ""nothing makes sense except in the light of evolution""? :-P 24) Righto, i just apply to everything and my cover letter says ""I am qualified for this job because I study evolution and nothing makes sense except in the light of evolution."" 25) @24 LOL x2 25) @5 @6 How widespread are these views that people doing genomics aren't conducting real science and are just 'sequencing random things and publishing it'? Does this arise, at least partially, from genomics folks hogging the high impact publications over the past decade? I mean, yeah, some people do this (arguably this is done will all sorts of data), but do people judge you for working in genomics nowadays? 26) @25, Maybe the attitude comes from actually reading these ""high-impact"" genomic papers? 27) So true 26 but if 25 can sequence my stuff and make an ordination plot from it they are cool with me. You got significant differences from 2 million reads? You don't say! As long as the graph is going into my proposal :)","Anon Quals Wrapup We're getting close to the end of the season, so if you want to update your Anon Quals entry with the final stats, now'd be a good time. -- AP"
"REJECTED Lots of rejections this weekend. So sorry to all of you. It truly sucks. I called the sc and was rejected that way this weekend.   The position was ideal and I think I was the best fit. I guess the sc disagrees, obviously. Depression has set in, feelings of inadequacy, despair, and disappointment are all filling my head. I hate that I let myself get excited about this position. From coming up with a start-up figure (imagining my lab), scoping out housing, envisioning collaborations, to imagining life in a new city, I set myself up for this crash. Life goes on but man, it sucks. I wish I had never been invited to interview. The rejection after that phase stings much more than a first cut elimination. ouch! (1) That sucks. Remember, don't take it personally. SCs make decisions for all sorts of weird reasons. Hang in there! 2) That you got an interview means you were good enough to get the job and not getting it may have more to do with what they need taught, some research initiative they may have in the off-ing, or just randomness. It's so hard when you like a place but it's not a comment on your qualifications. If you got an interview, you'll get others, and you'll get an offer somewhere that may feel even better. Have a nice dinner, buy some good wine, do something to celebrate the triumph of getting an interview. Good luck!
3) Wow #2, your consoling comments make me feel better and, I'm not even the OP. Thanks! It's very refreshing to read some nice and positive comments on here. I think this dire job market has brought out the worst in people on this wiki. Anyways, I know EXACTLY how you feel OP, it's even possible we got rejected for the same position. I found out on on here. Someone posted that the position was offered. I felt great about the interview and given my other rejections this last school was my last hope for anything this season. Like you, I thought I was a good fit and got the clear impression from the SC that I was their top candidate. I too envisioned everything from the phone call offer to my first grant proposal. The department is so-so but I thought I could fit in. The biggest hurdle for me was the ""lone ecologist"" factor which has gotten much attention this year on the wiki. Even before I found out I was not their pick, I struggled with the notion of being the only vertebrate ecologist in a hard core bench discipline department. In a way, I'm relieved that I didn't get the offer. I was really torn with the possibility of having to decide to either accept a position that I would probably leave or staying in my postdoc or doing another until a better position opened up. Given the state of the market, I was ready to accept anything. Anyways, I completely agree with #2. It's ok to mourn for a day or two but, hang in there, celebrate your interview, and don't take it personally. Chances are that you will get an offer from a better school next year. Cheers!
4) I hear ya OP, keep chuggin, and stay positive. Seriously, kudos to you for having received a campus interview! Some of us, myself included, haven't even gotten the chance to interview on the phone. Just read some of these sad stories from your fellow job seekers. It's very very nasty out there and the fact that you were even considered for a position speaks highly of you. I don't know you but I'll put money on the prediction that you'll get more interviews and maybe an offer next season. Good Luck and Congrats!
5) I'm with ya OP and others. I too called the search chair and was notified that the position was offered to another candidate. They were meaning to let the others know soon (give me a friggin break!). It stings! I'm out this year. This was my last possibility. I totally empathize with you; I'm on the verge of depression as well, not so much from the simple rejection but from my own burned expectations. I also let my enthusiasm get carried away with dreams of FINALLY running my own lab and and FINALLY getting some payoff to the hard work I've put in. Now, I have no disillusions of easy street as a TT prof but, this is what we're all striving for. Well, for now all that is on hold till maybe next year. It's ok to feel like crap and it's ok to despair, I'm in the thick of it right this minute. But, you're right, life does go on and we have to stay positive. Think about it this way, there are probably dozens of other Ph.D.'s going through the same thing, you're not the first and your not the only one. We can get over this. Let's hang in there, get buzzed, and say, ""Screw it, THEY lost out."" HERE'S ONE FOR ALL THE REJECTS! *slams back 4th shot of Sauza* 6) Hold on your 3 ahead of me! 
7) Rejection sucks big time. But give it a few days and you'll feel much better about it. Get busy, keep collecting data, submit those manuscripts, and prep for next season.
8) I feel like I was set up on a blind date with someone. I googled them, did some snooping, and before even meeting them, a spark developed. Then, we talked some on the phone, got to feel each other out a bit. The spark grew even more. Then we set a date. I'm nervous. What do I wear? Should I buy something? I need a haircut. Then we go on our date and we hit it off! Love at first sight! Sparks fly, dinner and a movie and I even got invited for some ""coffee"" afterwards, yay!. This is great! I have FINALLY met someone! No more dating, no more lonely nights. I can't wait to hear back from my date. I'm thinking this is love. Yes, I'm in love. I'm thinking marriage, yes marriage! I can see it now, a little house with a white picket fence, and kids. Oh, our kids will be perfect! I can't wait!! Then a few days go by, no call. Then a week, nothing. A couple of weeks, nada! boo hoo! 6 weeks go by and I see my date out and about with another. What!, they just got married!!! NOOOO!!! I am crushed!!! How will I move on! I am crushed! I banish love! AHHHHH! :(
(9) Love it #8. Summed it up perfectly. Been down that road (academically, of course). (10) ROFL @ #8. (11) love#8
12) Love it too #8. Too bad there's not an ""EEB-Harmony"" (w/ 9 dimensions of compatibility!) for us.;) *It may have helped prevent the debacle over at UOP. yikes! 
(10) Just got a rejection from a place where I declined the interview!  Seems like the same thing as sending out application withdrawals for every place that rejected me.
11) That sucks #10. Funny though. Good luck!
(12)  Actually, #10, it sounds like, ""NO!!  You didn't reject US, we rejected YOU!!! SO THERE!!"".  In fact, it seems common - most people I know who decline an interview or withdraw their application seem to get a rejection letter, even if no other applicant does.","Job Market Now that it's almost all over, how do you think this job market compared to last year's? Do we have any hope for a better situation next year? (OP) Despite the higher number of offerings, lower number of cancellations, and greater success getting interviews (but not jobs), this year was worse for me. There were fewer positions offered in my specialty at desirable schools. (1) In the current lousy job market, some compromises are needed to land a TT position. The intersection of a desirable school plus specialty is just too rare (and competitive). 2) I'm out this year and have no hopes of the job market getting better next year. I'm ashamed of my failure this year. So many applications, two interviews, some near perfect fits, yet nothing. I know I'm one of the ""lucky"" ones to have even gotten a couple of interviews but, it still stings. (3) I'm with two. This year sucked in a lot of ways. I have a very strong record, and applied to ~20 places, many of which seemed to have been written just for me, but I only got one interview at an undesirable place. I hope next year is better, but given the continuing state budget cuts and rampant deficits, I doubt it will be. (4) Everything is relative I guess, last year was a total bust for me (a single on-campus interview), this year I had to turn down two campus interview requests because I had so many. Multiple offers, selected the one with the highest pay in the best location. Cast your net widely (people who apply to less than 20 jobs are doomed), gather as much teaching experience in as many subjects as you can (and LEARN HOW TO TEACH), then apply to anything within your realm of ability. (5) I agree with 4. I applied for anything I thought I could convince the SC I could do. What I discovered on my campus interviews is that most if not all of the faculty have taught something they had no experience with, and they all had faith that I could do the same. If you fit with the dept, the job description doesn't necessarily matter as much, so don't eliminate yourself by not applying. Let the SC earn its money and rule you out if they think you can't do it. Good luck! 6) @4 and 5, thanks for sharing your experiences and for the great advice! I've taken #5's approach and have interviewed for two positions that I didn't think my applications would even get a second glance. I didn't get offers but the experience of interviewing was fun. 7) Similar situation as #6 but I would not use the word ""fun"" to describe my interviewing experience. My interviews sucked and the weeks/months of waiting for my rejections sucked even more. Like #2, I'm out for this year and have no hope that next year will be better.8) I'm out too and not sure I can go another round. 9) 48 applications, 0 phone interviews, 0 campus interviews, 30-something rejections (some schools have accepted offers and still no rejection!); I'm finished for this season and am looking for another postdoc or money for my current one. *sigh* 10) Ouch #9! I thought I had it bad. Last year, I wasn't too serious about applying and got skunked however, I only sent in 7 applications. This year I got one campus interview out of 29 applications and I'm still waiting for the final decision. I'm not desperate because I have postdoc funding for a another year but, like others here, I have no hopes that the upcoming job market will be better than this year. (11) Sorry #9 for using your case as a negative example, but your story made me feel a little better about my own (just slightly). And it lends evidence to my belief that it's more than random chance/luck when it comes to applying for academic jobs.",NA,NA,"sex with search chair I had sex with the search chair at my recent interview. We're both married. We were both drunk. I don't really care if I get the job, but all signs point to yes. Just putting it out here (lol). I'm sure I'm not the only one to have this experience.  ` 1) impressive if real. are you male or female? 2) What the what? Why is infidelity impressive #1??  Also, you joke about this as a good thing, but, in my opinion, you've totaly destroyed this being a good job for you, as if you get the job, you will essentially be working with someone you had an affair with and it will either be awkward or you will continue the affair, so you're deciding to either throw away your current relationship or be in a very weird work environment.  The only redemption here is to remove yourself from the search, but given that you had the affair to begin with, perhaps, you don't value your current relationship very much, so fuck it and see what happens.  I just know this is not something I would ever do to my wife, drunk or not drunk. 3) Fairly convinced this is fake.  I mean I believed the sex part but he/she lost me at ""don't care if I get the job"".  Pfffft, yeah right! 4) @OP, I don't know whether your post is a fake or not, but I do know that this type of incident is not so uncommon. I served on a search committee in grad school and a similiar incident happened between a non-tenured faculty member and a candidate.  Eventually everyone found out about it.  A big mess.  5) I had the distinct feeling one of the search committee members was hitting on me in one interview process.  It gave me the heebeejeebees.  I'm a guy, and frankly, i did not like it.  I was there for professional reasons, and here you have this chick prof getting blitzed and being more forward than I care to have someone be when on one of these things. 6) EEB progams are rife with postdoc+prof relations, grad student+prof relations, prof+prof (cheating), and your story is of no surprise. For the sake of your spouse, I hope you don't get the job. 7) Wow! I wish my interviews were more like yours. Your story turned me on! Way to go! 8) what the heck...what kind of search chair is that? Do EEB people get drunk a lot?! 9) Are you kidding #8! Have you ever been to an Evolution or Ecology meeting? It's a drunken, chest puffing, ass grabbing fest. I'm not surprised OP. 10) Egads! Are you sure this was a department chair and not a sleazy hollywood producer? Was his office decorated with leopard prints? I mean, my god. 11) See, this is exactly what's wrong with academia. We see ourselves as progressive and liberated, but the attitudes, and the stuff that goes on, are sometimes straight out of Mad Men. 12) This kind of *stuff* is not uncommon.  The PI (married) whose lab I am in is having an affair a with new Assistant prof  (single) who was hired last year.  They met during her interview. 13) Sleazy! 14) My department is highly disfunctional, but happy they're not sleeping around (that I know of).  15) I'm glad no-one in one department I worked at were in bed together, they were already living evidence that birth control, and even abortion might be a good thing. 16) Holy crap, I haven't gotten laid in months!  I'd love to get some and a ""job"" to boot! You gotta tell us where this is. 17) My interviews have been the most boring events. I wouldn't mind some spice like what you describe (minus the infidelity you douchebag!) 18) I've had sex with colleagues, every year I hook up with a few at conferences.  But scoring some on an interview...wow! Bravo!  You got me aiming high for my interview next month.  There are some hotties in that department, from faculty, postdocs, to undergrads! 19) I'm convinced the original post is fake. There is no time for sex on a job interview. There's barely time to sleep. 20) OP here, update: I was offered the position and accepted. Awkward! 21) Good for you.  In this market you do what you gotta do. I only wish opportunities like yours were more common.  I'd be first in line, I've been postdoc'ing for 5 years now.  22) I would SO sleep my way to the top. Of course, I would need to ask my wife first. She would be probably be ok with it if it would get us out of this postdoc.","I recently came across a junior faculty's CV, which listed his/her failed NSF grant application as a co-PI under the Research Funding section. It was noted as ""not awarded"". Is this a new trend of listing just to show that you have grant-writing experience? And does it do any good with SC's? 1) don't need to list failed proposals...2) One SC member here: I don't mind seeing them. Tells you that if s/he is not funded, its at least not for lack of trying. In my experience faculty who wrote tons of proposals as grad students and postdocs (even if not funded) pass on that culture to their students. Makes for more successful labs. If nothing else, makes them better writers. It wont earn you a whole lot of points on the matrix, but perhaps adds to the so called intangibles of your application. 3) You should at least keep track of them for your own purposes.  Some schools want to see that in the tenure package. 4) IF you have no funded proposals, then sometimes people will list them, especially if they intend to resubmit with revisions in the next cycle.  However, if I listed all the failed proposals I wrote (haviing been a professional proposal writer for a while) my CV would double in size!  You send out a lot of proposals for some things before you get funding, others you can only send to one or two places! :)","Just rocked an interview, and loved the people and the school. Loved it. I think they will make me an offer. But the dean indicated that the salary offer would be in the high 40s. I nearly threw up. It's at a very small SLAC in a low cost of living area (but exactly what I want personally in every way. I just never imagined a salary so low. Was hoping for a mid-high 50s offer that I could negotiate to 60k. Sigh.... What would you do? 2) Negotiate and see what happens. 3) welcome to reality.  Most schools pay crap 4) low cost of living + personal happiness + bad market.... doesn't sound so bad to me 5) Yep that seems like most SLACs. Some of the ""highly ranked"" colleges pay similar to R1s but most are low. That is on the low end but I interviewed at 3 SLACs last year. One was about 76 the other two were under 50. Big spread when you add it up over the years. Nonetheless, it is simply the reality of SLACs. You will have to hold out for a ""highly ranked"" school if you need higher salary (or an R1). I agree with #4. Also, if it is a nice place to live, then that is a huge bonus as well. 6) Everything can be negotiated. Make comparisons and some inflation adjustments. Otherwise it just depends on your personal situation: Do you have to or plan on feeding a family on that salary? Are you single? Housing/schooling needs? what are your alternatives? other offers? more post docs jobs? Could you use an offer to negotiate a better deal at your current instituation? OP) Thanks everyone! I guess the damn negotiations tab gave me unreasonable expectations. I haven't seen many offers that low on there, so I was expecting that it would be higher. I do need to support a family on that income. I have a spouse who will likely not be working right away and a baby on the way. But it is a fantastic place to live and great academically. I'm avoiding more postdocs because I think a research-only postdoc will make it even harder for a SLAC to want me (and that's what I want - God, I don't want to work at an R1!!!). Current position fortunately involves some teaching. Thanks all - you've made this seem more reasonable! Hope I get the offer! 7) Make sure to look at the school's benefits package.  If you have to pay $500 a month for your family's health insurance, it could be a struggle.  On the other hand, there are things more important than money.  I would take a pay cut to be closer to family or be able to spend more time with my kids. OP) Got the offer! Working on negotiation. The benefits are great. University covers 90% cost of health insurance, and retirement benefits also sound really good. The salary offer is 49k. Hoping to get them up 10%. I'd also like more in moving considering the distance of the move. Startup that they are offering will work, so I figure I'll say I can live with it if they are willing to give me a little more in moving and salary. Also promotion after 5 yrs with a 10k raise plus cost of living raises yearly. 9) Congratulations! 10% ask for salary is standard in my experience. They should be able to go there. Happy for you! 10) Great! Good luck negotiating a bit. Don't underestimate the toll of working/living somewhere you don't like.  11) willing to share what state the offer is in?  12) depending on the state, taxes are also an important consideration.  Remember, that all future raises are based on a percentage of initial salary - that's why the initial number is so important over a lifetime (13) regular COL increases make a big difference - many places don't have them so starting salary recs often assume you have the same salary for a while 14) Make sure you get that 'promotion after 5 yrs with a 10k raise plus cost of living raises yearly' in writing. OP) State is PA. They ended up going up to 50k in salary plus 8.5k moving (LONG distance, they'd offered 2k) plus 13.5k research (offer was 10k). Said they couldn't make the salary any higher because they have a policy that within a deparment, the newby cannot make more than the next most junior person and so on. At 50k the most junior person is already getting a raise, too. They said more would involve raises for multiple people, so they couldn't afford to go up more. But they do give cost of living raises yearly, which I understand is pretty great now. I accepted. 14) Sounds like a good gig. Congrats! ","Argue about the Pepperdine thing here if that makes you really happy 1) How long after being offered a position can one wait to answer?  I have 4 on-campus interviews in the next 2 wks, but the one I want the most (at this point) is last!  If an earlier one makes an offer, can I put off answering?  What do I say to them?  2) tell them you want a month to consider it.  If they say no, simply negotiate the bird in hand, accept it.  Then, if you get a better offer, tell them you have changed your mind.  (I asked for 8 mo for a postdoc, and was given it, but another job gave me a week).  IF they don't want to work with you, do what is good for you.  This is business at this point, not some kind of warm fuzzy discussion with your spouse or sig other. (Please don't take that as insulting, it is meant to drive home the reality.  They won't do you favors normally unless you ask or tell them too).  3) So, legally, can a person sign a contract and then get out of it to sign a contract with another university? 4) Completely legal, although it will not make you any friends. 5) Its also completely legal to, in August, notify you the budget line item wasnt filled so you are unemployed.  Again, you are not trying to win friends, you are conducting a business transaction.  6) I think that once you say yes, you are committed (even if legally you could say whatever). But if there is only a two weeks gap, it is likely that you can get the answer before you are committed to the first place. Riches problems... 7) I've got one offer with people applying the thumb screws to accept immediately, and another I'd like to consider.  How to keep hold of the bird in hand long enough to investigate the one in the bush?","Damn I just wasted 15 minutes trying to google the outcome of that potato search, and I'm a theoretical ecologist.

Venting is one thing (let's face it, searching for an academic job is miserable), but I can't stand all of the comments on the main list that put down specific jobs and the little fights that break out there. Isn't the point of this wiki that we're all in this together? 2) It's a public spreadsheet. Everyone who uses the spreadsheet is different. Some people are more antagonistic than others. Some people are more helpful than others. Ultimately, very little of the information found on these spreadsheets will help you get a job. Your experiences will be mostly unique. Take advice with a grain of salt. Be your best self in your application documents, your phone interviews, and your campus interviews. You don't want to work for a place that doesn't like you for who you are as a person/teacher/researcher. Good luck. 3) OP here - Thanks for the pep talk, but that isn't really my concern. I'm just ""venting"" about how I think that people should try to be more civil and respectful here, specifically when it comes to unwarranted dissing of specific departments, jobs, and even other applicants. Why can't we be more like scientists and stick to facts? 4) avoid the venting page if you don't want to listen to rants or other aspects of venting. 4) Because some people are naturally antagonistic and have to be negative about everything. Others just feel that their personal experiences/perspectives are correct and everyone needs to hear/read them; e.g., ""Because I witnessed ""A"" and the result was ""B,"" everytime I hear someone witnessing ""A,"" the result has to be ""B!"" Here's the truth...every department and every university has screwed up a search to the detriment of candidates (it happens); every department has shitty people and awesome people; ""fit"" is a subjective term used to evaluate a candidate based on a subjective array of criteria that every search committee member puts together in their own head; i.e., it has no meaning and when you don't get a job and hear you were not the best ""fit,"" just move on and don't worry about it; if you love research you will always find time to do research, regardless of the teaching load; a job that one person might hate another might love, and; internal candidates don't always get the job. 5) this is why we have a venting page 6) OP here - exactly! I just wish people would keep it to the venting page :) 7) The wiki is one place where peoples' voices don't have to be heavily edited. My perception is that negativity on the wiki may originate from a general lack of other places in academia for young scientists to vent. So, I would take it easy on people around here. As we know this can be a very brutal business, and occassionally, the negative feedback is actually read by SCs who frequent the wiki and therefore produce some modicum of positive change. There is also always the ""positive affirmation"" page for warm and fuzzy thoughts. 8) Thanks for the condescending remarks. I'll say it again - I'm referring to the fact that people are putting down jobs and departments in disrespectful ways on the main list that are very likely to discourage people from applying. I've noticed that a lot of these comments have been cleaned up lately, so thank you to whoever did that. If someone knows of a genuine and serious red flag somewhere, by all means, make it known. But I don't want to hear that you think a school is a ""glorified community college."" That's disrespectful to community college faculty, to faculty at the institution, and to prospective faculty who might have a different definiton of what qualifies as a good job than you.","startup funding I have no idea how to put one of these together or how to estimate one. Is there a good guide for doing so? 2) Get one from your PI or mentor that runs a similar lab. Walk around a lab that does similar work to what you want to do and write down every single thing in the lab. Getting real examples is the most useful though because you can save the work of looking up price estimates of every single item. 1) Thanks - good suggestions. What about costs for grad students and postdocs? 2) Costs for grad students and postdocs are really variable (both how much they cost and how much/if you're allowed to put them in startup). I'd try to ask the search chair or someone in the department who can give you more information in that case. 3) I asked for lists from friends who had gotten positions in the last few years, mostly former postdocs in my PhD lab. Got their lists and modified them. Saved a lot of time.","Dear first choice candidates everywhere: when you get the offer hurry the fuck up and accept so the rest of us can get our rejections in a timely manner.

"lone ecologists I'm sure this will turn into some kind of rant, but does anyone have any success stories of being the lone ecologist? What worked for you, how did you attract students, etc. THere seem to be quite a few lone ecologist scenarios this year, and I'm sure we'd appreciate the advice. Again, I'd be happy to have any job and I'm not complaining, but any advice would be most appreciated (1) well, you can get your grants and attract students, that is not the problem.  The problem is that there will be no one to serve on committees who is very useful to the students, no one to discuss your science with who has much interest or idea what you do, and everyone who is in nonecology areas is likely to look down on you as not doing real science because you are in ecology, especially if you are doing stuff that DOES NOT require or utilize any molecular techniques.  Now, if you are doing population genetics, or other areas that bridge the gap between the nonecologist and the ecologist you may have a fighting chance and will not have the aforementioned problems. 
2) I don't know of any real lone ecologists' success stories. The most common and closest to a ""success"" scenario is the lone ecologist leaving a lone ecologist position (exit strategy).  The other common scenario I've seen is the washed up and burned out lone ecologist who endures years of marginalization, low productivity, solitude and a very anticipated retirement. **MAN, DID YOU EVER DEFINE THIS ACCURATELY!
3) Being the lone ecologist can be hell, as indicated by many posts on here. However, it all depends on your particular situation. If you're more of loner (or bench type?) ecologist, don't care to attract students, and don't care whether you're looked down on by other faculty, then the lone ecologist position might be perfect for you.  I second what #2 says.  I know of many lone ecologists who either leave or bitterly stay. I suppose the ones who stay are your success stories. It all depends on how you define success.  Cruise some bench/micro/cell heavy departmental websites, it's easy to spot the lone ecologists. Take a look at their web page (if they have one) and, see for yourself the quantity and quality of their publications, the students they've mentored, and projects funded. Is that the success you want?  Ask yourself: "" Is this what I want? Can I see myself their shoes?"" 
4)  I think that lower on this or on the discussion page, there was a ""Lone Ecologist""  success story.  He managed to convince the other faculty to hire more ecologists, and they're standing at some 5 ecologists now.  I would also guess that you can be pretty happy as a Lone Ecologist at a SLAC or a four-year program.
5) My first TT position was a lone ecologist type situation. I stayed for 3 years. My 3 years there were somewhat successful, given the circumstances. While I didn't publish much, nor land any grants, I did enjoy teaching quite a lot.  I didn't manage to attract any top students from other areas but got to mentor a couple of internal undergrads and a master's student.  I did feel isolated but, I wasn't miserable.  I did always envy my grad school and post doc colleagues who landed positions in fully functional, well-oiled EEB programs.  I tried to initiate collaborations with my micro/molec faculty but in the end it was all talk. So, after 2 years and a divorce, I started looking outside of academia. I guess after 3 years, you can say I was burned out (to use the term stated above). Now, 4 years into industry, I'm trying to wedge my way back into academia. So far so good. (6) OP here, my god, these are the sadesnt ""success"" stories I have ever heard. I'm doomed...
7) OP, it certainly is a dire situation, as many on here can confirm. My story is like that of #5's minus the divorce and leaving academia. I left my lone ecologist position 6 years ago after only 1.5 years into it. It wasn't easy to leave but I had to. I regret having accepted it but at the time I thought it was a smart move.  It turned out to be a waste of time and money.  In addition to and aside from the difficulties listed here, I found it very difficult to 1) not only attract students but to keep students. No student interested in ecology wanted to stay because there were no potential committee members who could contribute anything worthwhile to their theses and, 2) I was warned periodically that my chances of making tenure were going to be slim because of the different standards that my bench and labby faculty colleagues applied to tenure. They just didn't ""get"" why field work was necessary or worthwhile and didn't understand why my N (sample sizes) were so low, in comparison to their work. The other major factor was the students. Unfortunately, the majority of student in my ex-department were either interested in premed or were completely ""infatuated"" with the other (micro/molec/biomed). So they didn't care about behavior, evolution, or ecology, no matter how much I tried to motivate them. I had a few students volunteer on a project or two but, overall they were interested in publishing only to make their cv's or resumes look good for their med school apps. My faculty colleagues were completely apathetic!  And to this day, my ex-department has hard feelings for me leaving. I had to do what I to do and I haven't looked back since. So I don't consider my story a failure but a success because I forged ahead.
8) Whoever posted after #2, do you mind if I move your **MAN, DID YOU EVER DEFINE THIS ACCURATELY! comment to a new post, #9? (9) no problem!  
9) The lone ecologist situation, as many of you call it, is a career killer. Don't do it! #2 put it perfectly: all the ""lone ecologists"" I know who have remained in their shitty departments are burned out, washed up, miserable, people eagerly awaiting retirement. The ones I know who left such a position, had a very difficult time applying and finding another position. There are so many unforeseen time traps that make it very difficult to job hunt. Lone ecologist issues aside, other factors like family happiness (lack of),  mentoring, and  teaching, etc. can compound a stressful situation. I'm a survivor from this and my advice is to not do it! It's simply not worth ""a job"". (10) Feeding a family is worth ""a job"" Getting to be a biologist, regardless if you are the only ecologist, is worth ""a job""... 11) I agree with your first point #10.  Any job that brings home money for raising a family is worth it.  But, the problem with many (at least, from my experience and observations) is that lone ecologists often times don't ""get to be biologists""  and are often ridiculed  and condescended on by their own faculty micro/molec/biomed colleagues. Many lone ecologists don't do the biology that they envisioned themselves doing during grad school or post doc years (even the work presented during their job talks or in their research statements). This discontentment undoubtedly spills over into their personal/family life. Of course, everyone's situation is different and everyone with families will make different sacrifices. So my advice is that if you absolutely can't avoid taking a lone ecologist position, start planning your exit strategy. If you have a ""job"" that's paying the bills, such as a postdoc, and are not desperate, wait for a position from a department with more than 2 ecologists (or organismal biologists) in it, granted some bio depts. are very small. Good luck! ",Montana State Any word of offers for either position (Animal or Plant Community Ecologist)? I think both positions have been offered (although offers may or may not have yet been accepted),NA,NA,"To apply again or not... I am in the 4th year of my first postdoc and have been presented with a new opportunity. I will be getting a substantial pay raise and be working for the government, which can turn into a permanent position if I want that. However, I have always envisioned myself as a professor with a lab (MS students and undergrads only), and I desperately want to be in the classroom and acting as a member of a department. I *get* academia. It is what I was born to do. However, my partner is TT at a school several states away (not in science) and is enjoying serious success. They are at an R1 that wouldn't even give me the time of day. Now we are both trying to get TT jobs at liberal arts schools. I have 4 on-campus interviews (3 down, 1 to go) with possibility of a 5th. However, I have two more job apps that are due and I just don't have the motivation. I already got rejected for the first school, and now I am convinced the same will happen with the other jobs. How do you motivate yourself to keep going? I am battling with the feeling of self-defeat, even though I have had some success landing interviews. I appreciate what has been said upstream, especially the bits about not taking this personally. That was very hard when I got denied after the first on-campus interview (which I thought I aced).  1) I've suffered the rare case of academic long-term unemployment due to a combination of personal and circumstantial reasons. For a couple of years, I didn't believe I could find a job in academia anymore. I've had countless ""suggestions"" from friends and family to consider alternative careers, and have seen plenty of forum discussions of ""quitting academia"". But I've never stopped trying, because I feel that I don't know how to do anything else, given how long I've been doing biology. I finally saw the light at the end of the tunnel when I was awarded a prestigious fellowship last month, and I think I'm back in business. What I'm trying to say is that if you know that academia is your true passion, perseverance can pay off. 2) Wow...good job #1! OP - Four years in a postdoc with 4-5 campus interviews is quite successful. 6 or more years is not uncommon for a postdoc these days. Getting a job in acadmia is a marathon for sure. If it is really what you want, you should stick with it. I will say that I know people who have left academia and are really happy and like their jobs.  No advice on the two body problem...I think it is harder for SLACs to do spousal hires but not sure. Good luck! 3) I am the OP. Thanks for the feedback. Just starting to realize that the interview process is even trickier than I thought it would be based on feedback I received from the search chair from a recent rejection. I am also understanding that my spouse is going to have to negotiate us a position, or one of us will have to leave academia. I don't fancy living apart for the next 5 years until I can land a stellar position. Anyway... not feeling too hopeful but have to suck it up for the next interviews. 4) What do you mean by 'trickier than I thought based on on feedback from chair....'? I am really curious. Getting the offer is such a black box. I have felt that talking to chairs post-rejection can be helpful. I am just very curious what the search said in your situation. 5) OP again. Trickier in that you have to have your guard up the entire time you are on an interview. And when they press you to test your mettle, you have to keep that interaction between you and that faculty member. It can't be mentioned later in the interview, even if faculty member W wants to know about how your meeting with X went. That is tricky. 6) Ask for a shared position, if they don't understand what that is and how it works, have them contact Denison University, the bio department there is very familiar with it.  WHat happens is you both have less teaching, and the school gets double the faculty.  I guess they pay more than for one but less than for 2 but you would have to check up on exactly how it works. 7) But the Denison situation is different because both are in Bio.  The OP said his/her partner is in a different field.  (Unless I'm mistaken and Denison splits positions across departments.) (8) Don't make it a choice as to whether or not to apply. As much as you can, leave emotions out of it, and keep plugging away. I applied to 50 jobs last year with some interviews (and the one that fit dropped funding at the last minute), and another 50 this year. I took a position I am thrilled about this year that I almost didn't apply to! The same can happen to you, so don't deny yourself the opportunity. ","What are the strangest experiences anyone has had during an interview?  Let's entertain each other with laughable and weird moments while we wait the outcome of searches.  Of course, only discuss prior years and be honest! 1) I think this thread can begin and end with the person who posted on here that they had sex with the search chair (drops mike and walks off stage). 2) Wow, sex with the chair!  Bravo!  I had some heavy flirting with a faculty member at my last interview.  When I interviewed for gradschool, I hooked up with my gradstudent host. But sex with the chair takes it! damn! 3) sexual harrassment on the interview 4) That's not very laughable.  I don't believe any of the sex stories, but sexual harassment during an interview I can believe. 4) racist comments (also not laughable or entertaining, but weird) 5) I was on a search committee once in which one of the senior faculty decided it was ok to discuss religion and then ask about the person's sexual preferences.  Yes, this was a backwater southern school in a impoverished, isolated southern town in Texas! 6) it's really shocking how most faculty in southern, small regional state universities really do not know how to behave.  7) During interviewing conversation went towards spousal hiring. I was advised that I should just hire my spouse on my grant money. 8) I guess they've never heard of nepotism laws. 9) its not nepotism if you co-author the grant. 10) 7) here again, answer to 9): But writing a grant proposal together is not the same as hiring a spouse on an existing grant. The interviewer meant the latter. 11) Having a student pray in front of me during lunch. Totes awkward, and it wasn't a religious school by any stretch of the imagination. A close second would be when an assistant provost usurped a meeting I was having with a faculty member and proceeded to berate me about my CV and my teaching background. Most aggressive, unprofessional interaction I have ever had on a job interview. 5) hey 6, its not really everyone.  In this case we had a lot of cronyism and a couple of full professors who were from a local church.  These were very racist/sexist people.  I put up with them for a long time as junior faculty.  Luckily, I escaped.  9) hey I agree, its not the same ting! :)  10) try having graduation for a public texas university in the local baptist church, and having the minister give a homily and prayer session prior to graduation.  When you are in some of these places, the bill of rights goes out the window. 12) In a combined faculty Q and A, I had a faculty member attack me as being a poor fit for the department then walk out of the room. They offered me the job the next week.","So I guess it's a spouse-funded ""sabbatical,"" for me, yay!! What two-body problem?? (I kid; this is the one time it comes in handy) 2) Love the expression 'spouse-funded sabbatical'. I am on that too. 3) (This is #1) I just learned this term since having my dreams dashed. I guess I was deluded when I got into this field. I love love ecology but they don't warn you about this. Well at least my dog is happy having me home. Oh and I am still writing papers. The delusion continues. Maybe it will pay off next year.","Average number of applications 1) Do you have the classes you will be teaching listed in your contract?  At my last place of employment, I was made promises about what I could teach, but only some of those promises were listed explicitly in the contract.  Then once I got there, I was not permitted to teach the classes that I really wanted.  What is the norm? 2) Nope, but they will not make the course schedule until May. However, I was hired specifically to teach the main courses I want to teach (big program at this university, person who built that program is retiring, no one else to teach it), so it is pretty much guaranteed. 3) It varies from uni to uni. Some SLACs, yes. Some R1s, yes. But, I would agree with #2 that the mode is no. 4) depends on the school.  A friend of mine at an R1 not only has the courses listed, he can't sway his research out of the area for which he was hired.  Some schools have a specific need and want you to specifically teach a course which will be required of you.  Others may be optional.  If they list them, I would try to get some listed as optional for replacement.  But its your call.  I have never had a school do this on paper, but verbally its almost always the case. ","Well, I did find this: http://explore.jobs.ufl.edu/cw/en-us/job/493674/assistant-professor-applied-tomato-geneticist","notifying searches about job offer 1) At what point should a candidate with a job offer notify other ongoing searches about this offer? Is it inappropriate to ask about the progress of other searches, in the interests of learning the timing of interviews/offers? 2) If you were short listed for an interview, definitely write to ask.  It can speed up a decision at the other school.  If you were long listed maybe write for more information about timing and how long you should hold out. 3) Depends on the particulars. I mentioned my other offer during the interview for the job I actually took, and not before, because there was no actual hurry.  If you have a specific reason-- ""I've been offered a job at X but would really rather come to your university; X wants a response from me by DATE"" is nicely specific and I cannot imagine a scenario in which this is not relevant to bring to the attention to the chair of the search. It also does not hurt to ask about status of search if you have a reason to inquire. The ongiong search might not always be able to speed things up, but sometimes outside pressure can have effects.  3.) It might have negative effects. I interviewed at two places immediately after an offer. I told them that I had an offer (no details) during the exit interview. I think that it turned them off; and I'm surprised that I didn't get either offer, as I sensed that I was the #1 candidate going in. They want you a little grovvely. I know that this goes against conventional wisdom, but that's my experience. 4) SC member here.  I can't imagine a scenario in which a committee would want you less because you were desirable to another institution.  It's the mate-choice copying effect, and academics are not immune.  I think your spidey sense that you were #1 was off.  5) I have heard of R2's going cold if they think you have an offer from an R1, but that is the only scenario where it's a bad thing.  Or maybe if an R1 thinks you have an offer from an Ivy, but that's even more stupid.  Just make it clear that you view their institution as having unique benefits and they would be a strong contender against the other offer.   5) #3 here. Could be that my spidey-sense was off. But it was actually like #5 said. I was at liberal arts colleges after an R1 offer. And the salary was about 25% less, and there was probably a tell on my face when they shared that. ","An offer might come this week or it might not.  2) Waiting is the worst! 3) especially when it's only gradually clear that you won't get an offer. X6 4) Yup, nothing like knowing that I am by far the least qualified candidate interviewed <-5) though the fact that you got interviews means you'll kill it next year if you don't get an offer this year!  6)  LOL #5.  Wishful thinking!  I see much of it as the luck of the draw.  He/she may interview this year and interview no where next year.  All depends on the composition of the search committee, what the chair/head wants, whether or not there is an inside candidate, and God only know what else.  It's what they call ""fit"", which is the worst excuse for not interviewing awesome candidates without really providing them with any real idea as to why they didn't make the short list, make it to an interview, or get an offer.  7) Your CV, letters and statements got you the interview, but after that, other factors are playing a HUGE role.  8) Other factors? 9) Personality, how flexible you will be when it comes to important departmental decisions. Will you be buddies with certain people? 10) nothing starts your day off better than seeing that an offer has been made for your dream job and seeing that the internal candidate (with a very weak CV) has posted their acceptance of said job on facebook...FML 11) you could be the internal candidate and watch the offer go to someone else who has a weaker cv 5 again) Well, I guess everyone's experience is different! 12) I'm watching a job that has an internal candidate so now I'm furiously refreshing the wiki. 13) #9 I wish it were as simple as personality, but I can't help but think this whole process is just slightly better than random. 14) Does it strike anyone else as not cool that job searches generate this kind of (accurate) impression and most are state government jobs? If the process for hiring police officers went like this, would people be ok with that? 15) That's the way many if not most government jobs work - internal staff candidates at my instituion get first pick. Veterans get preference with federal jobs - it's the law. 16) It's amazing how variable it all can be. I have been directly involved with five searches at three different institutions that had internal candidates. None of the internals were ever hired, and all had competitive CVs. I guess some SCs have the ""grass is always greener mentality,"" but it's obvious that others do not. To be honest, as a tie breaker, I have no problem with ""already acclimated to the university/town"" tipping the scales in favor of an internal candidate; however, it is frustrating when it is painfully obvious that an internal hire was not the best candidate. But, ""best"" is subjective, and job searches are usually vague enough that anything can be used to say one candidate ""bested"" another. 17) Somehow we went from waiting to internal candidates. Waiting still sucks. 18) Yea. The computer science intern in my lab was looking for a job for a month. He got several interviews and a job offer in that month and starts his new job soon. Goddammit... 19) But then you'd have to work as a computer scientist. It sounds good to have a job, but I wouldn't trade that career for biology. 20) I would think most biologists know that getting a job isn't easy and that other fields are certainly more marketable, such as computer science, marketing or various medical trades. It's an occupational hazard. 21) I'm in same position as OP, and I'm having trouble resisting urge to constantly check email/ phone/ website google analytics.  How long do most people wait after the last interview (although in my case I don't know exactly when the last interview was, but not more than a week after mine)?  I saw something (found by google) saying people heard back after 2 or 3 days after they interviewed.  That seems crazy to me!  Especially if the whole department facutly have to vote. 22) 2-3 days is not normal. I've been on two campus interviews; one took 2 weeks and the other took 3 weeks after the last candidate had interviewed (although they may have contacted their first choices a bit earlier than that). 23) The search I'm waiting on said they'd make an offer within 2-3 weeks of the last (my) interview. Sometimes the offer needs to be approved by the ""higher ups"" before you are notified, which can take a bit of time. 24) Votes should happen very quickly (say a week) after the last candidate's visit so that the interviews are fresh everyone's mind. If the chair is good at their job and there aren't weird political issues on the campus, they will contact you by phone to confirm that you're still interested in the job and notify you while the university approves and issues the offer. So, don't fall for the lines that it takes time for the approvals, they are just being coy and/or protecting the privacy of all candidates.  I can never figure out the secrecy involved, we all know what silence means. So while you hear nothing for weeks, realize negotiations with higher ranked candidates are being made. If those fail, they may come to you, otherwise you'll get the official rejection from the university's HR department several weeks later after offers have been agreed upon and signed. It's a silly process - I think it would be better to notify all candidates to say what is going on. When I was in grad school, all faculty candidates were notified that either they were first choice or not. Or if candidates totally bombed they'd get the official rejection immediately. To me that seems like a more open process. 23 again) I got an offer 1 week after interviewing! 25) hugely variable from university to university (and department to department and position to position within a department) in when you will hear. Although some chairs/heads will call before it is approved by higher ups I know of 2 instances where that happened and then the hire wasn't approved, so a lot of chairs won't do this. Weird politics is the norm at many universities. 21 again) I got the offer!  It was less than 2 weeks after the last person visited, and the Chair said they did confirm with Dean before calling me, just to be sure. 26) Congratulations!! 27) Wohooo!  That's great.  I'm hoping I'm next... 28) Sorry #27, I got the offer....","Resources for acaduos/ dual-career couples I wondering if there are good resources that the many 'acaduos' on this wiki are using that are helping them to negotiate the 2-body problem. Is there a Facebook group or something? I have so many questions for the people who got it to work (according to the negotiations page, there are success stories!) and the people who didn't get it to work (yet). Obviously this is a specific issue, but one that a lot of us are facing. Anyone with ideas or resources or wanting to share stories? 2) Unless you or your spouse are a hot commodity, don't expect it to be easy. Even if the university has a dual career policy, they will approach it from an economic cost/benefit analysi s and for the university to open up two positions, espect some hard negotiating and using whatever leverage you may have at your disposal. If you are a postdoc and have few if any other offers, expect the university to try to fish that information out of you and use it to their benefit. We speak from experience - inteviewed and have had offers from places that do have dual career policies on paper - don't expect them to walk their talk and expect them to make excuses why it won't work, etc. It's like buying a car. Fortunately, it did work out for us, eventually. Leverage mattered in the end. 3) What do you mean by leverage? Alternative offers elsewhere? 4) Something that give you 'value' whether the value is inferred by another institution wanting you or you have skill that have value or you have high potential, big grants or high impact publications.Offers will help if the offers are from a university of higher rank/value.   5) It would definitely help if we could put together lists of institutions and their stance on dual career hires.  Some Unis have official systems and it helps to know what they are.  Others have a less formal understanding, and knowing who has to sign off will be helpful.   Should we start a page here? Or elsewhere?? 6) I think it would be just easier to wait until you get an offer and then negotiate your best. If you get an interview look through their college or administrative websites. Sometimes faculty members will mention the dual career policy or it will be obvious if there are couples in the department. But be careful, they may fish for information. Even if a university has a policy, it's not as if a switch is flipped when you tell them you have a spouse who needs a job. They may listen and understand your concerns but may not have the funds or another candidate in another department is fighting for a spousal position, too. My spouse and I managed to get positions at the same university that doesn't have a dual career policy. It helped that we are not of the same profession and ended up in two departments. 7)  http://www.chronicle.com/forums/index.php/board,54.0.html 8) #7 beat me to it!","Restored from the depths of time: Fuck it, let's go bowling 2) dude abides 3) Over the line! 4) you're out of your element 5) I'll bring the white russians 6) These SCs are full of nihilists 7) Shut the Fuck Up Donnie! 8) I am the walrus 9) this is what happens when you fuck a stranger in the ass 10) Like an Irish monk? 11) 3/6/2018...Happy 20th Anniversary, Dude. 12) Strong men also cry.

Does that seem like a red flad to anyone else? I'm a bit concerned about interviewing in a department where I won't be able to meet the leadership and expect the vision or vibe could change somewhat in the near future. 2) I wouldn't say ""red flag"", but yes, it could definitely change the dynamics of the position. I think it's something to consider if you have multiple offers, but otherwise... 3) We had this happen in our department while I was in grad school (hiring a new asst. prof and subsequently a new chair)... believe me it was for the best. Though I'm sure the changing of the guard may make things bumpy, if the department chair/head is on their way out it usually works out for the best of the department (and thus the new faculty) in the long run. 4) Keep in mind, many places have 2-4 yr terms for dept head.  The person in leadership when you are hired is very likely NOT going to be in leadership when you go up for tenure.  Change is inevitable.  As dept head changes, dept business goes on and people are hired.  As long as you don't sense ""issues"" when on-site, don't worry about it too much.

How detailed should the research plan be? Should I give a broad overview or  also go into detail on the projects and papers that will comprise the broad research questions? Should I go into detail about the kinds of course that I could teach and the methods I will use. Really not sure how to approach this. Any suggestions would be appreciated! 2) That's all somewhat field specific, and your mentors should be able to give you advice. However: https://github.com/RILA B/statements. 3) I've met Karen Kelsy in person and while I have some issues with her methods and statements, she does have some helpful tips. I used her book 'The Professor Is In' to help revamp my teaching and research statements. This is the first year I received on campus interviews and offers. Not 100% sure if it was the reworking of the material or a factor of my current position plus more lines on the CV. 4) I think it might be helpful to get several research statement that recently hired faculty memebers used. I think a common mistake is to focus too much on your past research work. You might reference soemthing, but as a way to introduce a type of followup study you are planning. The length and detail could vary depending on the type of institution. Be sure to customize it somewhat for each application. I had three general research categories and for each one, I listed a specific type of project (a few sentences) that I would like to do with an undergraduate or MS student specific to potential field sites nearby 5) I think another common mistake is to think that a problem that is of interest and concern within your subfield will be obviously interesting/important to committee members outside of your discipline. You will need to devote substantial space to explaining importance (expections might include fields that are commonly in the public sphere, e.g. infectious disease or CRISPR or something).  Even at an R1 where the committee might be mostly people in your subfield you don't want to be too technical -- you want to showcase your vision for solving important problems, rather than your technical mastery of specific approaches. 1) It's me again! Thank you for the helpful advice everyone!"
"RANT I'm honestly sick and tired of the lack of news from SC's.  Granted, its been a bad day/week, but can't the SC's just tell us they are not interested in our applications.  If it wasn't for the Wiki, I would still think I had a  chance at several places.  I'm giving up on this job season.  Luckily I still have a  couple more years of funding, but AARRRGGG!    I'm not sure I'd want to be on a search committee this year, with a couple of hundred (or more) good applicants for searches even in relatively small departments. I'd love to receive prompt and frequent notification of my status in every search in which I've submitted an application, but I also have some sympathy. These (SCs) consist of real people, with real families and responsibilities, and a very difficult task of trying to choose a few excellent candidates to interview from a large number of very good applications!
(2) Boo hoo for the poor SCs. (3) Very clever repartee #2. Presumably if you're on the job market you've been in our field for some time. Has all this experience really led you to believe that members of academic search committees (and thus potential future colleagues) are as malicious and ill-intentioned as much of the discussion in this forum might lead one to believe? Or perhaps they are just overworked and over-committed like the rest of us? I often have difficulty getting my own colleagues in academic positions (who I would also call my friends) to respond to emails, particularly during the semester. Just don't take it personally, is my advice (and do with that what you will).
(4) While some SC's are truly made up of unpleasant individuals, and do not deserve our sympathy, I would like to mention that there are many SC's that keep us updated, respond to queries politely (if not always promptly), and send out personal rejection notices. In fact, most SC's do this. I am the first to rant about misbehaving SC's (I wrote the Black Hole Awards comment below), and I can say that, in my experience, only about 1/4 of all SC's, at most, can be called ""committees behaving badly"". 
(5) to #1 & #3 - Damn, I hate it when SCs troll the wiki. What part of ""venting page"" do you not understand? (6) To #5: Ha, wrong - not even close (but I'm glad I sound mature, if that's your implication).
7) Not mature, just *a little* douchebaggie. (=someone who isnt quite douchebaggish enough to be called a douchebag but partakes in enough douchebaggery to be a called a little bit of a douche) 8) I see. Very clever. My original posts (#1 & #3, noting also that these were my first ever posts to this site with the exception of information regarding jobs) were intended to strike a more reasoned and conciliatory tone than is usually presented in this forum. This is because I think that the anonymity of the page creates a strong temptation to put a very bad face forward, so to speak, and it is not one that I think reflects well on the participants in this site, myself included (or job seeking academics in general). But I can see now that my efforts are probably futile. Believe me, I appreciate from direct experience the difficulty of the job market. However, I have made a conscious decision NOT to blame the hirers, the search committees, and the potential future departmental colleagues who are themselves also working under difficult conditions, considerable pressure, difficult internal and departmental politics, etc. I would encourage other participants to consider adopting a similar attitude (or at least trying it on for size - you might find yourself less angry and frustrated if you do). Good luck to all.
9) #7, thanks for your input but, why on earth would you want to strike a ""more reasoned and conciliatory tone"" in a VENTING PAGE?! (=rhetoric not derision). Unfortunately, yes, your efforts on this venting page are futile, probably only sparking more anger and more ""bad face"" from the frustrated job seekers (who find this venting page as an anonymous outlet for their disappointment). I'm not #7 but I edited his/her post (I know, I know, no editing). #7, if you disagree, change it. Yes, Good Luck to All. 10) Ok, I give up, but I still feel that some of what is written on this page could be seen to reflect poorly on our community (whereas the same can't be said of the general academic wiki venting page: http://academicjobs.wikia.com/wiki/The_venting_page), and I think that's unfortunate.
(11) Dear #10, you have no idea how true your words are...SC's are lurking here. And the ignorant whining and ugly attacks confirms our suspicions about many of you. (12) Hilarious, #11. 13) oooh! I better be careful.
(14) Just because you're paranoid, doesn't mean they're not out to get you....Trolling anyone?","U of Puerto Rico Does anyone have any info on the status of this search? 'Vacancies' page states that the shortlist is made. Just curious, is Spanish fluency required? I posted the advertisement on the vacancies page but I have no information about whether a short list has been made. I got an email saying they were missing one of my letters of reference last week, but that's all. I bet fluency in Spanish is not officially required, but I imagine unofficially it might be.2) OP here, thanks! 3) #1 is probably right.  Spanish fluency is probably not required but if you get the job it will help, especially for everyday living in Puerto Rico. 4) Previous faculty have not been fluent, but, yeah, it helps. 5) Does it help to get an interview or offer? Rosetta Stone anyone? 6) Probably not. 7) UPR attracts many Latin American grad students whose English skill varies widely.  Clearly, having an advisor that is bilingual would be a plus.  Also, just for your overall day to day life, it helps to speak the language.  Not like you're going to learn it between now and interview time, however.8) Muchas gracias. Donde estar el bano? Mas salsa, por favor ...don't think I'd survive in PR. 9)lol, agreed! 10) I love Puerto Rico, and I would've probably applied for this position if it was in my research area.  It is a perfect location for a tropical biologist.  That said, I suspect that taking a position at a university in Latin America (albeit in a territory of the U.S. within Latin America) probably comes with its own share of hazards.11) I agree with #10. I've been there; it's beautiful and perfect for tropical ecology. However, I imagine it would be extremely difficult (hazardous) to live there if you don't speak Spanish. Also, Puerto Rican Spanish is unlike any other. I too would've applied but the research area wasn't close to my work and as much as I enjoying visiting, I wouldn't want to live there permanently (too far from my family). 12) I applied here and have not heard anything. For those who applied, do you have any updates? I don't think Spanish is officially necessary but I think some fluency would make life easier there. 13) OP here, I haven't heard anything aside from what #1 has posted. I don't check in here regularly but will post if and when I hear anything. 14) Still nada on this end, any other applicants know what's going on with this search? Can't believe it's May already; It seems pretty late in the season, eh? 15) I didn't apply here but can add that there is an unusually high number of schools this year that are also searching late into this job season. I'm not sure what to make of it. I have not heard back from some and am worried I'll be in the field if I get an interview. 16) 12 here, looks like UPR is under a lot of turmoil right now: student and faculty strikes and protests. Looks like they're getting violent too. Does anyone have any info or updates on the search? Is the search still going forward? Either way, this doesn't look good. Aside from the language barrier for me, I 'm not sure how I feel about potentially working in an unstable/riotous (potentially violent) environment, especially in Latin America (no offense to anyone). 17) OP again, thanks for the update #16. I had no clue about the strikes and, it does seem pretty grim. bummer! I still haven't heard anything from the search committee so I'm in the dark as far as the status of the search. Any word #1, #14 #12? 18) OP again, I just heard that the strike will continue, potentially threatening the UPR's operating license of an institution of higher education. Bummer! Anyone else have any info, particularly about the ecology search status? 19) I withdrew my application. Good luck everyone!  20) #10 here.  This is not the first (nor will it be the last, I'm sure) time that UPR-RP has been paralyzed by strikes.  Puerto Rico, although a territory of the U.S., is still part of Latin America, and anyone working there should probably be prepared for a political and social climate more similar to the Dominican Republic than to the continental U.S.  Isn't that part of the fun, though? 21) I agree #10/20. The UPR system has had more than its share of admin-student-faculty turmoil through out the years. It seems that this latest bout is the worst yet.  UPR may lose its operating license. If this happens, PI's would have to give back any fed money. That on top of student dissent, admin and fellow faculty contempt (the all too common, Latin American ""macho-ego""), a 200M deficit, language barriers, cultural confusion, earthquakes (a 5.8 yesterday) and hurricanes should make working at UPR...lots of fun! :D 22) I hate to break it to you applicants but, you should consider this search canceled. The situation in Puerto Rico does not look good at all. 23) :( 
24) Has anyone heard anything directly from the SC about the status of the search? Has it been canceled or postponed for next year? 25) think there was an offer",NA,NA,"~400 applicants at UMICH I just applied for the UMICH position, my application number was 38X! 1) Wow, good luck! OP) Thanks, it seems like search committees could narrow the description a little more to avoid getting this many applications. 3) In a day and age like this, you're almost guaranteed to get triple digit number of applicants regardless, especially at RU/VH schools like Michigan. 4) Smaller masters-levels schools in non-desirable locations typically get something more like 30-50 applications, regardless of the narrowness/broadness of the search. Probably the same is true of R1's, but 200-400 applications is the average no matter what. 5) I desperately applied for an instructor position at a community college (in a less-than-desirable location) last year, and was told that they only got 14 applications.6) Jeeeeesus. I was hoping my applicant number (low 200s) was just randomly generated, because I applied very soon after the posting went up. 400? 400 applications?!?! *weeps* OP)  I am not certain that the application number reflects the number of applicants, although it seems conistent with my experience with other positions. Someone did enter >440 applicants in the vacancy page after the deadline passed. I do hope it is not true, but there was not much in the language of the position announcement to discourage anyone, or their mother, from applying. I imagine there are similar numbers of applicants at UC Davis and Stanford where position descriptions were equally broad. I am curious about why search committees don't articulate a narrower description of what they want. Are they simply indecisive? 7) My application number was 44X. I sort of feel sorry for the search committee. 8) In response to #6 as to why SCs have vague, open searches like this: At my R1 we do this when we don't have a strong preference for the area of specialty, but simply want to try to hire the most promising rising star in a general field.  So I do think you tend to see this approach at top programs, such as the ones you mention.  The huge number of applications actually doesn't add that much more to our work load.  Since we're looking for the best of the best and don't have a particular specialty in mind, it's relatively quick (but still a lot of work) to weed out the lower 80% or so who don't meet our criteria.  It sucks for the applicants being 1 in a million, but it's an effective way to do a search at this type of program. 9) Saw some pundit on CNN ranting about one Wal-Mart hiring incident where they got 23,000 applicants for 600 positions (~2.6% success rate), and complaining that it's smaller chance than getting into Harvard (as a student). Little do these folks know that it's still orders of magnitude better chance than us getting a TT position.","reimbursement timeline How long should I wait for reimbursement for a campus visit before I send an email bugging the search chair about it?  (I gave my reciepts to the search chair, there was no department secretary). 2) I've waited up to 6 months, even after bugging them. It also helps to contact the department chair (search chairs are likely busy with other stuff but the chair actually has some power).  OP) Search chair actually is the department chair :/ I guess I should hold off emailing because it's ""only"" been a month...was hoping not to carry this balance on my CC, it is about $1,000! Why not just ask for a timeline on being reimbursed as you are trying to figure out your budget for the coming month (or something along those lines)","Don't decide not to apply just because you suspect you're not a ""perfect"" fit for a posting.  The posting is so often crap.  A friend of mine had seen a posting, but decided not to apply because he wasn't the best fit for the description (he's a terrestrial mammal genetic guy, and the posting was looking for animal physiology).  A colleague urged him to apply anayway, knowing that the posting was a bad description of what they were really looking for.  Long story short, he got the TT job.  If anyone can tell me why postings so often don't match what Search Committees (SCs) are really looking for, I'd love to hear it.  Now, because of my friend's experience, I'm constantly double-guessing myself as to whether I should apply for jobs that aren't exactly up my alley. 2) It is because departs often do not know what they want until they are reviewing applications.  Or in my case, adminstration snuck a ton of things in the ad that the depart didn't want or care for. 3) I agree with all of this. However, I would just add that you need to write your application materials to make yourself fit as best as you can. It is difficult to tell if some line in the job ad was snuck in by the Admin who won't care when the hiring is being made or if the department really feels that it is necessary. The trade-off comes in when you weigh the desire for the given job and your time to write to make it fit. 3) I interviewed at 2 places that had job descriptions that I did fit, but it turned out that they were really looking for people who had additional qualifications that I had that were NOT mentioned in the ad! I ultimately got an offer at one of those places. I also canceled another interview at a place that was a long-shot fit wise. So go figure...it's a crap-shoot!","Bard 1) During an on-campus visit, I am never sure what to bring up in the meeting with the dean. Your suggestions? 2) Stuff like salary offer range, startup, etc. should be brought up with the dean. However, I would not tell the dean expected numbers, just ask what it has been like in the past few years. Otherwise, just let the conversation flow naturally. I have had only nice meetings with deans and didn't ever feel stressed about what to say or ask next. 3) What are his/her expectations for junior faculty? How is the tenure decision made? Are there any internal grants available for faculty?  What do they think is the biggest surprise/challenge for new faculty coming into the college? 4) How does the dept fit into the dean's vision for the college? How does the dept stack up against others within and beyond the college? How has the dept changed over the last 6 years? What are the college-level expectations of a pre-tenure faculty member?  ",Now I want that tomatoE job !!!,"Has the age-bias changed? who deleted this? It was Anonymous Capybara :)  Restored from the history: (Capybara always messing things up!)
Noticed in the venting section that there are some complaints that at RIs, many are seeing searches with candidates with 5 or more years out from PhD. That's me. I finished in 2008, and I went on my first on campus in 2010. A bit of a dry spell (when I also wasn't searching that hard), until 2013, when I started in earnest. I was really contemplating environmental consulting, NGOs, Uber, you name it. And then this year, I got three on-campus interviews so far. I'm beyond 40. And by the statistics that the official folks (is is NSF, or NIH, or AAAS...can't recall), I shouldn't be hireable. Except, I see this at my current institution too. Most folks getting interviews are with PhD dates 2010 and earlier. I don't want to confuse an anticidote with a trend, but it seems that way. And several mentors have commented on my maturity relative to the market. I guess what I'm saying is that it seems that the paradigm that you either land your TT job 3 years post Phd, or you are screwed has changed. And now, it seems like the new normal is to be 5-7 years post-phD to get a job. Has anyone else noticed the same trend? So the good news is, if you've been looking for a while, keep your head up. But I suppose if you think that you will only do 1 postdoc in this market....think again. 2) I've been in my post-doc just over a year and have applied for a dozen or so R1/R2 jobs. I've had absolutely no interested from R1 but have been getting nibbles (ie phone interviews so far) from several R2. I completely agree with #1 (and have also been told that) I probably will not be marketable for R1 until I've completed 3-5 years of a post-doc. I guess you have to be in it for the long haul these days! 3) Check out this depressing data from France. From 2005-2014 the average number of papers for new TT hires went from 12.5 to 22 and the average number of postdoc years went from 3.3 to 8. http://fixingpsychology.blogspot.ca/2015/06/the-academic-job-market-has-gotten.html 4) And people wonder why there's such a diversity problem, of all stripes, in academia... 5) I hate this page so much. 6) Tenured prof. #1: We've got a real problem with this job market thing. Tenured prof. #2: Why don't we give that a lot of lip service while simultaneously making it worse and adding misery to all? Tenured prof. #1: Brilliant! 7) I think maybe there's some variation depending on the search? I'm in my first year of postdoc (without a particularly astronomical pub list), yet I've been on a few campus interviews so far. From what I've gleaned looking at who else has been interviewed (and who's been interviewed at places that rejected me), the searches that interviewed me interviewed other very young (1-2 years of postdoc) candidates, whereas others went for more senior (multiple grants, senior postdocs or assistant profs) folks. 8) We are going through a search where I am a VAP. The candidates going from Skype to short list had PhD years ranging from 2006 – 2010. (basically the short list was all 2012 and prior). Folks with PhD dates earlier are not competing with people that have more solid pub, grant, and teaching records. It's a teaching focused place, yet pub records (15 plus) is appealing to the committee. 9) Of the ""anon quals"" people who have gotten offers, PhD years are listed as 2008, 2009, 2013, and 2015. 10) I don't think the anon quals list is at all representative. My impression from talking with people who have been on the job market for more than a couple years is that they do not post/check on the wiki much and the ones that do post on there may only do so after they have interviews/offers. 11) I think there is a general trend towards longer postdocs for sure and there are definitely a lot more open rank positions coming up now where you often need to have funding to be competitive. That said, I know of several instances of individuals getting R1 positions during the first year of their postdocs - but, they had at least one science/nature pub.","Dear Academia-university politics, especially related to searches, suck beyond the imagination.   2) Letting good scientists run a risk of no job just because your Ecologists and Geneticists don't get along seems pretty unconscionalble.  Yet it seems to happen so often. ","some advice for those in negotiations Were there comments here at some point? If you're asking for advice, never accept the initial salary offer, as they usually start low.  Ask for at least 10% more and hope you get 5% more.  2) Know the stats for your field. This will help you figure out if they are low-balling you.  Based on data I have, Evolution or Mol Bio starting salaries last year were generally $75k with no starting offer.  With a counter offer you should probably get $85k.  Startup should be $650k-800k.  If you have multiple offers or fancy awards, you can probably get $1M. Among friends who sent startup lists of 1M, they generally got $750k-800k.  Friends who sent startup lists of $600k got $550k.  At some schools staff may be easier to get than equipment or consumables. Grad student support often comes from a different budget.   Make sure you have padding in each category.   Try to ask faculty how that school prioritizes startup categories.  Make sure you have a full understanding of sunset clauses. This advice is for R1s, not teaching schools. 3)  LOL!  I was going to say, that those numbers are a bit off for M.S.-level schools and B.S. schools.  I'm at an M.S. school and they'll probably offer you high 50's or low 60's, so ask for at least 70K.  For start up, you'll be lucky to get $100K.  Oh, and I know UT-Knoxville was starting folks around $80K with $500K in start-up, but that varies a little 4) Those numbers for startup are way high even for 95% of R1s. Maybe not so high for a true Mol Bio lab, but very high for most Evolution positions. At the Ivy league school I'm familiar with (where money is not hard to come by) even the low numbers here are beyond the normal 'cap' for startup packages in evolution or ecology. Some people do get more than that if there are specific needs, but it required special procedures and different pots of money.","Do you think that a lot of people commenting on this page will get a job? 2) Yes!  3) Eventually  4)OP, are you #18 in the Big Lebowski post?   5) what's the beef against #18 quoting the movie everyone else was quoting?

Needless to say I was pissed when I found out and any respect between us was lost. They're now search committee chair and I haven't made it through to the short list. The reason I was given was that the top candidates were much stronger. I can see who has been invited for interview from the website and whilst one candidate on paper looks miles better, another has fewer pubs. fewer grants, less mentoring experience I  guess this person didn't disclose our former personal relationship so if they're dishonest about that, why would they be honest now? Does anybody know what would happen if I made a complaint? 2) Do you really want to work with this person around and senior to you for the rest of your career? (barring a move to another uni). Just curious. 3) They could have hypothetically recused themselves. 4) I'm sorry you ran into this bum again under such circumstances. However it's hard to imagine any positive outcome from filing a complaint, which would just consume your time and mental/emotional energy. There is just too much ambiguity in the process so the colleague / university can easily deny bias, getting hired is already unlikely even without a biased SC, and the remedy is unclear (the job's probably filled). This should be a rare situation to find yourself in again, so I'd treat it like getting hit by a meteorite and keep on working towards other jobs. 5) Unfortunately just because someone looks better on paper from what you can glean, it doesn't mean that they didn't outscore you on the committee's qualificaiton matrix if they used one (which most do). The committe's decisions may seem ambigious like #4 mentioned, but may be easily defendable too. 6) I'd never heard of a qualification matrix. 7) When I served on an SC we definitely used an evaluation rubric to combat potential biases. Maybe you could ask for your scores or evaluations? Although that would likely involve interacting with the SCC again.   8) What other scenarios are there where this person might not recuse themselves.  Grant reviews?  Paper reviews?  They should have dropped themselves from evaluation of your app, and could have given a mild excuse to do so without losing face.  I agree that it will be difficult to do anything without a major fuss.  They are likely to get off with a slap on the writst.  If you think this person has continuing influence you might consider documenting the event.  If you feel comfortable having the conversation, you could make it clear to your colleague what your expectations are for future evaluations and how you would file a formal complaint if they influence the fate of your applications again.  This job is a wash, but there might be a bigger future at stake.  Just remember whatever you do will inevitably be traced back to you. 9) OP here, thanks for all the advice. I think it's fair to say complaining would be futile and if my suspicions are false then could end up ruining my own reputation. I'll wait and see who is hired... if it's the research superstar my fate was already doomed. But life lesson learned!  9) #6 and others - many universities require a matrix in evaluating candidates (I have seen this at multiple instituitons) for fair hiring practices.  The ""matrix"" has to be filled out at each stage to support decisions, with each step approved by HR.  So, likely that they have supporting information.  I would take this as a sign that you don't want to work somewhere with this jerk and move on.","Maybe not a vent, but the thread could easily spin towards venting.  I am curious - does the job search process eventually work out for most of us?  The stress of multiple years and often multiple postdocs and moves is undeniable.  However, I am getting the impression that most people eventually get a faculty (or equivalent research/teaching-oriented) position.  I'm sure we all know people who dropped out of the pipeline, but is that a small minority?  Just curious - looking for a bit of a morale boost. 2) 8% of biology PhDs end up in the tenure track in the US, and 0.5% of STEM PhDs end in the tenure track in the UK, so no. The overwhelming majority of PhD holders will never get a tenure track job. 3) Where are those statistics from? Just a guess that the low number might be due to the very large no. of molecular & cellular folks who move into industry after a PhD. Of those who go on to do postdocs and actively broadly apply for TT jobs out of grad school, I'd posit that more than 8% are ultimately successful. 4) Also, a huge number of biology PhDs in both the US and UK come there just for the education and then leave back to their home countries or to other countries...so they were never going to end up in the tenure track system. In ecology, I know only one person who seriously spent time trying to get an academic job and dropped out for something else (and it was due to extreme geographical constraints) 5) Jeremy Fox from Dynamic Ecology here. The relevant data are in Hampton & Labou 2017 Ecosphere: https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ecs2.2031. Unfortunately, the way they chose to break the data down means you have to do a bit of work to figure out the answer to the question asked by the OP. According to Table 1 in Hampton & Labou 2017, 40.6% of the ~3800 people who received PhDs in ecology from US institutions from 2000-2011, and who aren't postdocs, held a tenured or tenure-track faculty position as of 2013. Hampton & Labou also say in the main text that 4826 people in total got PhDs in ecology from 2000-2011; as of 2013 some were postdocs and a much smaller fraction were involuntarily unemployed. So (.406*3800)/4826 = .319, i.e. 31.9% of people who got PhDs in ecology in the US from 2000-2011 held tenured or tenure-track faculty positions as of 2013. I recognize that that may not exactly address the question asked, for instance because those data include the career outcomes of some unknown number of ecology PhDs who never wanted and never sought a faculty position. But hope that helps. The other way to approach this is to look at the anon quals data here and on previous ecoevojobs.net spreadsheets (see https://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2019/03/20/a-statistical-profile-of-recent-eeb-faculty-job-applicants/). If you do that, you find that about 42% of ecology faculty job seekers report receiving at least one TT offer in a given year, assuming (as is fairly plausible) that nonreporters got no offers. Obviously, there could be sampling biases that make anon quals page users unrepresentative of ecology faculty job seekers as a group. There are various lines of evidence that they're not *massively* unrepresentative, but obviously it's hard to say *exactly* how representative they are. Again, hope this helps, good luck. 6) A caution if you are reading the above interpretation of Hampton and Labou - these are PhDs in Ecology. This doesn't account for people with PhDs in Biology, Botany, ENVS...etc. that are ecologists. PhD programs that offer an ecology degree are at highly ranked institutions, so their graduates are more likely to get a job because of their pedigree. If your PhD is in ecology (and you got your PhD 6 to 10 years ago), you are the population that this paper represents. If your degree is in a different named discipline, this survey doesn't represent you. 7) The data for #2's percentages come from three sources: the 2012 NIH workforce report, the 2010 Royal Society Report, and the NAS Postdoc Survey. They have made a nice graphic of your destiny here: https://www.ascb.org/careers/where-will-a-biology-phd-take-you/ OP) Thanks to everyone for their responses - I appreciate the thoughtfulness of this group.  My sense is that the data that exist on this topic fail to capture the nuances associated with the career paths and study population.  I, like many here (I assume), am applying for TT jobs but would be happy, in theory, with a research-oriented position (gov., NGO, etc) and possibly a non-TT teaching position.  My experience and intuition tell me that 3&4, whose responses are anecdotal and somewhat speculative (not a criticism - we just have no robust data!) are closest to the truth of the PhD ecologist's fate.  Of the people I knew in grad school who *finished* before and after me (N~20?), I can only think of one who did not end up with some type of PhD-level position.  I don't suggest that this is an unbiased or represeantative set of samples, but my (naively?) optimistic opinion is that most PhD ecologists who choose to (and are able to) pursue a career in ecology do, in fact, end up with a reasnoably suitable position.  The 10% unemployment figure in the ASCB figure seems plausible and consistent with my experience (for whatever that is worth). 8) Jeremy Fox here again. Apologies for misinterpreting your question. If the question is ""what fraction of ecology PhD recipients eventually end up in employment that makes some use of their ecological education/skills/training"", Hampton & Labou have data on that as well. The fraction is very high: a large majority of people who received ecology PhDs from 2000-2011 were, as of 2013, in some sort of ecology-related employment, whether in academia, government, NGO, or private sector. And as of 2013, only 3.5% of people who got ecology PhDs from 2000-2011 were in involuntary unemployment. Which lines up with data on the involuntary unemployement rate for PhD holders as a whole (PhD holder involuntary unemployment rate is around 3% in the US at the moment if memory serves, and is always appreciably lower than the overall involuntary unemployment rate).  OP) Many thanks, Jeremy.  The initial question was not clear because I am trying to synthesize thoughts and emotions surrounding the job search process in real time.  I'll look at the H&L analysis but it is good to know that there is reason for optimism even in the face of non-contact and outright rejection from faculty job applications.","Liberal arts/PUI teaching load What is the average teaching load at a SLAC (or PUI)? A friend thinks it's 1.5 a year. This seems insane. I was imagining it might be more like 2/2 at the very least? 2) The ones that I've interviewed at ranged from 2/1 (super-elite SLACs) to 3/3 or even 4/4 at the others. 1.5 is super low for anywhere that doesn't have a grad program. 3) Top schools it might be 1/1, 2/1 at mid-range, and 2/2 at most. And those are all lecture + lab courses. 1.5 does not seem right, I think your friend is wrong. 4) No. Much higher. 5) my load is 21.5 credit hours/year but labs are only counted for 2.5 credit hours instead of 3, and I teach 4 labs/year, so it's really 23.5. Plus I have 60 advisees and 5 research students. It's a lot. 6) I teach 12 ""contact hours"" per semester. It translates into 12 hours in the classroom per week. That's dispersed over lecture and lab; in some semesters, that means 1 class (a large class with several lab sections), in other semesters, it's 2 classes (with one lab section each). 7) Many very good SLACs (like top 50 rankings) have 2/3 loads. At some places you might be able to count some research with students and advising to drop that a bit but 1.5 is very low except for at very few with huge endowments. 8) The SLAC where a friend works has 15 contact hours per year (3/2 load) plus advising and working with research students. 9) I had campus interviews at two highly ranked SLACs and both had very reasonable teaching loads - one of them you taught your speciality upper division course during one semester and 1/3 of the intro bio course the other semester, and at the other you taught 1-2 courses a semester, or if you did an intensive one over the January term then one during the others. Some of these included labs and maybe a discussion group or seminar on top of that. It wasn't much different than a research university. I think this only applies to elite SLACs and other PUIs you should expect 2-2 at a minimum, likely more","If I had a dime for every time I interviewed, failed, asked for feedback, and heard “you have a great CV, keep at it, you’ll get a job!”, I’d be passing out positions to my fellow venters.  Three years into interviewing, I appreciated this comment.  Now that I am in my seventh year of interviewing, it ticks me off.  It conveys a sense of faith in the meritocracy that suggests that the speaker is not paying attention.  I have a good CV and I do good work.  These are necessary, not sufficient, conditions for getting a job.  The tiniest of hurdles and the smallest dollops of bad luck deflect a lot of talent.  This field is graduating too many PhDs, with too few jobs within but especially outside academia, not to understand that!  So now I appreciate this comment “You have a great CV, it was a hard choice, I can’t give you advice that will improve your chances, thus, you have to decide whether it is worth another year when every year’s chances are slim.”  And, yes, some faculty have the self-awareness to spell this out. 2) I feel this vent 100% and had a very similar experience where for a few years this didn't bother me, but 6 years out of PhD I can't stand hearing this. I would extend it beyond search committees to advisors and colleagues too though. I know they mean well, but I have heard sooo many: 'oh your record is so strong, you'll definitely get a job, its just a numbers game, I don't have any suggestions to improve your application, all your materials look great and you should be competitive for every job""....but still no job. I'd rather they would just say 'I'm so sorry that the job market sucks' and leave it at that unless they actually have specific advice for improvement.  3) That happened to me and I later found out one rec letter was bad.  That may not be the case for you, but I would take the chance to shuffle your recs if you can.  Apply to at least 1 job with one rec missing.  The fact that you have been on the market so long and not gotten a job may be concerning if you genuinely have more first author papers than others who are landing positions. If you see someone in person at a conference, explain that you still haven't landed a job.  Ask for frank and constructive advice.  They may be more forthcoming when time has passed that it isn't a COI.  Keep applying and I hope something works out.  4) OP is getting interviews, which suggests the rec letters are fine. 2) lol 3. Thanks for demonstrating my point. 5) Is something happening at the interview stage? How many on-campus have you had with no offer? 6) OP, I was just having this conversation with several people the other day, and I share these same frustrations. 7) I don't take the initial rejection personally (no interview), but after meeting all those people over 1-2 days, it is definitely more of a 'what did I do wrong? is it something about me or something about my science, or both?' and it feels like things like age or personality (things you can't necessarily change about yourself!) often come into play ","negotiating/accepting an offer during an economic crisis I feel very fortunate to have a job offer right now, but am concerned that the terms of the offer are substantially worse due to the economic crisis. I have funding in my current position for at least another year. Any thoughts or advice about whether to take the job or wait out the economic crisis in hopes of a better offer in the future? 2) Is there any reason to think that it would be harder to apply for a better position from your current position than it would be from the offered position? Some people think it's easier to apply for faculty positions as an AP than as a postdoc or other NTT role.  Next year's job market is likely to be pretty soft.  Neither of these are intended to say that you should accept the offer, just things to think about. 3) OP-- Thanks for your insight. I'm not sure if I'll be in a better position to apply for a job in my current role or as an AP, but my current salary is much higher than what's being offered by my new prospective employer. 4) Just met with the Associate Dean at a big R1 yesterday who said that next year's job market will of course be limited, but they expect the next 2-3 years to be limited as well. Then there will be a glut of candidates applying due to several poor market years.  5) Yes, take the offer.  Things aren't going to be better any time soon.  Even this offer might evaporate. 6) Is the housing market/cost of living comparable between the two positions? Sometimes the salary difference winds up being a wash when you factor that in (of course might not apply to your situation).  In any case I don't think a pay/stability (or pay/independence) tradeoff has an obvious answer, probably depends highly on your personal financial circumstances and responsibilities. 7) I was in your same position 2 weeks ago and I took the job. I think you should too. Unless the offer is so bad, you won't be able to be successful. But the advice I have been given is a. it's easier to get a TT job from a TT job and b. the academic market is going to be a mess the next few years and probably won't ever go back to ""the way it was"" (think pre- and post- 2008 crash)."
"Part of a failed search Remarkable. Five candidates brought in and none fit what you were looking for? Certainly I can look back and there were things that I could have done better but there was never any indication that things didn't go pretty well on my end. Hell, the department chair even said that it came down to how the remaining candidate did and that things on my end were more than great. Doubt it was my research, I have a comparable publication record to any of their ecology faculty . Certainly seemed like I got along with everyone well. Was my teaching lecture really that bad? That certainly wasn't suggested by what the instructor for the class said, nor by the behavior of the faculty sitting in but it must have been. Great, another year in a city my wife has hated since I started my PhD here and another year of uncertainty for me. What the hell were you looking for? (1) That's usually the problem: they didn't know what they were looking for. This happens all the time, actually, I'd argue that it happens the majority of the time with any decision by commitee. It's not you, it's them. (2) What Job? (3) Amazing spin here, it turns out ""they didn't know what they were looking for"" not ""they didn't find what they were looking for. Which has more experience evaluating applicants: tenured members of a SC, or some post-doc that's never held a real position on a faculty? We need to stop pointing the finger out, and do a little self-evaluation/improvement. Wah. (4) I agree with 3. See the post below (2-27 UOP) for anything that needs to be said about this. Maybe you did nothing wrong, and the dean pulled the position. You likely will never know. Although I do feel your pain about the spousal stress...that adds a lot to my plate too. Not blaming her for how she feels by any means, but it sure doesn't lighten the load. (5) To ""3"" I'm the original poster and didn't say anything about them not knowing what they were looking for, I simply concluded by asking what they were looking for. I really don't know - as the fourth person brought in I can confidently say it wasn't me or four others - but that really doesn't indicate what it was they were looking for. It is frustrating to have everything go well based on what others say and by what you're told and then have a failed search declared. As for some post-doc never having had a real position knowing less than the tenured members of a SC, you're right to a degree (though 3 of the 5 on the SC didn't have tenure yet) and I will continue to publish and improve my lecturing ability, though I think I did well with less than a week's notice for my first interview and for only the second faculty job I've applied for. Nonetheless it is frustrating to have no idea what they were looking for based on either the ad or by the interactions during the interview process. I also wonder in this case (and have wondered while being a student member of SC's) whether any of those on the SC would actually hire themselves. (6) OP, #3 again...you can see if you look that my reply was to #1, not your vent. [[OP: I figured but wanted to be clear. I liked everyone I met at UoP and didn't want it to seem otherwise.]]
7) Let’s keep things objective (sorry, this is not really directed at addressing the OP’s vent, but more the snarky comments that followed by multiple posters). The fact is that the applicant pool is as deep as it has ever been. Another fact is that they (UoP) had many (dozens, hundreds?? IDK final count) of applications to find at least 1 person. Another fact is that it was a failed search that was not because all the candidates declined offers. Adding it all up, does it really matter if they didn’t KNOW what they were looking for or if they didn’t FIND what they were looking for? I don’t think so. The SC’s job was to find a good candidate to fill a need of the department. Mission unaccomplished! Debating why this was the case isn’t as important as the fact it failed despite the extremely rich applicant pool, which no matter how you cut, reflects poorly on everyone including the applicants (myself included), the SC, the dept, and the university. Hooray, we all lose. (8) Unfortunately, a deep pool is not the same as a rich pool. It depends what qualities the SC was looking for. Maybe the SC failed at their job, but unless they went out soliciting apps, they may not have had a choice. As the old-timers say, you can't make chicken soup out of chicken shit. If all they got to choose from were poor fits (me included before you get mad that I called you chicken shit), they can't pull a good fit out of that pool. Maybe we all were perfect fits, but the funding got cut. Who knows? (9) Turns out funding was not cut. (10) Are you the OP, 9? What job are we talking about? People started bringing up UOP again, but I don't think they had 5 candidates. (11) Yes and I found out funding wasn't cut. UoP did bring in five candidates. The first three were not chosen among (see below, I'd rather not speculate why). Two more were brought in (me and someone else), neither of whom had an offer extended to them. I didn't apply for many jobs (only two) because I would like something rather permanent since my wife has a career too and so was really excited to be brought in for this one even if I wasn't one of their top choice. (12) ""you can't make chicken soup out of chicken shit""--That's another great line I learned from this wiki besides ""douchebaggery"".
(13)  I'd like to rephrase the DB chicken comment as something more realistic:  ""you can't make a roasted pheasant out of filet mignon"".  Seriously, to think that, in this market, there are not top people applying for every single job?  Furthermore, however mistaken the SC was, they selected candidates based on some measure of excellence.  The candidates also demonstrated their quality during the phone interviews.  The SC simply did not use the correct criteria for what the rest of the department wanted/needed.  You can't expect super-teachers if you choose your interviewees by number of publications and research grants, and you can't expect tip-top researchers if your criteria are teaching awards and independent instruction.  Furthermore, you don't invite field ecologists if you don't want somebody spending lots of time in the field, and you don't invite molecular biologists if you're not willing, or able, to set up lab facilities. (14) You also don't invite bird and/or mammal researchers for a bird and/or mammal position and expect them to work in the lab if your university can't house such animals on campus. That effectively prevents them from doing lab work. If you then don't want them doing field work...","U New Hampshire is maple syrup slower than molasses? Any of the 7 applicants that have been contacted by the SC heard anything more? I heard that there were some budget issues-- Help! This thing is dragging on... 2) I'm one of the 7 and I haven't heard a thing. I assumed I was out (refs not contacted), so it's somewhat comforting to hear that others have had similar experiences.3) I just sent an e-mail to the search coordinator (4/14) -- I'll post when I hear back. 3 again). in response to my inquiry -- the short list for at least one the of the positions (aquatic biogeochemistry) has been sent to the dean for approval. The status for all other candidates should be known by the end of the week. 4?) Thanks, OP here- any news is refreshing. 5) any news on these??? 6) I heard that the forest ecology position was the only position that hadn't moved to interview. Any others? 7) Anyone who scheduled an interview, which position did you apply for? 8) Search coordinator told me all positions had been sent to admin for invite list and then people would be notified...polite way of saying no thanks???",NA,NA,"Does everyone have to go through postdoc hell? Please tell me your worst postdoc story, because misery loves company. So far, mine involves lawyers and money, but no guns. I use a gun in my post doc sometimes. But that's heaven not hell. (2) I'm on my second fabulous postdoc. I love it, except that I have a weekly 3 hour commute by plane, preceeded or followed by a 2 hour drive. Postdoc is great, missing my family not so much. 3) I've been postdoc'ing since 2006, on the market almost every year since, with more and more interviews every year yet NO OFFERS. I'm getting out of academia after pouring in my blood, sweat, and tears (literally), and I can't be more relieved. Join me! Check out www.howtoleaveacademia.com. It made me feel a lot better about my decisions. So long, suckas! (4) No, everyone doesn't go through postdoc hell.  But, many who opt for crap schools in liue of a postdoc end up going through tenure track hell.  i made this mistake when out-and-out lied too by the search committee, dean, chair. (5) Like Margaret Cho said during a botched colon flush, ""everyone's (postdoc hell) is a little bit different."" I made a major field transition in my postdoc and have realized how bad of a decision it was. Not the worst, but definitely had major consequences on my ability to succeed from here (e.g., retarded my publication rate). I am considering leaving academia ultimately and trying to find the right exit strategy. Basically, the academic life issue is placing a lot of strain on my relationship and I don't care enough about my career to sacrifice my relationship over it. The worst thing that has happened during my postdoc has been being at an Ivy. These people are... the worst. (6) my worste involves not taking one.  I had a very very good postdoc offer at a asst prof salary rate with all benefits paid, I had not even applied for it, the prof emailed me direct.  I interviewed for it, would have spent 4 mo in Kenya, 3 mo on the Pacific Ocean, and 3 months in the states.  Very high profile research.  I got offered a TT job at a school that lied up and down about its financial condition, teaching loads, my responsibilities.  I took the TT job because so many things were looking up.  Guess what?  THe guy who took the postdoc is now a PHD professor in a high profile position, and I got let go after 18 mo because the school could not afford photocopying.  I got lucky in a way, but had jump to another similar institution in a bad market year.  That school let me go because the school mismanaged the budget so badly.  I saw this one coming thought.  There are worse things than an extended postdoc, like having to try to explain how you were let go from a TT job where they don't want the world to know they are impoverished, so they simply lie about you.  YEs, it happens. IT seems many schools that let go TT professors would rather tell prospective employers the person stunk than simply say we had some budget issues. ","How do people handle multiple job prospects when you are further along in the interview process for one job, but you really want the second job? Do you flat out tell them you are waiting to go to another interview before you can make any decision? To clarify, no offer has been made, but if it comes, it will come before the other interview. 1) I am in the same situation, will be watching to see what people say. 2) IMHO, try to stretch it out the decision/negotiation as much as possible. They can't retract the offer, but can give a deadline for a decision.  At the other interview tell them you have received an offer elsewhere with a pressing deadline on a decision, but you are more interested in the position at this school.  It may help them speed up a offer (or that an offer is coming with an ""unofficial"" offer).  3) Yes, they can retract the offer.  When I was a PHD student, they retracted the offer on a candidate who pittled around for almost 12 wks. 4) They may retract the offer much sooner...especially if the second candidate is also a good fit and sense delay on your part. Also depends on the institution. Some schools don't have much to negotiate (SLACs) so negotiations should take only a couple of weeks at most. 5) Under the law, they cannot retract an offer, but they can give you a short deadline to make a decision/negotiate.  If you don't make a decision by the deadline, you've essentially declined the offer.  It's a buyer's market out there...good luck! 6) ""Under the law, they cannot retract the offer"": if you're using the time to negotiate, they certainly can.  Any counter-offer is a rejection of the original offer.  7) Adding support to comments 3, 4, and 6.  They absolutely can retract the offer.  An offer is not a contract.  It would be very bad form to retract an offer without good reason, but the offerer has this right.  More importantly in the real world, #6's point is essential: As soon as you start negotiating, you have officially rejected their offer.  At that point there is nothing to retract; you have rejected the first offer and all the offerer has to do is decline to make a second offer.  It does not happen often, but there are horror stories in academia of this happening.  Now, on to the main question: If you haven't yet interviewed at place #2, I think it's unlikely that you'll be able to stretch things out much.  If you were waiting for offer from #2 after an interview, that might be one thing, but you could be talking about many weeks between your interview for job #2 and when they make their decision, and most institutions are going to be unwilling to wait that long.  Most places will give you a few weeks max, unless you're really a big shot and have a big decision to make. 8) How do they handle them?  With great joy! With great joy!! 9) OP, thanks for the insight! 10) Wow, it sure must be nice!
11) I agree with #2. There's no point to tipping off school 1 until they have made you an offer, which will probably be informal. Then it is totally normal to ask for a second visit to check on the lab space, living situation, etc. Often the formal offer will come at or after the second visit -- it can take longer than you'd think. Let school 2 know that you're expecting / have received an offer from school 1, so they can move fast (and so you look ""hot""). Hopefully school 1's deadline hasn't come yet, but school 2 can usually at least let you know when they will decide. If you need to string out school 1, just ask for an extension. They *could* retract their offer, but that'd be weird and a sign that school 1 isn't a great place to be anyhow. In most cases school 1 will just tell you that their deadline is firm. With any luck you're not still waiting on school 2 at this point, but if you are, you have three crappy options: i) take school 1's offer, decline 2, and live with it; ii) decline school 1's offer and hope for the best with 2; iii) take school 1's offer, keep 2 alive and bail on 1 if 2 pans out. Under i) you'll always be wondering what might have been; ii) is a big ass risk; and iii) can be seen as slimy. Personally, I don't know what I would do, but I have heard of all three options being used. Good luck! 12) I took the first job because I didn't have a backup plan if both options fell through for whatever reason. I wasn't in the position to risk unemployment.  13) Thanks for the update, OP.  Now forget about the search process and focus on making the most of your new position.  Congrats!

What should I be wearing? Normally I come to work with a tshirt. But I want to maximize my odds to take the jobs, so I agree to wear anything. Can you give me suggestions? (links to photos may also help) 2) Is there a particular gender we are aiming our suggestions toward? OP) Male. 3) Suit is probably overkill.  Look at faculty profiles on the website and aim for a step or two up from there.  I am female, but once got rejected because I dressed nice enough that the interviewing panel didn't believe I knew how to do anything field-related. 2 again) Assuming you're doing a 2 day interview:  For the day you are NOT giving your talk, you can take do a business casual type outfit, for example: http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--vT6HCLsC--/191dedl4d8kj8jpg.jpg ... This is probably fine for the day you give your talk too, but it might be a good idea to go a little more formal, throwing a sport coat over it like this: http://scene7.josbank.com/is/image/JosBank/6401_000_main?defaultImage=JosBank/6401_000_main&iv=D-Saa1&wid=394&hei=455 .  I would steer away from suits and ties, as I think they are a bit too formal for most departments.  One problem I've noticed a few times on guys that don't normally dress up is that they wear dress shirts that are way too big, which can make them look a little sloppier.  If you are in doubt, I would go to a store where they can measure you and steer you to the right fit.  Go with black or brown shoes that are comfortable and look professional without being super fancy or pointy: http://www.zappos.com/ecco-seattle-apron-toe-tie-cognac-smooth-full-grain-leather .  Lastly, wear the clothes around the house for a few hours before the interview to make sure they are comfortable.  I wore a pair of pants that were uncomfortable to sit in at one of my interviews and it was a long day.  4) I always wear a sport coat, tie, and khakis. I always wear the tie on the days I meet with deans and/or give talks. Sometimes that is one day other times it is two. 5) I definitely say bring a tie and coat... but not necessarily a suit. If it's at a med school, you have to wear a suit. If it's a research university that isn't a med school, a jacket is necessary but the tie is optional. You *must* wear a coat (and preferably a tie) when you meet anyone in admin. That is pretty much standard at an R1 if you expect to be taken seriously. 6) I wear a suit. I think you are making a mistake if you wear any less than dress pants and a jacket, preferably with a tie. Yes, this sucks. I am field oriented person and have interviewed from SLACS to R1. You need to be the best dressed person in the room. I served on a hiring committee and they felt (male) candidates that did not at least wear a jacket were not taking the interview seriously enough. Best of luck! 7) I love that it takes more than a decade of effort (undergrad, grad school, postdocs, VAP position, etc) to get a TT interview, and the SC lets presence/absence of a jacket/tie influence the decision process.  I've actually been told by a SC chair before NOT to wear a jacket for the interview.  Can we start a new data page on ""Worn during interview"" to see if there's relationships between presence/absence of jacket and being offered the job? 8) I used to worry about this but I don't think it matters - for intro positions in ecology - avoid suits - With or without a tie is fine, with or without a jacket is fine. The most important thing is that you appear confident and comfortable (that is, you are comfortable in talking/engaging with anyone from a Dean to a graduate student, not that your clothes are comfortable). (OP) Thank you all for the answers! I guess I'll neet to buy a coat/jacket, pants and maybe a tie... My feeling is that it will not matter for most people but the case is asymmetric: the 90% that won't care, won't care either way; the 10% that might care, are those that expect me to wear a coat... Let me know if you have suggestions for brands, I'll probably need to buy everything except my underwear and maybe my clock. 10) I like the jacket and tie approach. You should go with what makes you feel confident. I am field ecologist to the core but feel important and confident when dressed up. Maybe that makes me a shallow person. I have to go to an online tutorial everytime I tie a tie. I do think you should be the best dressed person in the room. However, it didn't go over too well when I wore a top hat and tails at the last interview. Also, as with a lot of aspects of an interview, it is not that some people really care but there is a lot of cognitive biases in the interview processes (we all have them). My unfounded opinion is that if you have a career of running through the muck and mud to study some obscure eco/evo idea, you probably aren't a stuffy suit person and the committee knows that. The jacket and tie signal seriousness. (11) Most interviews are 2 days, get two different suits/shirts/ties. It sucks, it's expensive, you may never wear them again...however, you will stand out (in a good way) and there will be no question about your level of professionalism. I'm a field person and the whole suit-tie thing was awkward as hell (at first). Now, it's part of getting into interview mode. I've always had the opportunity to change out of my suit into something more casual/comfortable for dinner. As others have commented, make sure you are professionally fitted and the suit is tailored to you (e.g., Men's Warehouse). I can remember male candidates interviewing during my PhD who looked like Doogie Howser in their poor-fitting coats. Last year, this was not my approach, but following a campus interview for a position I didn't get, the only feedback I received concerned my clothes (dress pants and tie both days). Your appearence is perhaps the ONE THING that is in your control, so don't take it lightly. Anyone can dress down, and ecologist seem to take this to the extreme. Make a statement and be memorable for the right reasons. 12) I will also say that wearing a watch is extremely important. That is a business trick. 13) Like some have said, consider your audience. There is no uniform for interviews or we would all know about it. My first interview at an R1 was in a forestry and wildlife department. I wore a nice button-down shirt, a sport coat, and nice looking jeans (yes that's right, jeans... and no watch). I had a message with the job offer when my plane landed back home. I doubt it had much to do with my clothes, but if you show up in a wildlife department with a suit and tie, you'll look pretty douchey. So, to reiterate, consider your audience. Be the best dressed person in the room but don't dress like your interviewing to be their lawyer. 13) I'll add my two cents - if you wore it to a wedding/funeral its not appropriate. A casual, well-fitting sport coat, nice slacks and a dress shirt with reasonably nice shoes should do fine in most situations. A tie that isn't too flashy can be Ok, I've got a tie with my study organism that tends to get smiles. Most important is that it is comfortable, doesn't make you to flashy but doesn't give the appearance that you could care less. It should make you feel great wearing it. Funny story - on my last interview I flew overseas and didn't heed the conventional wisdom to carry on/wear what you're going to on the day of the interview. Since it was a 24 hour travel I thought that would be gross. Of course my bag didn't arrive until the afternoon my interview was going on. Luckily I did bring some comfortable black jeans, a button down shirt and a grey sweater that looked smart but wasn't overly dressy. People had tremendous sympathy however so I don't think it counted against me. 14) I have been interviewing back in the US from overseas, and I was SO paranoid about that happening that I did all carry-on luggage only. It was a pain, but would have died worrying while traveling otherwise. 15)  I have witnessed several (4) interviews at R1 forestry, fisheries and wildlife departments and wearing a suit is definitely not a disqualifier in these departments.  In fact, it was the norm overall for men and in one particular department, the department chair expected it.  If you are trying to decide, I think fit is more important as others have said.  This is actually a great topic.",You probably have better chances if you can spell tomato.  ;),"h'...? Can someone enlighten me as to what the h' column in the Anon Quals sheet means? Feeling really dumb right now. 2) h-index, which is part of one's Google Scholar profile and a way to essentially put a number to someone's publication record. h is the number that combines both the number of papers and how often they have been cited (an h-index of 5 means one has 5papers that have been cited at least 5 times, even if one has 10 others that have been cited 4 times each). In my experience, it's mostly the old farts that think this is truly important. x2 OP) thanks! I'll go update it now. 3) I am not sure if I agree with #2. H-index is biased towards older researchers (old farts will have higher h-index), but to me seems like younger to mid-career people are paying more attention to this and other sorts of metrics to measure research impact. 4) When did people stop actually reading papers? 5) 2010? 6) I've never seen h-index used in a junior search, because it has an inherent time-delay of at least a couple years (time for a paper to be read by others, then cited in papers that take time to write and get accepted and published), too much variance in the early years, and gives equal weight to a sole author paper and a 12th-out-of-24-authors paper.  My rough look at CVs is to divy papers into 1st author vs non-1st author and decent vs indecent journals, then calculate the number of 1st author decent pubs per year since phd+1 (don't want to divide by zero!).

So, I'll annonymously post here about him being of questionable character and let these two vague posts cancel each other out in the universe. 2) sorry to hear that OP. that sucks. just keep being awesome. 3) +1 for cosmic karma 4) I'd say that person is pretty miserable as is... having that attitude is a punishment in itself for both social and professional aspects of life.   5) Ignore them.  And keep flipping through those interview invitations when you feel down. 6) I would just respond, ""candidates do not determine who is superior or inferior...search committees make that decision."" 6) I support your cosmic karma! 7) I used to share an office with a character just like that! 8) Had to look up the word 'vaguebooking' lol x2 9) I'm reminded of the notion that when you are accustomed to privledge (e.g., males in academics), equality feels like oppression. If he's mad that he's not getting interviews, my response is...welcome to the club kid! Sounds like an asshole in any event. 10) Males in academics? How about everywhere? Funny how everyone thinks that all the stuff that we go through is unique to academia. If anything, it's worse out there in the real world. 11) Duh. 12) So you think the process is fair? I'm not trying trying to defend your male colleague (he sounds like a douche), but even after landing a job this year, I'm pretty darn disillusioned with the process.","negotation etiquette I've never been in a sittuation where I had to negotiate. So, this might sound a naive question. I am little confused about the right etiquette. Dept Chair called 4 days ago to extend the offer and asked to provide list of things I need in the lab. I sent the list to him in 3 days (yesterday). Should I wait for further instructions now? I would like to see if I can have a better salary, moving expenses, teaching release, etc. When is the right moment to go through all this without either being too late or pissing the Chair off? 2) As far as I know, it would be unusual for you to negotiate salary, etc with the Dept. Chair. That's usually something that goes through the Dean. It may be worth asking him who you'll be negotiating with so you know who to talk to. 3) Here #1. Thanks! In fact, the Chair said I should receive a formal offer from the Dean but I haven't seen anything. No rush on my side though.. 4) Currently negotiating for a position entirely with the dept. char, fwiw 5) same as 4 - my understanding for most jobs is that the chair is the middle (wo)man between you and the dean x3 6) Through some stupid stroke of luck, I have three competeing job offers. I am negotiating with the Deans office for all 3. 7) Wow, way to go! x2 8) Negotiated with the department head for my next/upcoming position","After this application season, I made a firm decision to pursue an industry job next year rather than an academic job. Before any judging, let me just say that according to my peers I was qualified for and on track for an academic job (30 papers, several grants, 3 yrs postdoc experience). This decision to leave also meant that I canceled an on-site interview, which in previous years I would have been thrilled to attend. Basically, it all just stopped making sense to me. I have plenty of good and bad things to say about academia, but a recent article about burnout (https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/annehelenpetersen/millennials-burnout-generation-debt-work) really resonated with me. It seemed to me that more than anything, I really wanted the validation of 'getting the job' because I've put a considerable amount of time, energy, and my life into this career path (and don't I deserve it?). Thinking through a lot of this has been painful and difficult, but as I have detached from the academic bubble in various ways I do feel like I have a better perspective. Recently I started to connect with other former grad students and postdocs who have industry jobs, and all of them are overall happy with their lives and satisfied with their current jobs. They each gave me an overview of what they do and their perspective on making the transition. This has been very inspiring, and made me realize skill set I've developed over the past couple years is extremely valuable and highly sought after in industry. When I compare these opportunities to those that await in academia, it seems like an obvious choice now - but it took me a long time to reach this decision. A lot of what I have read on this wiki relates to wondering if all of this is actually worth it, feeling stressed out and anxious about the future, and how difficult or unfair academia can be. If these sound like things you have also been thinking about, it's important that you know you aren't alone. It can be difficult to think about these topics, especially the question of whether to leave or not, and what you ultimately decide to do depends on a lot of factors. I'm certainly not recommending everyone should leave academia, but questioning it is healthy. If you've been on the fence about academic life, I found the Next Gen PhD book to be very helpful, and it might be a good place to start. After committing to this decision, I finally feel like I have control over my life again and I am very optimistic about the future. 2) Good for you and thanks for sharing! I am going through a similar transition, having realized that the academic path doesn't make much sense. There are numerous articles on why we continue to pursue these paths, and great articles on burnout like you listed. The frightening thing for me is that I know nothing about industry, how to get a job...etc. Luckily, My Uni has a  workshop series on this topic and it has been incredibly helpful. I am hanging with 50 other postdocs and late-stage PhDs and we are figuring it out together. I have had one phone interview so far in three weeks of applying - that is 25 % of the interview volume I had in two years on the academic job market. Best of all the starting salary for the position was better than academics and the work was 40 hours a week! I am continually connecting with old colleagues that have left academia in informational interviews and asked them all the same question: do you have any regrets? They all report that they don't. I am not sure that is true of the people with TT positions. Keep going and good luck to you! You deserve a great position and I am sure you will find one. 3) I made the jump for all the same reasons as #1 (although I still check here just in case there's a perfect academic job).  I'm super happy, and working in industry makes you feel like you actually are valuable.  It also gets to the point where companies are calling you offering jobs, which is such a 180 from academia.  And they pay is double if not more than a lot of academic jobs in addition to genuine work life balance (at most places).  One you step out academia rapidly loses it's allure IMO. 4) @3, what area of industry do you work in? 4) I have a similar CV and I too have come to this decision because: ""Basically, it all just stopped making sense to me."" I undertook an academic pursuit for 2 reasons. First, I wanted a job that would afford me the flexibility to enjoy having a family. Second, I wanted a job where I could use science to solve global human and environmental problems. I  had participated in a post-baccalaureate program abroad where I saw european academic researchers using science to solve problems. I found this inspiring. It seemed like getting a PhD, getting a faculty position, and getting grants was the way to go. However, the longer I have been in academia (4th year of PD) the less sense that academia makes for acheiving those goals. 5) My take: I believe that academia, just like industry, is ultimately a selfish pursuit that satisfies our need to live comfortable, self-actualized lives and ensure a steady paycheck. If I really scrutinize mine and most of my peers' research programmes, yes, we are indeed generating knowledge to potentially inform and improve human wellbeing. However, when you get down to it, our individual contributions are, in the overwhelming majority of cases, immaterial to acheiving those ends. We are all better off going into industry to invent shit, running for office, or becoming famous youtube educators if we want to meaningfully benefit society. 6) Making a bunch of money and donating it would have a greater impact on society than being a postdoc. Futhermore, all the free time I would have not working 55 hours a week could be used for volunteering. Making an impact isn't a reason for staying in academia over other positions. 7) But if I leave academia, I will lose my fabulous research program and lots of overseas travel opportunities.  As a field biologist, I'm having a hard time envisioning a job where I'd be able to have the adventures I have now. 8) Universities will suck the life out of you anyway with committees, meetings, listening to bullshit from deans, provosts, you name it, while wondering when an anti-evolutionist/climate change lunatic will start shooting up faculty goaded on by the university administation. So yeah take the industry job, not everyone can take an industry job, most of academia is dead because of no funding. So, I bet your future won't be a dead end. Take it and live it. 8) The popgen and microbial people seem to have figured this out already, with many leaving TT posts for industry. 9) For real. I wish I had more microbial experience. A friend of mine in with metagenomic experience left for industry last year and their signing bonus was more than I will ever make in a year. I am happy for them! They totally made the right moves. 10) My overall experience is that academia is always trying to find flaws in you, whether that is in peer-review, presentations, committee meetings, or (especially) the job search. Basically anyone who receives a PhD, has published a paper, and has taught courses is qualified for a majority of TT jobs, yet there are so many of us applying that search committees are just looking for flaws in the smallest details. It is crazy. My experience interviewing for industry positions has been very positive - it's more like a conversation to determine your skill set and personality. Companies have strong incentives to place talented people in their workforce, and once they identify a great candidate they work hard to figure out a place where they will fit. And even if you don't get that job, assuming everything went well the company will have you on the short list for the next time a job comes up. There are also recruiters that can help identify opportunities - these are people that get paid to get you hired! As #3 mentioned, once you get established companies will try to recruit you for other positions. It really does seem like a different world, and to be honest, a much better one. I know it may feel like there are only opportunities for genomics, bioinformatics, or microbial focused researchers, but the reality is anyone with a PhD built on some quantitative research can become a data scientist or even work for a think-tank. There is actually a great post below about the Insight Data Science Fellowship, definitely worth reading. The most important thing you can do is start 'informational interviews', which is a fancy way of saying: ask your friends, colleagues, or strangers who have a job you may want what they do, how they got there, and what advice they have for you to get to this type of job. This is a scary step, but also a very important way to move forward. In my experience so far, everyone has been more than enthusiastic to give advice and try to help, especially those who have also left academia (they know what you've been through!). I have a year left in my current position, but I have been learning a ton and already had three interviews based on three applications. I am very glad I tested the industry waters, and I am definitely taking the plunge! 11) This is all really great to hear. Also... just take a look at the number of total posts in the 'positive affirmation' vs. 'venting' tabs... it looks like there are a LOT of unhappy people in academia... let's all jump to industry! 12) This is not to advocate for one direction over the other (disclosure: tenured faculty writing), but something to consider in the equation is job stability.  Biotech companies start up, merge, are bought out, and fold all the time.  That kind of uncertainty and transience, as most of us have experienced, can be very stressful, especially for those with dependents.  13)  Grass is always greener on the other side. Plenty of industry jobs might seem appealing, but there easily could be the same -or greater -push for results and productivity. It is profit driven after all. Basically all jobs taht require advanced degrees are going to come increased responsibilities and generally higher stress levels at times. 14) I don't think anyone's saying that industry jobs are less stressful. Just that they can be as or more rewarding than TT positions and many don't recieve the 100+ applications that most good TT job ads do. 15) @12, that is a valid point but there is definitely no shortage of companies and jobs available (versus the extreme scarcity of TT jobs). If a company you work for fails, you are highly qualified with industry experience, vouched for, and able to move around to other similar positions very easily. I am interviewing for a bioinformatics position right now where the team is having a difficult time hiring because each time they've invited a candidate for an on-site interview, they've already accepted another offer. Many are fighting for scraps in academia, willing to take sub-optimal jobs. I know a few TT faculty who weren't happy about their first position and have been trying to 'level up' to a better TT job without any success. I've heard once you get a TT job, it's easier to move around, but I know a lot of cases where that hasn't been true. As for job stability, I'm on my third postdoc and every time I've moved across the country my bank account was drained. In industry, you can stay in the same city and change jobs without the major life changes required in academia. I agree the grass is always greener and there are definitely cons working in industry, but there is no denying that the number of jobs available in academia vs. industry is heavily skewed and there are simply more opportunities in industry. If your dream is academia, go for it, but many of us have to consider a different reality. 16) @13, but at least you are getting paid your worth. I think many of us enjoy working hard (or we wouldn't have come this far), but don't actually know the monetary value of our work. 17) Thanks to the person who bold each comment. We should do that for every thread! X4","EB green card Has anyone on the wiki gone through the self-sponsored EB1 or EB2 process? 1) I looked into it (met with an immigration lawyer). She thought it would be possible for a stratightforward case to do it myself, but someone else I know doing it now lawyered up. Getting the external letters seemed ike the biggest hurdle for me. I decided against it (leaving the US) 2) Thanks! Were you going to do it yourself due to cost? 3) Yep, was looking at 5-10k and she said it was possible to do yourself if you stay on top of things. 3) I was going to do it myself, and had everything ready.  But with the current administration and everything that has been going on immigration-wise i was strongly advised by many people to go with the layer because I am on J-1 and the J-1 is 100% non-immigrant and if  your EB2 petiotion fails and you are under J-1 you have to leave the Country.  IF you are on H1-B you can instead take the chance and worst case scenario remain on H1-B and you just lost the money of the Fees. 4) Ah that makes sense. I wasn't on J1. 5) Yep, I am waiting for my (currently delayed) H1-B and then going to do it. I am going to suck it up and pay for a lawyer because I've already had trouble with my H-1B for a reason specific to my case. Good luck all! 5) A little off topic, but getting PR in Canada is WAY more straightforward than the US (and fast!), especially if you have a higher degree. I chose that option. 6) I know some Ph.D. students who did their own EB1 applications without a lawyer and got aprroved. It is possible to do it on your own, but if you want to be sure (since you are already paying >2K for application and PP), I think spending 5K for a lawyer is a good investment, especially in this era when checks are more stringent. 6) For I-140, I hired a lawyer who gives moneyback guranteee for good/strong cases, but saved some money by filing I485 on my own, as this part is a very straightforward process (filling some forms and preparing some documents). I recommend hiring an expereinced lawyer for I-140, as you will save a lot of time (in months).  7) I applied for EB1 and EB2 a few years ago. 5k for lawyer and about 5k for application fees to USCIS. It was a lot of money. If you are not from China or India, EB2 may be enough for you. Otherwise EB1 is almost essential since you normally wait for 1-3 year for EB1 rather than 5-10 years for EB2. Currently the bar of EB1 is quite high. Although you may always try your luck, normally you publications need to have 500-1000 citations to be approved. ","Just got an on campus interview! When? In six days. Immediately confirmed and asked for instructions (e.g. length of talk), but haven't heard from them yet. So if I'm lucky and they reply tomorrow, I'll have 4 days to prepare everything. Now add my sick kids and working partner. When am I supposed to prepare for this? 2) Sorry about this, but I think you can safely assume a research talk, which you probably already have some semblance of... Some places also require a teaching demo, so hopefully you find that out ASAP.  Other things, be prepared with a list of things you would need to get your lab set-up, some idea of what your short to slightly longer-term research plans are and the different mechanisms to fund those, look at the course catalog and offer specifics on courses you can teach, etc.  Once you get the schedule, look up all the people you are going to meet with to have some idea of the research they do, or if not research, the reason that this person is meeting with you.  Also, have questions.  Have questions for the committee, for the department chair, for the dean, for the research office, for anyone you might meet.  3) (OP) Thanks! I'm doing all research I can and have the basic job talk ready, but not a teaching demo, which I feel like it'd be a waste of time to start working on before knowing if it's needed (it's in the UK and I think it's less common). 4) I believe that, usually, the seminar lasts about any hour and you want to plan for a 40-45 minute talk and leave room for questions. I don't have much experience with this, but I think that general layout is standard. 5) (OP) Thanks everyone. Just got the email. 30 min talk focusing on research plan, and 15 min teaching demo on a topic they chose. 6)  I'm so sorry initial poster, that suuuucks!  Good luck.  If it makes you feel any better the same thing happened to me.  Just before the Thanksgiving holiday I was told I would have an interview the week after the holiday with a 50-minute research and class-lecture, then radio silence.  Ruined my Thanksgiving preparing for an interview that was not scheduled with the haste that was suggested.  In fact, the Chair contacted me the week before the Christmas holiday to give me the first week after THAT holiday to interview.  That interview actually came to fruition.  So the Chair ruined the Christmas holiday also. In the event you don't get the job, console yourself that giving six days notice is pretty much assuring that a very narrow slice of Americana is welcome as faculty and that they probably aren't treated very nicely when they get there.  Still, good luck!  7) @6 maybe a narrow slice of Britannia? OP said it's in the UK.  8) @7 Good point. I see that now. I tend to read these posts quickly and selectively because there is a lot of within-group anger that bums me out. Point still stands that an unreasonable interview process is discriminatory and may not lead to the best candidate.  9) In my limited experience, searches in the UK might be more likely to have a preferred candidate in the bunch. 10) Short notice is par for the course in the UK, but 6 days is shorter than usual.","Chalk talks in remote interviews I will have a chalk talk soon as part of a remote ""on-campus"" interview. Any insights about what to expect, how to prepare for it given the odd format, what not to do, etc? 2) Would general chalk talk tips be helpful, and/or extrapolations to what might happen in this format? I haven't done a remote chalk talk, but I've done several chalk talks."
"Censorship Is anyone else sad that the use of the word ""douchebag"" has been effectively banned on this wiki? :( 1) See comment #7 under RANT below.  2) I'm sad that the forum for useful information that this wiki used to be has become a haven for trolls. 3) #2, don't be sad.

Anyone know what happened? ,NA,NA,"ass of self A school in a desirable location for me posted a job ad I didn't really fit, but I applied anyways as a ""stretch"" application, and got rejected.  Now they've posted another ad I would be a much better fit for, but I'm worried I made an ass out of myself by applying for that first one.  Ugh!  I doubt there's any overlap in the readers of the applications.  If it was a stretch, they probably just tossed it after looking at your CV.  I know that some departments have the secretary or grad students do the first cull.  2) I have applied for two jobs in the same department for different things and been interviewed for both positions simultaneously on campus!  i would not worry about it. 3) Once I applied for a 'stretch', which I didn't get, but the following year that place contacted me to apply for a position for which I was a better fit!  However I had already accepted another position by then.(4) agreed - you should apply. you obviously have a lot of interest in the school, which is the most important part, and will reflect well, I think. Also, different set of people will be reading the applications","It's all scrambled! Someone really screwed up the notes, comments, interviews columns of the ""vacancies"" tab. Frustrating! A significant fraction of these important columns don't match the data. This just goes to show that you shouldn't sort the data unless you really know what you're doing. (2) Not convinced someone isn't doing it on purpose.  But maybe I just like to think you can't get a PhD without knowing how to sort data *facepalm* (3) Yeah, I just went to look and scared the crap out of myself.  But, Only part of it was messed up.  ","Just found out that one of the jobs at a SLAC I really wanted went to an internal candidate that I outstrip by multiple factors (teaching experience, publications with undergrads, mentoring experience, grants). Both of us ""got"" campus interviews and I was declared a ""shoe-in"" by multiple faculty at the institution. But OOPS! Nevermind! We want the other person that is already here. I understand why... the whole ""sure bet"" thing, but I think it's extraordinarily unfair and completely illogical. On paper, there is no way that they would have picked them over me. You wouldn't be able to justify it. So then it comes down to these other factors that you have absolutely no control over. If you want a tenure track job in academia, you just have to be willing to be more patient than the other people and just hope that you luck in to a department that is going to do what it can to keep you. Anyway... I just had to vent about this. It's been a really fucking hard year on the market (3rd in a row), and it's pretty dark on the horizon. I sometimes wonder what I will do to be fulfilled if this doesn't work out. I have been trying to think about it, but... it's just really hard. 2) Join the club. Also was ousted by a VAP, but I am leaving tomorrow for another interview with no VAP in sight. Good luck! 3) Maybe I am naive, but I think thats what VAP positions are for, to evaluate the candidate for 1-2 years. Usually if they like the person as a colleague and a friend, they would want him/her to continue on. Correct me if I am wrong. 4) OP again. No, most VAP positions are simply sabbatical replacements/term appointments (at least at SLACs; I know less about research schools). When they do transition into TT lines, it can go either way (retention of visitor or honest open call). There is no way to know which it is until you get to the interview for a VAP position. 5) #3 here. Thanks OP for the info. 6) There are also cases where VAPs don't want permanent jobs at their institutions, even if they match the job ad.  Or cases where VAPs get an offer before their institutions seals a deal with them.7) or cases where the VAPs don't get the positions due to political reasons in the department 8) OP again. Suffice to say a VAP who matches the job description should never be a reason for you NOT to apply for a job. 9) If it helps, I've been a VAP for the past three years and was NOT interviewed for the TT position.  But they already extended my VAP contract for another year.  So who knows what the heck people want?  I rocked an interview elsewhere last week so hopefully I'll be out of here come summer. 9) I'm not a VAP, and I don't have any desire to be one, either. But if they want to put in 1-3 years of teaching somewhere at low pay for the chance to have better odds when a TT position comes up at their institution, I have absolutely no problem with that. It is NOT a slam-dunk that they'll get hired to say on, so they're taking a big risk. If it pays off for them sometimes, more power to them, because the downside when it doesn't work out sounds crappy. 10) I interviewed at a place that went to an internal as well. It became obvious that they were just going through the motions. Such a waste of time....","Can you be overqualified? Someone said I should send a follow-up email (to everyone on the SC) after a phone interview- not just to say thank you, but to make another push for why I are the best person for the job- something like at least a page long, maybe longer.  What do you think? 2) I would give a hearty no to that suggestion.  To say thank you, sure.  Maybe to say one small thing you wish you'd said in the interview.  Even that I'm not sure.  But no one wants to read a page long email about why you should get the job - it will come across as either pushy or desperate.  Presumably they already have pages and pages of reasons to give you the job in the application itself. 3) No!  Something brief about what a pleasure it was to talk to them, and you've since thought xyz about something relevant and interesting, and wouldn't it be nice to talk about that again someday... look forward to hearing, and leave it at that. 4) I concur. No. That is a great way to come across as too pushy and desperate. Thank yous are nice and appropriate. I don't know who told you that, OP, but that is not good advice. 5) They already know who you are and your qualifications.  Now they are looking for more subtle things like ""fit"".  You want to appear confident, not desperate. 5) I wouldn't even send a thank you email after a phone interview. Say your thank yous at the end of the conversation and leave them alone unless and until you get selected for a campus interview. After THAT send thank you emails to each person you met with saying you enjoyed talking about x, y, and z with them. DO NOT restate why you should get the job. 6) Bullshit to #5. Terrible advice. I sent thank yous after phone interviews and in all 13 cases those transitioned to campus interviews. Thank yous are important and show that you are interested in the position after what you learned. 7) In my experience, sending thank yous after phone/skype interviews isn't necessary. If so, a quick one to the search maybe. Thank yous are important after the campus interview. I have gottten campus interviews after most (but not all) phone/skype interviews and have never sent a thank you. 8) a short email thanking the chair of the search committee for taking the time to talk is never a bad thing. 5 again) Jeez, 6, we are all just trying to help! Just say you disagree. What I said is not just BS. I purposefully did not send emails after my phone interviews (which also all resulted in on-campus interviews) because every single person I asked who had ever actually been on a faculty search said it is super annoying when candidates send emails all the time and that they didn't want to receive thank you emails from every single candidate after phone interviews. Some places do quite a lot of phone interviews, so I can see how that would be annoying, especially if the candidate send a page-long email pushing while they are the best (when they don't even know who the other candidates are). I've accepted an offer now, so I have nothing to gain by continued involvement with this wiki. Just trying to help others along because I know how hard it is, and comments from people like this make it less appealing to do that.

Does anyone have a sense of what might be different interviewing for a museum (i.e. assistant curator) position versus at a university?  Or do you know any resources to help with this? 2) The assistant curator job talks I've been to felt the same as your standard R1/R2 job seminars. While I don't know much about what happens behind the scenes in those cases, I imagine the major difference from a university position is that there wouldn't be much consideration for teaching aspects (if at all) such as course development. And the research focus of museum positions tend to be more on systematics and biodiversity inventory than anything else.   3) I have a museum job. It's the best. If the museum is strong, and it isn't just an honorific title, your service (and maybe your teaching) get shifted towards curation in terms of load. You NEED to demonstrate throughout that you are a museum person. That you generate specimens and that you have a specimen-based research program that will attract grad students and undergrads to use specimens in research. That needs to be clear in the cover letter, and in the research statement. But after you cross that threshold, at every stage, we are evaluating you like any other R1/R2 position. But again, on campus, you should expect to tour the collection. So do your homework. Figure out what they have that aligns with your research and ask to see that. Show that you know how to handle specimens. Give dog-whistles that you are part of the club, but don't let it distract from demonstrating your skills as a researcher and teacher. (But when you talk about teaching, you can bring up how the collection would be used in the classroom, etc.) 4) Thanks for the insight.  This question was actually intended for non-university associated museums.","Don't think you're having all the fun--you know me--I HATE EVERYONE! 2) You deleted Dude quotes to write that? 3) The force is strong with the OP 4) OP Here.

I am asking because I applied to a few, but never got any looks, and I am just wondering if it might be a waste of time applying to more next year. Thanks! 2) Yes! I have an EEB degree and just landed a job in an environmental sciences department. Im an organismal biologist but can sell my work well in the context of environmental change. 3)  I have an EEB degree and interviewed in an environmental science dept this job season.  Also had an EEB friend who got an offer from an environmental dept.  You just have to sell yourself in a more applied way 4) Thanks very much for the feedback, and congrats!","Dammit. Didn't get interviews at two places I applied. And time is running out. 2) Dammit. Didn't get interviews at 34 places I applied. 3) Running on 14 applications completely ignored. Not even a thanks for playing email. Nothing. And I just saw a reposting of a job for which I applied. That stings. 4) Send the application right back to them. You already spent the time, send it again and make them read it again. x3 5) Theresa, is that you? 6) Is that a Brexit joke? 7) May be. 8) Lol x6 9) Three interviews (1 on campus and 2 Zoom) out of 12 applications this year... I know I came out better than I anticipated, but hearing that the ""fit"" wasn't quite right, is almost worse than not being ""qualified"". Being a scientists and leaving my destiny to the fate of ""fit"" is a bit frustrating at times. 10) Dammit. Didn't get interviews at 52 places I applied (yes, really, 52). And my postdoc funding ends in just over 3 months, with nothing to move to after. Persistence pays off, I'm told, but it's hard to persist when things get desperate. 11) Dammit. Didn't get even a phone interview for 15 places I applied to. Got several K saved, looking like living in my car for another year - or teaching at a community college, honestly not sure which is worse, I shit you not.","negotiation 1) I am thrilled to have been offered a position at an R1. It's a great job; however, I am waiting on one other job for which I have just interviewed.  I was wondering if people have advice about (gently and tactfully) stalling negotiation?  2) It's common courtesy for schools to let you finish with pre-scheduled interviews.  But they may expect a decision soon after.   Get a final deadline and email the search chair at the other school to let them know what it is.  Ask if they can give you even an unofficial yes/no before that date.   It's hard to stall more than 4 weeks.  3) In my experience, I found requesting a skype date with the school that you have an offer from to be super helpful. This way you can discuss ""in person"" different things in the offer letter and start up negotiations. It also helps push back the date of things, because if they need to make changes to the offer letter based on your conversation then this sort of resets the clock. Not exactly sure if this would work in your situation, but it's really helped me in mine. 4) OP here -- thanks for the tips! ","Not sure if this belongs in venting but there isn’t a humor section.  I just got the following sentence in a rejection email after an in-person interview: “The committee determined that other candidates’ experience and education background more closely matched the duties of this position.”  Candidates plural?  The apostrophe would suggest the Chair meant candidates plural.  As in, you just want to let me know that everybody else you interviewed is so much better that you are withdrawing me from consideration.  Sorry, but I find this hilarious!  Probably because it’s true.  Wah-wah, joke’s on me.  Notice how I used the apostrophe correctly in two sentences.  2) I was sent a very similar rejection after an interview. They hired two out of three interviewees (not me). 3) Ouch 4) Given that you don't know how many candidates they interviewed, I wouldn't stress about it that much. Maybe they interviewed five and narrowed it down further and just wanted to let you know ASAP. 5) Getting a ""no"" is better than radio silence, although I know it isn't much comfort....5) I would assume that the plural was inentional considering that ""other"" was used and not ""another"". 6)  Initial poster is back: I got a phone call that confirmed it was a single person that got the job; the apostrophe was a mistake. Even if multiple people had gotten the job, seems common decency would not have you rub it in the unsuccessful person's face. 7) Sorry you had to go through it and I wish I could say this stuff wasn't common.","VAPs during COVID-19 I'm sort of surprised that several VAP searches seem to be going forward even amidst the pandemic (Oberlin, Pomona, Trinity). I'm near the end of a postdoc and some of these would normally sound pretty appealing, but are they really going to bring in a VAP to start in the fall when the decision comes down that all classes will be delivered online? How would that even work when you are moving across the country to a place where you aren't even allowed to go to your building or meet your colleagues in person? I can see for TT jobs where the timeline is a lot longer that you get through one or two awkward semesters expecting things to normalize eventually, but for these VAPS that would already be a large portion of the appointment and presumably these can't be deferred the way a TT job could be! I guess I'm glad they haven't cancelled the searches, but I can't really see how they will work.   2) To be fair, the Department probably also does not know how it will work because they don't know the status for fall yet either.  They just know that they have a gap that needs to be filled.  My guess is that they will be open to you working remotely from wherever. x3 3) Our VAP would teach courses that were already on the books. We mention in our ad that the pandemic necessitates flexibility in teaching mode. I suspect the new hire will move to the area, but depending on active Covid cases might be teaching remotely or to a limited group of students. "
"Administrator Intervention In light of the various job cancellations and what not, I'm curious as to how many searches have been either canceled or mucked with by administrators? Is this common? Do higher up admins (deans, vice provosts, even prez's) commonly decline (or intervene on) a SC's recommendation? If you have experience with this or know any stories I'd love to hear about it. A post doc in our lab recently got rejected after being told by the SCC that she was their top pick. Apparently, the higher ups disagreed and offered the position to someone else. 1) Are you sure that is was the ""higher-ups"", or could it be that the SCC is pretending that, to avoid future discomfort with the post-doc or with your adviser? 2) I had the same experience - SC said I was the annointed one, but the Dean seemed to differ

3) Often (usually?) the search committee is advisory to the department.  The SC's top pick may not be the department's. (4) I was overturned by the dean at Central Florida. 5) Last year I had two phone interviews with the department chair at a really tiny school (i.e. 4 people in the science department including the chair). She told me I was her top choice. I waited. Waited. Emailed her asking what the status of the search was and she said they hired someone else. Not that they were interviewing someone else, they had actually hired someone else. I don't know if I would have gotten a rejection if I hadn't inquired about the search. 6) Many departments the SC/department makes a recommendation to the dean, but ultimately can make another choice.","Monmouth U Been a month now. Anyone heard anything? Got contacted about setting up a phone interview in early April but scheduling that interview has been temporarily delayed, whatever that means. (2) Thanks and congrats. I never heard anything, so guess I'm out. (3) Check your ""junk"" email folder. For some reason my email contacting me for a phone interview was found there (2 weeks later). Luckily there was a delay in the schedule, so I wasn't affected. They plan to phone interview 8 and invite 3-4 on campus. (4) I have not been contacted either. To the poster who was contacted, just curious, what is your field of specialty? (5) global change Wetland ecosystem ecology",NA,NA,"Zero Information It is downright appalling the way that schools run their searches, and the total lack of of information and follow up for applicants. At this point, for more than half of the applications I have submitted, I have never received any reply at all. Even after the search has closed and the person has started their job. At one very prominent school in the midwest, I never received a rejection letter even after I was INTERVIEWED. Come on people. Have a little courtesy? 
agre. 2) Welcome to the world of academic job hunting.3) You assume that the search is about you and this is why you are upset. Once you accept the fact that's the process is not about you then you will feel better. 4) Thanks for the enlightenment #3!  You are wise, and I feel much better now. 5) Couldn't disagree more with #3.  The op never heard back after being interviewed!?!  6) I also interviewed at a school last year and never heard back. I understand not letting applicants know, but it's polite to contact interviewees. There's no such thing as common courtesy these days. 7) Had the same experience, an on-site followed by no contact. It comes across incredibly rude. 8) In my experience this is very common- it sucks, but many places will not follow up with people who have interviewed... OP: You'd think if they spent more than $1000 just getting me to their campus, and God knows how much more on the search itself, they could manage a simple email saying, ""we're no longer considering your application"". Eventually (after 3 months of silence) I broke down and called the Department Chair who was both extremely appologetic and livid that HR had not handled this. (9) agreed - unfortunately, this is standard practice. I think sometimes they wait until the person is at the school to let people know so they don't turn away people in case the one they hired ends up taking another job and not showing up (as strange as that sounds)!","Vandalism? Update: still messed up (1) The comments column of the vacancies tab is all scrambled. The comments don't match up to the jobs. I suspect vandalism but I don't know for sure. In any event, don't trust the comments column right now. (2) It's still all messed up as you get farther down the list. How did this happen?","F.  I'm tired of being bullied at my VAP job.  Started looking at alt-ac jobs (again) and can't find anything I'm not either over- or under-qualifed for despite a combined 13 years of schooling past HS.  I knew the market would suck, and I was prepared for that (as prepared as you can be), but I wasn't prepared to get into a somewhat reasonable VAP job and still have that suck. 2) Is there a reason why someone would accept a VAP position rather than a postdoc? 1 here again. I knew (thought?) I wanted to be at a slac so I had postdoc experience and when that ended, I moved into a VAP to get teaching experience in hopes that would give me an edge. Some have told me that's what SLACs really want, to know that you can actually teach...so I sought one of these out. 3) VAP positions are highly variable.  Some allow more freedom in research than a postdoc, and some do not allow research.  I think if you're interested in a SLAC job, teaching experience is important, and it's probably better to have one postdoc and one VAP position that two more more postdocs and little teaching experience. 4) definitely.  A lot of SLACs I looked at wouldn't consider someone without postdoc exp but preferred someone with teaching exp also. 5) I can't imagine the SLAC I work at hiring someone TT without teaching experience. 6). I think that the problem with being a VAP is that you're in Limbo, you aren't a postdoc, but you aren't faculty, yet you are acting just like one. So, it's hard to accept being low (wo)man on the totem pole. You get the scraps, always, and it's pretty hard to find time to publish given that it's always a new prep each semester. But I think that after you are 5-6 years out as a post-doc,that it's a necessary evil. You aren't going to get hired without the actual classroom experience.","Chalk talks Do you suggest doing negotiations by email or by phone?  I've been seeing a number of people (especially in response to W's try at negotiations with Nazareth) that negotiations should be done over the phone.  However, it was made quite clear to me at my last job that ""it does not matter what they say to you, it only matters what is written down."" 
2) I just went through this - the Dean went over the initial offer with me over the phone, explaining what everything was while I took notes.  He then sent an itemized summary of what we talked about (1. salary 2. start up 3. tenure  4. office/lab 5. teaching duties 6. travel 7. moving expenses etc., it was a long phone call).  I then thought about it over the weekend.  We spoke about it again on Monday and I said what I would like vs. what he offered.  He wrote it all down.  He then called me back a few days later with an amended offer.  I agreed.  Then he took everything to the President and now I am waiting on the contract.  
3) Similar experience to #2. Dean called with the offer, then sent a detailed email outlining everything we talked about.  Then the rest happened over email -- I countered, then he countered.  He then called to make sure everything looked good before he sent me the official offer. 
4) very similar experience here too. I always made sure to have everything in writing before going for the next step. Leaving a paper trail gives you something in hand. But in between phone calls and other communication is also vital to keep the ball rolling. 5) My first job I got everything told to me on the phone, then sent to me in the email, then none of it transpired, and I discovered that (at the time) email was not binding in the state where I was working.  SOOOOOO, get it in a letter. ",Bet you'll get a job anyway! :) [Nope. End of second year of searching and realizing I am financially incapacitated and not going to get an academic job. But your optimism was kind],"All spreadsheet cells are locked down Hi all -- as of 4:16pm EDT on 11/30/15, all of the cells in the ""Faculty Jobs"" tab are locked down and prevent editing, including columns G-I that are supposed to be fully editable. Is everyone else having the same problem? 2) No, it works for me. 3) #1 here: Update: I tried a different browser besides Chrome and the problem went away. I supposed clearing the cache in Chrome may also have worked. 4) I've noticed they all become locked when I'm in a filter view, and so if it was reopened, it may have reset it to no filter? This setting can be changed under Data --> Filter Views 5) The filter views thing doesn't entirely work. For instance there is a job with an update of 11/3015 that does not get sorted properly 6) Should be fixed","Even if I ever get a job (which is looking increasingly unlikely at this point), I don't know how I can ever look students in the eyes and tell them they should do research. Why encourage a passion for something that has led to far more broken dreams (and broken homes in many cases) than successes? 2) Tell them the truth. Secure, senior jobs in environmental research and in academia are very rewarding, but only a small fraction of PhDs will get them, However, a PhD is also a great asset if they are looking for a career as a consultant or in government environmental management or policy, and those are more likely paths. 3) Industry also has its merits - having been a postdoc in Europe, where the PhD glut is most severe,  I noted that most of the PhDs ended up in industry or in other professions, not academia.  It's not a stretch to say that grad school can give experiences that can be leveraged toward other professions.  4) Don't go telling students a PhD is a good ticket to a government job - that's often a tougher road than academia. You have to try to jump in midstream against employees already in the system. The only way to get a job with a government agency is if you have already worked with them closely - they don't select on the basis of merit, but on personal connections. 5) Yes, in my experience the advise of 2 & 3 is hogwash meant to make those in academia feel better about over producing students who will have a hard time getting the jobs they are trained for. People who I know that have made those transitions have often had a really hard time just getting into entry level jobs after spending 6+ years getting an advanced degree. While some basic research skills, etc, do transfer, those are not the jobs that a PhD in basic biology train you for (not that they aren't good jobs, but it just doesn't make sense to promote as a 'good option'). A masters and personal connections/internships, etc is a better way to get there. Of course some specific PhD programs (e.g. working closely with govt agencies, more policy based, etc) are more amenable to this approach (or biomed research for a transition to industry), but this is not a general solution. 6) Dear #5,  I was talking about Europe and as a possible model for what is happening in the US. With most faculty positions, there is intense pressures to produce students ('productivity'). Saying the economy can't support your work is recipe of tenure denial or failure to get merit raises or worse (guess who leaves when your university declares financial exigency).  Some places also value where your students end up going, points earned for a relevant job, points lost if your students are unemployed. Students who specialized in genomics/bioinformatics end up with decent chances at getting jobs in industry, agriculture or other applied areas.  If people aren't very good at getting a job in academia or industry, maybe the problem is with advising. Nobody said life is easy - success requires planning. If someone ends up becoming a specialist of some aspect of evolutionary theory, they should not try to get a job at Life Technologies.  As an aside, it's interesting to note that even though we study the dynamics of ecological and evolutionary systems, I don't think as a group EEB people are a very dynamic when it comes to the job market.  Science is changing, people. 7) 5 again. I agree with everything you say here 6. I have just seen a lot of PIs with specializations that don't have direct non-academic pipelines repeat these options without really thinking about how their students are actually going to get jobs. I think that most genuinely want the best for their students, but they don't realize how valid the concerns that the OP raises here are and this is a convenient way to validate their positions. 8) I'm #2. #5, I don't know about PhDs in basic biology. My experience is with PhDs in environmental engineering and marine science. I know heaps of people who have gone from PhDs in these fields straight into govt or consulting -- certainly more than I know who have continued in academia. Their PhDs are counted as experience, so they usually (not always) skip the entry-level positions. And once there, they quickly pull ahead of colleagues without PhDs. Most of them were working on applied problems during their PhDs, on topics very relevant to government agencies. Of my PhD cohort, 1 is a tenured academic, 1 is tenure-track, 1 is a long-term postdoc, 4 went straight into consulting, 2 have secure national lab research positions, 1 went straight into industry, 1 straight into government policy, 1 is now a home-maker. 9) My experience aligns closely with 4 + 5, and I work very closely with govt folks in US. It is best thought of as a completely different career track, but most in the academy tend to view it as a fallback or compromise, which is an unfortunate mistake. 10) I agree government should be treated as a different career track, not a fallback, but it's still a career-track in which a PhD helps a lot -- at least, in my part of the world: is it different in the US? 11) I think there are some jobs in US or other government work where a PhD helps (scientist), but others where it can be a major hinderance (policy and management). My sense is that there can be a percpetion when competing for jobs that candidate x does not really want to do this job, they are more interested in science and would not be happy long-term doing e.g., policy work or staff management/leadership. Hence I agree with some others here that if an agency job is what a scientist desires, they might consider veering from the traditional academic training mode/expectations. In other words, make visible the desire to do that type of work. Perhaps that high impact evol paper might not be as a useful as one that pushes conservation policy forward in a tangible way, likely in collab with agency peps. Or a project that has a major outreach component. Relationship building and communication skill development is key. The advisor matters alot too as their style will dicatate research questions and openness to an applied context. I think not disimilar from the different skill sets cultivated for SLAC jobs (teaching), just wider variability in how exactly to accomplish that.","fewer jobs than last year? I only applied for 3 jobs this year, didn't see as many as I thought I would.  Is this true for anyone else? Are people using other job sites? 2) I only saw 4 jobs that were a good disciplinary fit and at my level, but I applied for 12 jobs anyway. Got interviews for two that I thought were good fits and one that was a stretch. Only half the jobs I applied for were jobs I found here: the rest were on academic job advertising sites. 3) seems about the same as last year... 4) Hope ya posted those jobs you didn't find here @2! 5) Of course! 6) I just  perused the long list of jobs (there are 2 wikis being used fyi).  It is shocking how many of last year's jobs are re-posted this year.  Last year had a lot of vacancies.  THis year seems to be a good chunk of repeats from last year.  7) @6 A lot of failed searches? 8) Where is the other wiki #6? x4","Ugh! Just learned that my dept. is going through with a nepotistic hire of an unqualified candidate. No independent research. By all accounts, a bad teacher, and we're offering over 200k in startup. Multiple faculty ranked them unacceptable!  This process is irreparably broken. 2) Is it a spousal hire, by any chance? During my PhD my department did a pressure hire of a mediocre AT BEST person because they were married to a BIG name in another department. 3) Spousal hires are the norms nowadays. Usually spouses could be at a different stage of their career but to attract the main spouse, universities have to offer the other spouse a position too. 4)OP here. Not a spousal hire. Graduate of the dept.  5) Have they done the faculty vote after the committee vote? Has the dean approved?  There still could be a couple of steps to override.  With an internal or COI hire this sometimes can happen.  I know one school where the dean comes back with questions about the top 2 candidates and asks for justification.  It depends on how involved your admins are. Sorry to say though that this happens often.  If there were more jobs for everyone, it wouldn't seem so soul crushing. 6) I think I've heard of this happening a lot at certain places. Is your dept somewhere in Mississippi by chance? 7) Do you work in the White House?  8) @3, Spousal hires are definitely not the norm.  They're increasingly rare. 9) I was a nepotistic hire (not spousal hire), but the President of the University would not allow my department to intverview me. Even though I had a $200K/2yr continuous grant with a letter from the funding agency saying they supported me continuing it (the grant has since been canceled), excellent teaching evals (>4.5/5 while I was a VAP there post PhD), current undergrads doing research with me, on multiple MS committees, 15 publications, and support from all faculty in the department...But I now think it was for the best. Although I'm in post-doc mode and this application season has not yielded one phone interview :(  10) OP, what do you mean by ""no independent research""? can you elaborate a little? seriously no publications, or just all publications having multiple authors? one could argue that a pub with multiple authors is not independent research, but then there are very few researchers who truly do it alone 11) OP here, @10, no post-Phd research; @6, nope, not in the southeast; @7, thanks for the smile and the perspective!, and @9, that sucks, I think you should have been interviewed anyway, at least the phone/skype round, it would have been kind to give you the practice. The juxtoposition between your situation and this one (qualified vs. not )is exactly why I get so worked up about the broken system! 9 here, @OP, i feel the same way as you and why I wanted to provide the other end of it. It is such a broken system. It makes it hard to navigate the job search when you really never know what the search committee wants or even if you have no chance from the beginning and could be wasting your time. 13) I wouldn't call someone a dud though. Some folks do better than others in their careers. 12) Thanks for pointing that out. I apologize - wrong choice of words. I've changed it. 14) @12, I think calling it ""nepotism"" is worse; spousal accomodations are clearly not nepotism (that would be if the spouse themselves are hiring a spouse/relative), and without them, a lot of highly talented people would need to leave academia because of the job search limitations that come with having dual academic careers. I'd also consider that who you called a dud, may have been a great fit for an open search position in a different department at a different university with a different focus. 12) Excellent points all around. deleted. 15) @12, I agree with you that it doesn't really make much sense to call this kind of hiring nepotism, but that is how the word is pretty commonly used in academic searches (for whatever reason). Partner hires in some places are actually covered by 'anti-nepotism laws'. ","Odd interview vibe Is it normal for interviews to use a script and not have follow up questions? I just had an interview (my second ever) and it was weird. I stopped to allow follow-up questions but got nothing and the scripted questions were sometimes things that didn't quiet apply to me the way they were phrased. For example, they asked how I would include undergraduates in my research but I already teach at a PUI so I already do that and its in my CV and cover-letter so why waste interview time on this instead of a more specific question: ""Tell me about how your current project involves undergraduate students?"". Anyone else had a similar experience? Does this mean that they already have the candidate and are going thru the motions or is this a common strategy to make us talk (in which case I sucked!)... 2) I've heard search committees say they're legally obligated to ask everyone the same questions so that the interview process if fair. x4 3) I had a weird one like that during the skype interview, but I think it was just a mechanism for everyone who interviews to be treated equally. The on-campus was a lot more normal. x2 4) both skype interviews I've had did this and it was very awkward. 5) I've found this common with Canadian search committees—they want to ask the same questions to all the candidates, so they are scripted. It was usually prefaced with ""we know this is a bit more awkward and scripted, but here is why we are doing it this way"". They also allowed for a small amount of follow-up, so your experience sounds a bit odd, but I wouldn't read too much into it. 6) most universities (R1s anyway) have hiring guidelines which either suggest or require that phone/video interviews are scripted with the exact same questions to each candidate x3 7) I've had scripted interviews with no follow up questions allowed for both phone/skype and on campus interviews (1 hour with the search committee in the on campus ones). In most cases they told me ahead of time that they were not allowed to deviate from the script per HR regulations and seemed apologetic about that fact, so I wouldn't read anything into it in terms of other potential candidates, etc. X2 8) OP here, thanks for the info. Make sense. I wish I knew because it really made me feel weirded out and unprepared. I know now for next time! 9) For phone interviews we have to have our list of questions approved by HR ahead of time. We can ask those questions and only those questions. We usually like to add one final question that gives candidates an oppurtunity to separate themselves: ""Is there anything else you would like to tell us about yourself that was not covered in the previous questions?""  X2 10) Yep, I have been involved in different types of searches at 4 institutions.  All (for phone interviews) have an approved (by HR) script of questions that are identical for all candidates.  Follow-up is only allowed if something is missed or the interviewee asks for clarification.  Based on my experience, this is pretty common.","I got a phone interview for a TT job last winter and didn't get the job. This fall, I can see on the department's page who got the job. I thought to myself: oh, they didn't like me because I am saltwater and they seem (from the interview questions) more interested in a field biologist doing freshwater work. Guess what? The guy who got it is a shark person :( so much for that. He is also a field biologist that does some lab work too. He also has like 2x my publication record, is 3 years younger (from graduation date) etc. Well... Just wanted to vent out... It really brought me a bit down... :( 2) Bummer. He may be 3 years younger, but you're probably 3x cooler! 3) Hiring is such a weird fucking thing. Don't let it get you down! 4) All us rejects should invest in some bitcoin and then go start our own research institute somewhere. What could go wrong? 5) Fuck it. This profession and job hunt is crushing, but your worth isn't tied to your job, or number of pubs, or any bullshit metric that these fuckers can demand because it's a ""buyer's"" market. You're probably a really awesome person and deserve a lot better than this profession has to give. Sincerely, the Universe. x4 6) #1 here, thanks specially to #5, I need a bit of possitive reaffirmation... I have compiled a growing list of about 40 places that I am going to apply this year. I hope to at least get some interviews this year... That would be nice! 7) My experience is that the further you get in a job search, the less it has to do with you...that is, you have to be awesome and be a decent fit on paper to get a first-round interview, but beyond that, the idiosyncracies of the search needs and of the personalities of the search committee become really important...and, nothing you can do about that! 8) Don't sweat it, other kinds of career setbacks will come for him sooner or later, this just wasn't one of them. 9) OP here, LOL thnks! But seriously, I don't wish anything bad on him. However, a part of me is glad I didn't get the job. The school seems like it wants to be more than what it is...

I would have guessed an effect in that direction, based on anecdotes, but 50%-60% difference in number of interviews and the  differences in representation at the tail of the distribution of interview number are pretty extreme  3) Really, 85% of applicants got an on-campus interview? Seems like the sample is probably pretty skewed toward the successful-- why brag about our failures? x2 4) Fox attempts to assess how reliable the data are by comparing the % of each population self-reporting in the Anon Quals here with other more robust estimates of % of each population reported elsewhere. The things that's missing is an interaction between gender and probability of self-reporting. For example, if men were more likely to self-report anon quals when they're not successful, and women were more likely to self-report anon quals when they are successful, that could produce the observed results (including the cross-walk under ""EEB faculty job seekers as a group""). There is lots of good research demonstrating that such an interaction between confidence/gender exists, and that interaction is a primary limitation of the analysis. Yes, there's more robust evidence available that more women are being hired to EEB positions recently (and that's, to me, good news); I'm not sure this analysis adds anything to that fact. 5) Some interesting earlier comments on this post were deleted! 6) I agree with 3, seems like the people most likely to under-report are people who submit relatively few applications and don't end up with any interviews. 7) I never had the impression that a high % of ecoevojobs lurkers were filling out anon quals. I never filled it out, and only 93 people this year, while there are >750 jobs (many of which may go to candidates who don't use ecoevojobs, but point stands). 8) Jeremy Fox from Dynamic Ecology here. @6: I just updated the linked post with some additional analyses checking for and correcting the likely reporting bias you identified: people who report applying to few positions do indeed tend not to report how many interviews and offers they received. Probably, many received no interviews or offers, since after all they applied to few positions. Correcting for that likely reporting bias by assuming that all non-reports of # of interviews and # of offers since 2015-16 are actually zeroes doesn't change the results *that* much, because there aren't *that* many nonreports. But it was a good thing to check; thank you. 9) The levelling off in interviews with > 30 applications is interesting, and I agree it's probably driven by limits to the # of jobs that can be a good fit in any given year. But I'm not sure, just based on my own experiences, that it doesn't still make sense to apply to as many jobs as possible that you would be willing to accept. Applying really broadly is like testing the market and getting feedback about where you are competitive, because it's not always obvious. For example, I have a lot of teaching experience and love teaching, so I applied to lots of SLACs and PUIs, but virtually all of my interviews came from R1s and R2s, which I interpret as the result of having had a research intensive postdoc. But before the job season, I would have guessed that I would be more successful at SLACs than at R1s. Similarly, I got an offer at a place that I almost didn't apply to because the topic was quite different from my research focus. So it's really hard to anticipate what a good fit really means in advance (as others have said), and I still think the shotgun approach is ultimately the best strategy. 10) I kind of agree with #9.  I have a solid but not exceptional publication record, but a more extensive teaching record (multiple courses as instructor of record, and a teaching award).  I would have expected prior to this cycle that I'd do better in competition for teaching-based positions than research ones.  But my applications have generally done better at research universities than at liberal arts schools, and I didn't even make it to a phone interview at any SLAC.  Particularly for people whose work straddles a couple of disciplinary boundaries, it's not always clear from just the ad whether you'd be a good fit for what they're looking for, so there can be a real advantage in applying pretty broadly.  ","Now rejected from all applications except the one with my best campus interview ever. They are still interviewing my competitors. Funding ends this year. No pressure!!! 2) Sometimes it is the push you need to get out of academics and make some money. 3) Best of luck, happened to me and I got it, YMMV 4) Are you me? :) @4 well after applying to 40 positions in the last few months it is possible that I lost my mind and responded to my own message, but I am pretty sure you aren't me haha, BUT congrats to you! ;)","Quitting your current position 1) Just took a TT job that is an excellent fit for me, however I still have not officially left my current position (a non TT long term gig) becuase I am still a little paranoid that things could fall through. I have the offer signed and returned and have been getting everything signed with HR (a little slow becuase of the current public health emergency). I should be good to go right?  2) Hard to say.  Nothing is final until it's final.  And considering everything that's going on, I wouldn't consider it to be final even if it is final.  At a minimum, it sounds like your new university is continuing the process, so if there's going to be a freeze that cuts you out, it's not official yet.  However, be aware that **everything can change**.  Announcements about Fall being online or not are likely to be made by June.  My guess is that most universities will be online.  Enrollments are probably going to tank, which means revenue is probably going to tank.  Then everything will be up in the air.  My prediction anyway. 3) Yes, hold on to your current job for as long as you can. No need to rush and tell your current employer. Think about yourself and play your cards wisely. 4) do you think the AAUP guideline of telling the current employer I am leaving by May 15th is still good?  5) Any good advisor will try to keep you if something falls through.  Make sure they know your situaton but don't sign resignation papers until you have to. 5) I am in the EXACT same position. My new institution has already instituted a hiring freeze, but has assured me my position is safe as I was hired before that, but I agree with 2 that ""nothing is final until it's final"" and it's hard not to feel nervous...6) same position as you. I feel secure in my position, but will wait until mid or late June to move (when presumably the next fiscal year's budget is as set as possible), and will communicate with dept. head before making the move just to be as sure as possible. Hope for the best, plan for the worst :) 7) I think its hard to find the balance between own self interests and not trying to hurt your current institution with telling them so late in the summer. 8) Think about yourself first. Remember, the administration at your current institution would drop you in a heartbeat and not even blink an eye at the personal financial strains it would put on your family. Forget about ""AAUP guidelines"" - they were not written with pandemics in mind.  Maybe speak with your chair so he/she can prepare if you feel it would be in confidence. x3 9) No institution that is using non-TT positions to fill their needs deserves for you to be thinking about their needs.  They have not committed to you, you do NOT need to commit to them. X 4"
"Pitiful! I figured out why none of us have jobs- we are idiots OR we are so paranoid of one another it debilitates us. I've been drooling over this wiki for months on the UNH positions and just found on their website that they are having on-site interviews... but no one reported this- who/why/wtf? check it:https://calendar.unh.edu/MasterCalendar.aspx . We suck- you suck.. ugh. 1) How would not posting something here influence your ability to get a job? 
2) Real reason why none of us have jobs: Number of highly qualified candidates >> Number of jobs. QED 
(3) So there are 339 entries on the vacancies page - some have been officially canceled but others offer more than one position. Plus, there have been a number of jobs that never made it on the Wiki in the first place. How is it that so many of us still don't have interviews, let alone offers? How many applicants are really out there? Only ~94 on the 'comp' page - obviously not every seeker is on there - but so (seemingly) few offers. 
(4) There must be many searchers who are not on the wiki, and still more who use the wiki but did not fill out a line on the Anon Qual page. Which probably explains why many jobs do not get updated (including, likely, UNH). I would guess that there are at least 200 (and maybe 300) people searching for jobs in Ecology and Evolution. (The jobs with >300 applicants tend to be for general biology or multiple positions.) The seriousness of their search will vary wildly, from dropping one application on a whim to desperately applying to anything remotely close in order to avoid unemployment. The numbers might seem to indicate that everyone will get a job, but many searches fail to hire anyone, and some of the 339 jobs listed will not hire an Ecologist or Evolutionary Biologist. 
(5) I think you guys are forgetting the fact that E&E is a general term covering a very broad field. I for one can only find <30 position openings each year with descriptions that fit my expertise (and that's really pushing it with some). Many SC's seem to have rather specific candidate specialty in mind, even though the job description might sound more general. Consequently, the functional job market is much smaller than it appears. I'd like to meet someone who was actaully able to apply to all 339 jobs. 
(6) #4, I think you've got it right, though I'd suggest that 300 applicants might still be an underestimate. Failed searches are a big problem, especially when the hiring process is so slow-moving to begin with. Most of us are hoping for TT jobs at RU institutions - if there really are (which seems likely) so many qualified applicants for any given job, does anyone see a moral problem with accepting a TT job and training future PhD ecologists who have very little chance of getting a PhD-level job? 
(7) #2/4 again. #5, I completely agree. I applied to as many jobs as I possibly could, and did not even come close to 339. Out of those, about 10 were a reasonably good fit discipline- and institution-wise, and maybe 2 of those seemed ideal. #6, I see your point as well, although I'd argue that most of us knew what we were getting into when we started. Before I entered graduate school, a professor warned me, ""There are no jobs."" I soldiered on regardless, with the (over?)confidence that I would be able to succeed. I still think things are going to turn out okay for me and for the rest of us, because this year's job market is just downright horrible. It may suck this bad for a long time, but I hope not.
8) I too see your point #6. There are some issues with training/producing future biologists knowing that the odds of landing a satisfactory TT job are stacked against them. But, I think the root of these issues is funding and, a lack of funding ultimately results from a lack of interest/support from legislators (stemming from a lack of interest/support from the public). It's a big mess and everyone here has an opinion on the matter(s).
(9) #2/4/7 again: By the way, it looks like nearly 100 jobs on the wiki were either accepted or offered and not yet declined. Some people are getting jobs! The bad news is we may still have to compete with these people again next year. At at least one of the jobs I interviewed for, I was beat out by a first-year assistant professor. And #8, I agree. This year we have had a double funding whammy: the accumulating effects of 8 years of lack of interest by the government, followed by an economic downturn that walloped the states and prevented a newly elected pro-science administration from doing anything lasting about the funding situation. 
(10) #6 again. The way I see it, there will never be enough funding for everyone so there will always be resource limitation, but limited 'habitat' (positions) is the bigger problem. I'd suggest that we've overshot - or are coming very close to overshooting - our K as ecology specialists. And just to set the record straight, the NSF budget (3.9-6.1B), as well as the allocation for research (3.0-4.8B), grew by ~55% from 2000-2008. Not sure how BIO specifically did, though. 
(11) The NSF budget is pathetic compared to the NIH one ($30 billion). They allocate $16 billion to research grants alone. Of course, both agencies' budgets cringe in the face of that of the Dept. of Defense.
12) But, does federal money (both NIH and NSF) fund TT faculty positions? <= ignorance, not sarcasm. I'm not arguing that the NSF budget is sufficient; it is pathetic. But does an increase in funding directly increase the # of TT positions in EEB programs? 
13) Federal money brings in overhead, which keeps departments running. But whether departments can hire depends on a lot of factors, both economic and political. New faculty require a large upfront investment and space in a building, bot of which are often in short supply. 
(14) #6/10 again. I'm not trying to start trouble (honest!) - I've just been thinking about long-term trends and prospects for professional ecologists now that I'm facing challenges and realities of such a career choice. Funding for ecology is far rarer than funding for biomed/DOD, etc. and we're not likely to see this trend change (for the better) in our lifetimes. At some point - and maybe we're there - the supply of highly trained ecologists will far surpass the demand, or at least support infrastructure, for them. I had not really thought about this before now (naive me...) and I'm thinking about how I would/will advise future students. I've concluded, at minimum, that I'll make students aware of the job picture and strongly encourage them to develop skills that are applicable to more than just ecology (cell/molecular work, GIS, math/stats, etc.). I appreciate others' opinions and the general civility of the discourse so far, especially given the contentious nature of the topic. thanks - I look forward to hearing what others have to say... 
(15) You suck, 6/10/14!!!!! Just kidding...I didn't want people to see the continued civility and think they were on the wrong wiki ;) I have to agree with you about prodding my future students to diversify their skill sets. Especially since I am as ""single-skilled"" as it gets and regretting every minute of my past laziness at learning skills that didn't seem useful at the time. Sort of a ""Do as I say, not as I do."" situation. 
(16) I guess I am doing something about the problem by failing to get a job, thus avoiding training any future PhDs who will also fail to get jobs. 
(17) Good one, 16.  It would be funnier if it weren't true.  I think that's a solution that too many of us are going to use this year.","Looking forward To those of you who got campus interviews this year at RU/H - RU/VH institutions, based on your interactions with SC members, what do you think got you the interview(s)? Number or quality of publications? Grants received? Academic pedigree? Or was it just the nebulous ""fit"" and you got lucky? Obviously these are all important, but which seemed MOST important? 1) Yes, all of the above (2) Not helpful. Based on your interactions, do you think any had greater weight in their decision? (3) pedigree didn't matter in my case (4) I'm guessing quality of pubs and pedigree. (5) One - the job description was fairly narrow and fit like a glove.  Plus I knew someone one campus who asked my to apply.  Two - good phone interview.  I was told multiple times that they were really impressed with my answers - partially I think because I had put a lot of time into getting familiar with the faculty/interests.  Partially also luck that honest answers on a few questions matched their expectations.  I am sure good publications (although not an absurd number) helped.  One of the committee members also did his PhD at my PhD institution, so that was a good connection. (6) I honestly don't know. I had met three of the SC chairs before, but only briefly. Connections to my PhD institution were common, but I went to a big program. The only specific thing I was told was that my letters helped. My guess is that the most important thing is having good pubs and being able to weave those into a coherent story (in the cover letter and research statement). Of course, none of that helped me get a job.",NA,NA,"sex with self at interview I had sex with myself in my hotel room during an interview last year.  It was pretty awesome, but we're both married, so I'm not sure what to do... 1) well, it is done, so try to forget about it.

The worst part is that we keep running into each other, like, ALL THE TIME.  It's really awkward. 4) I feel for you, OP. I do this all the time, and have to bear the shame when I run into myself.

It does not appear to generally be a problem. 8) I had a great Skype interview recently. I did not hide that I was looking at my notes throughout the interview and was writing down stuff they were saying (this wasn't constant but I was doing it). It didn't seem to be a problem at all. 9) To be honest, I like Skype interviews just fine. Each time I've had one, I've been invited to campus.","classes named in contract? I am applying for a job at a university where I worked before as a VAP.  The chair (of the dept, not on the SC) has written refernces for me at other universities.  Some people told me that [BECAUSE so many jobs hires today are based on who you know], in addition to the application package, I should contact the chair of the search committe via email and tell them... I guess more of why I am so interested/or maybe just a reminder that we hung out. Is this something you would suggest?  If so, what would I say? 2) I do not think that it hurts to let your colleague know that you have applied- you are looking for anything that will help your application stand out. In the past, I have handled this type of situation by emailing the person that I know with a sort of question that any candidate might ask- Do they think that I am a good fit for the job? Should I apply? I generally get a generic response, but then at least you know that they are aware that you have applied for the job. My impression is that I have had more success in getting phone or on-campus interviews from institutions where I have primary or secondary connections, so this can be one of many factors that can help you get to the next level. OP) Thanks!  I have been keeping my reference/the dept chair up to date on phone interviews/etc. at other places I've applied to.  Now I feel nervous about letting them know, since ... what if the chair tells the SC and they assume I'll get a job elsewhere and not pursue me.  Do I stop updating my reference? 2 again) I do not think that it hurts to keep your reference updated- demonstrating that you are desirable to multiple institutions should make you more competitive. I have applied a similar sort of logic by letting search committees know about other interviews or offers that I have had.

It's alredy mid-March, so we're getting closer and closer to August of 2017, when most of us would start our new positions?  Can we expect more job postings or will be mostly see temp and adjunct gigs until August now?  Where is everyone in the process?  I've got about 5-6 apps out and have not gotten official rejections from any, had one phone interview, and another phone interview next week, but haven't heard a peep from the other ones I applied to.  I've been looking for a new gig for 4-5 years so far and just can't seem to pull it off.  There are days where I get super depressed about it, but then realize that doesn't do anyone any good and pull myself up, submit more grant proposals and manuscripts, and just keep on keeping on assuming that eventually my new job will find me.  Think positive as hard as it is!  Good luck to those that have gotten offers so far this job season and don't give up to those that haven't! 2) Unfortunately, I believe this job season is over. A few tt positions will pop up here and now and be inundated with 100s of desperate applications. Here's to next year....3) Thanks for this OP -- nice to know others are going through the same cycles of anxiety/depression/resilience x2 4) To 3), why is it nice to know that other people are suffering too? It shouldn't be this way. 5) too many phds nowadays...we should all become career counselors against grad school. Or we all suck in comparison to the competition and should give up on life. Plumbing does make well! 6) Too many Phds but also universities expect to make money from it's faculty, so they are bound to be fairly choosy.  7) I'd say the job season is about over- I have a few more apps to send out, but I would doubt we'll get more than a handful of new ads.  Also, plenty of anxiety/frustration here.  Apparently, I can get interviews, but I get no offer every time 8) I empathise with the ""interviews but no offer"" situation. Is it that we are crap at interviews, or is it that we are getting interviews so they can tick a diversity box, but have next to no real chance? 9) I honestly think that alot of people are crap at interviews. Not sure if it is anxiety or just the academic crazies, but I've seen more than several outstanding candidates blow the on-campus interview.   10) If the positions are going to senior hires, it's prob the system.  Maybe same if one candidate snags 10 jobs at the same schools. If they always go to different jr hires, you may need to do practice talks and play up your enthusiasm.

","What happens after first candidate declines offer? Just curious what usually happens after a candidate declines an offer. Does the search committee need to meet again? Does an offer to the second candidate need to be approved by the administration?  Was all of this already worked out so another offer can be made to the next candidate immediately? 2) I think it depends on the institution/department. From the systems I'm most familiar with, the search committee provides the department head with a ranked list of acceptable candidates after the interviews. If the dept. head and dean agree with the top candidate an offer is made. If it is declined, the dept. head and dean then consider the second choice and whether and offer is warranted, and so on... 3) definitely varies department by department.  Also note that admins have the final say in terms of who (if anyone) gets an offer so someone ranked #1 by the department still may not get the job. 4) What sort of timeline might be involved after the first candidate rejects the offer? A week, two, before the second candidate gets an offer? @4, I think that's probably a typical timeline (although it varies of course) for after the first offer is declined. The more lengthy process is usually the negotiation of the first offer and the time for the candidate to think about it before rejecting. OP) Thanks all!","That moment when you accidentally look up your past colleague (the one you thought would never land a faculty position anywhere for a variety of reasons), and find out that the person just joined an R1 on a tenure track position while you still remain as a postdoc (after close to 10 years out Ph.D), and realize all your peers, and even several juniors are now faculties. :(     2) I know it's hard but try not to play the comparison game.  There are so many factors in the job market.  Some are about publications and grants.  A lot of them are not related to merit at all. Try to focus on getting good work done and keep plugging.  The real secret to getting a job is often persistance. 3) I completely agree with 2. Shortly after grad school, I did play the comparison game and it hurt. But now, I realize everyone is on their own path and we all have different circumstances. There are definitely past colleagues I have that are well qualified and would be amazing TT candidates but they don't have a TT position for one reason or another. 4) How's that work when you see that a very recent faculty hire who just completed his Ph.D in 2018, but was in f**ing High School when you were awarded a Ph.D? Phrases like ""we all have different circumstances"", and ""everyone is on their own path"" are really nice words, but will those suffice to give any solace? 5) @4, maybe the universe is telling you you;re on the wrong path? 6) @5: LOL. Are you really saying that a fresh graduate is better than someone with several years of experience & accomplishments? 7) I didn't read that in 4's comment at all. 8) https://rowman.com/ISBN/9781538103418/The-Meritocracy-Myth-Fourth-Edition 8) What #4 mean (I am guessing) and what I felt when I was on the tenure track was, that people who started later than you but got faculty positions while you are still a postdoc and how do one feel about that? It is hard not to play the comparison game. What if that person has less publications than you? How do you feel when an undergraduate you have mentored is now a tenure track faculty member while you are still a postdoc? Is it time to give up yet? It is hard not to look at the people around and not compare and not feel anything...x2","Reasons for turning down an offer I've been noticing a decent amount of people who have turned down offers and waited it out a year or more for something better to come along. Besides situations where you and a partner are geographically separated, what are some other reasons people have for turning down a job? It's always just surprising when I hear about it happening, given what a shitty time I'm having even getting a single offer. 2) I am currently negotiating an offer.  The budget is *tiny*, to the point where I am questioning whether it's possible to buy the equipment I would need to produce science I want to do (and pitched to them to get the offer).  Seriously, an extra $20k in the startup would make this so much more plausible, but here I'm debating how risky it is to buy refurbished crucial equipment from eBay with no warranty because they can't give me the money to buy an incubator and a freezer.  I'm leaning towards taking it anyway because there's no guarantee I'd get an offer next year if I keep in my postdoc, but....I can see why someone might not be willing to pull the trigger in this kind of situation. 3) I was interviewed by a dean who made it clear to me that evolution and religion were contentious topics at that school. When they lowballed me on salary and refused to negotiate on either salary or startup, it was a pretty easy decision. The second school I turned down advertised for a specialist, then quickly turned the position into 75%+ A&P teaching. Their salary was also low and they requested an active research program, for which they gave $0 in defined startup. Also an easy turn down. Both searches ultimately failed (or at least returned to the pool), so I wasn't the only one to think so  4) I turned down an R1 TT offer when the department seemed to have so many issues I was worried I would not be able to do my work.  The Dept head was trying to shaft all the candidates at the negotiation, possibly to fail the search on purpose.  A faculty member told me not to show up because I would not fit in without kids; multiple faculty asked about my marital status and kids with respect to the choice of hire.  Faculty bad mouthed one another to an unreasonable degree.  Faculty insulted minority and first gen students.  The dept head insulted me in his office more than once when I met with him, on everything to choice in classical music to research skills.  The dept was fighiting with the dean and she was witholding resources, and they said faculty were trying to reduce grad stipends to balance the budget without losing faculty dedicated resources.   The dept has since had a wave of people leaving.  The whole place seemed like it was dysfunctional and the prospect of trying to get research done in that scenario seemed terrifying.  It looked more likely to tank my career in a way that might be difficult to recover from.  Every candidate on that search turned it down, and 3 of us had no other offers.  I'm not friends with the other 2 candidates so I don't know their status. 5) I think I might have interviewed at the same school 6) I interviewed for a place in which the position was not tenure-track because the provost told me during my interview that they wouldn't want to keep anyone whose research was ""unmarketable."" (Who has the right to make that decision?) There was an expectation in the job announcement that the position would include research with undergraduates, but one of the lab instructors (not on the SC) told me that faculty don't really get to do research. Every person had a different story about what research space was available for me to use. So, I needed to do research, would be a held to a TT standard, but wouldn''t be given any resources to complete the research. There was also very obvious tension between several of the faculty/staff, and the first-year faculty all looked like deer in the headlights. 7) I turned down an offer at a west coast school because the cost of living was so high. They offered a salary about 20k above national average for a large masters university but when median home price is a million dollars, even a salary close to six figures won't cut it. Plus there was a high teaching load with an expectation to maintain teachiing productivity. I still had a year left on my post-doc (which is a great group and project) so I figured I would try again this year. I put in 50+ applications this year, 3 on-campus invites and finally an offer a few weeks ago at a place I love. It worked out but the stress of this job season has caused me to lose whatever little hair I had left and gain 10 lbs, completely my transition to a dad-bodied, stressed out, junior faculty. 8) I had a very similar experience as #7, got an offer early in my postdoc at a good masters-level university, but just couldn't live in the area on their salary range, so I turned it down figuring I had more time. I questioned this decision many times over the next few years as I was unsuccesful on the market, but this year I applied really broadly and finally got a great offer, so I'm really pleased that I waited.  9) Like 7 & 8, turned down an OK but not great offer at a west coast R2 early in my postdoc...but now 4 years later I still don't have a job! I still think there were things about that job that would not have worked well long term, but it is hard not to regret it when I can't even seem to get an interview now. 10) @9 saaaaaame. 11)#7 here again, in retrospect, I probably should have taken my offer and used it as a stepping-stone to get to where I want to be. It would have been a super tough and stressful year or two but getting that additional teaching experience on my resume would have probably given me the boost I needed to be competitive for the elite SLAC colleges I am applying for against all you super-stars on this wiki. 12) Same thing happened to me and taking a job as a stepping stone is what most of my peers are doing now. I should have done it.  4) The 3 folks that interviewed for the R1 TT  all have faculty jobs now.  It just took us a little longer.  Try to stay strong and I hope it works out for everyone.  12) I turned down a TT job that offered me $0 in startup, a very unclear teaching requirement and a salary that was less than my postdoc. There was minimal scope for negotiation. <--ick.  100% ick","Need papers to get job, but holiday season approaches, review takes forever, no papers probably until 2020, still waiting to hear from ~50 places.... bring on the eggnog. 2) I can recommend <https://altonbrown.com/eggnog-recipe/> 3) At least you're still waiting on 50 places...thanks to updates on this site my list that I'm waiting on is down to ~5. Eggnog indeed. 4) OP here, thanks #2 - #3: only because some of them are unfit for this board (Neuro jobs). If they were on here, I'm certain I'd only be waiting to hear from 6 or 7... the ones that haven't closed yet... :/ 5) I managed to get 2 on-site interviews last year with my main postdoc work still under review, definitely will make it harder, but if you are a good fit they might give you a look regardless  6) preprint if you can 7) I won't hire people that produce preprints  8) I won't hire people that don't. 9) @8 Why? (which could also be asked to 7, whose response was even more extreme :). 19) Why was 7 more extreme than 8? Bias much? 11) Well, a lot of people believe that preprints are good for science. Seems strange to penalize for that. Unless, 7 meant preprints and nothing else 12) People can believe what they like but if they cant coherently explain why unfinished, unreviewed work is good for science, im not going to agree with them. 13) Obvious troll is obvious. Where is this idea about ""unfinished"" work coming from? 14) If it hasnt gone through some kind of rigorous quality assessment (e.g. peer review), it's unfinished. Same for coding, literature, math proofs, music, and world sporting records. 15) Some cranky wiki-goers 'round these parts 16) I have seen that same comment ""obvious troll is obvious"" on this board for years. Hope you get a job soon, friend. 17) One thought is this: anyone can preprint. Further, we have seen, on this very wiki this year, ethical standards of research have been violated in preprints. When authors then tried to publish their preprint, they were denied publication in legitimate journals. 18) There are lots of better venues than a cell in a wiki that discuss the value of pre-prints  at length. But maybe if you're on a search committee it'd be better to actually evaluate (i.e. read or at least skim!) the work of your top few candidates in detail and form your own opinion about the quality of the work. Lots of garbage is peer-reviewed and lots of great papers are put up as pre-prints but won't be officially published until after job seekers current funding is gone (and of course I realize that isn't the only reason to pre-print). 19) I can tell you firsthand search committees don't read candidate papers, preprint or otherwise. Preprints are just a way to game the system to make it look like you are more productive. All it really says about a candidate is that they are highly invested in the game, which can say a lot in itself for certain search committees (e.g. you are more invested in looking productive than teaching a quality class). I will skim some papers to have something to talk to you about in an interview, but if you have made it to that stage we are now judging you based on your personality. 20) The peer review process has slowed down about threefold since I started out. That's some ""gaming the system"" there, removing the lag between submission and getting published in a journal. 21) But standards have also increased in that time and most papers need at least 1 round of major revisions before theyre good enough. 22) That hasn't been my experience. My last delay was caused by a late reviewer who recommended accepting in the first round (they said they were late in their report). 23) 20, preprint isn't publishing in a journal, so it doesn't remove lag time for publishing at all. It is the literal definition of gaming a system because it tries to circumvent it to appear like you are publishing. 24) blogging your work (essentially what you do by preprint) won't change the time to publication in a journal. how exactly is it a solution to long review times? I can't follow this logic, but that is probably why I don't follow this practice, it is illogical 25) Ok, boomer. 26) not a boomer, but good luck continuing to publish on blogs! byeeeeeee 27) Come on @26, I'm sure @25 is really moving the needle with their blog posts! 28) Preprints are no different than manuscripts in prep and are largely ignored by search committees. 29) Please job applicants, don't listen to 28, you'll be shooting yourself in the foot. I've been on a number of search committees, and I ignore ""in prep"" manuscripts that are just lines on a CV but do skim or even thoroughly go through preprints. And I know that there are many others that do the same. 30) No one is going thru a preprint unless the candidate has made the short list. And by then, its pretty much random who gets picked 31) Turns out they don't read your papers either... 31) @29 - some people do, others do not note preprints.  I pass over them.. and focus on peer-reviewed publications.  But I agree, if you have them, mention them under a separate header, but don't intermix because it is weak to do so. 32) One (admittedly anecdotal) observation, that I beleive is telling, is that it seems those who argue most vociferously that preprints count the same as peer reviewed journal articles are often those that have yet to publish many peer reviewed journal articles. 33) @32 - people like @mbesien are huge proponets of preprints. Looking at google scholar he has 250+ publications and 103848 citations. So my (admittedly anecdotal) observation says you are just wrong. Also NIH, HHMI, EMBO, CNRS and others either encourage the submission of preprints and/or suggest they are considered in hiring and fellowship decisions. (https://asapbio.org/funder-policies). 34) Are you appealing to authority instead of making a reasoned argument? Seems like a tactic that wouldnt get past peer review 32) @33, I wasn't implying that I don't think preprints have value in science (I absolutely think they do), or that highly published people don't think they are valuable. I just don't think preprints are a replacement for peer review, a point I would suspect most agree with. Yet the energy with which some argue that they should count the same on CVs etc suggests (at least to me) that some people seem to see them as a replacement or alternative to peer review. 35) This feels so pointless arguing on about this on an anonymous google sheet, but it feels important to counter those who say or imply ""preprints are worthless."" And I do truly beleive that they can be as valuble (or more) than a peer-reviewed paper. Ex. A brand new preprint that is clearly ground breaking and has a lot of positive comments could easily be worth more than a 10 year old published article with only 5 citations. Especailly when applying for jobs, where recent work is what matters and peer review can take a very long time, get your stuff out there and let a search committee see your work. Sure, people could try to game the system by putting up inferior or incomplete work as preprints to look more productive, but if that is enough to trick a SC, to me that is the SC not doing its job. Ok. I have my job offer and I don't want to spend more time on this discussion, so I am out. btw I have never done a preprint. 36) For someone who thinks its pointless to argue about it, @35 writes a lot about the topic. Maybe instead of waxing about how a preprint ""could"" be good, lets stick to the fact that preprints arent peer-reviewed and therefore should never be seriously considered by committee members that have to go through hundreds of applications.","Chinese universities Can anyone provide information, here or in the international comparisons tab, on the Chinese university and tenure system, particularly for foreign visa-holders who don't speak the language? 2) I started a row on the international comparisons tab with some observations from colleagues. OP) Thank you! 2) No problem; in all honesty I don't think foreigners are very happy there and I don't know of any who have pursued a long-term TT career there. Hong Kong and Taiwan have much more functional academic systems, IMO. 3) Why don't you think foreigners are very happy there?  I've suspected that this is the case, but not sure of the reasons why. 2) Besides the intense pressure to publish and get tenure, unless you're fluent in Mandarin you will never fully integrate into the university or local community. Couple this with extreme censorship by the govt and you can probably see why it'd be a drag to work there. Universities in mainland China are very much less internationalized than anywhere else I've visited (including over much of E. Asia), and you almost never hear of foreign academics remaining there long-term.OP) That seems consistent with what I've heard.  Do universities provide means for foreign faculty to integrate, such as language lessons, etc? Surely it would be in their interest too to keep faculty around, since it's probably expensive to bring them over. 4) As a postdoc in China I had access to Chinese lessons though I didn't take advantage of them, I don't know what the situation is outside of my former academic institution 5) Can anyone add information for other Asian universities, such as Singapore, South Korea, India, Taiwan, and Hong Kong?"
"women in academia as i (a female) repeatedly see biology/ecology departments vastly dominated (still!) by men and that many woman are (still!) well known to not make it past the postdoc stage (statistically much less than men), thought some of you might like to see this web page: http://www.humboldt-foundation.de/web/kosmos-cover-story-94-1.html (1) But are the departments dominated by mean dominated by older men? I'm certainly not questioning that gender discrimination exists. But is the gender imbalance less severe among younger faculty? In the bio department where I did my PhD, the last 4 new hires were all women. Perhaps as older faculty retire, they are replaced by a more even mix of men and women. I'm curious if others see the situation improving (and I know, the plural of ""anecdote"" is not ""data""). 

(2) ESA has been interested in this topic for a while. See http://www.esa.org/education_diversity/diversity.php for some reports. One interesting figure I extracted from the ""Profiles of Ecologists Report"" is pasted to the right. Assuming respondents are still ""in the game"" at different ages, I see an even mix up to the 31-35 age class (postdoc), then around a 2:1 male:female ratio in 36-55 (asst, assoc, early full prof). The ratio is more skewed for later ages. On the other hand, there's definitely been progress towards a balanced sex ratio since the 1992 survey. (3) Blah , blah, blah, Maybe men just respond more often, or maybe women are smarter, and don't waste their time with this kind of stuff...
(4) So it is up to all of us to fix this, by encouraging talented female students, by advocating for decent maternity and paternity leaves, on-site childcare, and for an academic environment that tolerates diversity.

(5) @3 that may be, but doesn't affect the temporal trends (6) right on, #4 and, exactly, #2 women aren't getting passed the postdoc stage (compared to men) - there's been a number of articles on this in Science and Nature too. (7) Shit! I'm male and I definitely feel that I can't get pass the postdoc stage as of right now. (And probably can't even keep that for much longer any more.) Who the hell is writing articles about me?
(8) Four of our last 9 hires were female, 8 of those 9 being replaced were white males...looks like progress to me.
(9) My take is that overall, while ecologists are trying to be more egalitarian, many ecologists are being hired for general Biology departments, and much of the biomedical fields are still ""Old Boys Clubs"" (10) the fact is departments that are still dominated by men, i think, are still more likely to pick a male.  In fact that is demonstrated by the stats, where women have greater chances of getting hired if a woman is on the search committee.  The stats shown in the ESA report (above) are quite telling","Notre Dame Ecologist Notre Dame ecologist position was accepted -- anyone know her/his research area? 1) aquatic ecology :), ecosystem and microbial focus",NA,NA," How hard is it to capitalize school names in the ads?

I'm under the impression I'd be lucky to get a few thousand in startup at most.  I like the area, the focus on teaching, and the salary is good...am I crazy for considering this?  My current research is not cheap, but with research expectations low (1 paper for tenure) I feel like I could learn to cheap-ify it, I guess it could be sink-or-swim.  Anyone else looking into schools like this? (2) The rule I have heard is to make sure you get what you need to be successful. Could you do your research with some undergrads doing local field work and using pen and paper to take observations? Does the department have shared equipment that covers your needs? Will you get internal money to pay for summer students / travel / field work? If you won't be able to get any research done don't take the job - you'd be setting yourself up for failure. 3) It all depends on how important research is to you. I am guessing that you could get at least one paper out on something in 4-5 years (especially if it does not have to be first author or in a high-impact journal). However, if that level is too low for your personal job satisfaction...then you need to think hard about that decision. I will say that I am not surprised by a low start-up at an SLAC. Many are really struggling finanically. The elite school still provide low 6 figures but that is becoming increasingly rare. 4)  if the school doesn't offer anything, I'ld worry about their financial situation.  Seriously.  Even one of the most strapped institutions I've ever been around scraped together 5K.  ","Three rejections in one afternoon.  Yep, today was a good day.   2) My record was twice in a day. 3) Guess it just takes one offer to make it worth it.... 4) I got two rejections today.  I'm actually grateful for the places that tell me the search is over.  Most just leave me in limbo forever  5) the only thing worse than no offer, is getting one, taking the job, and discovering it was one of the worst mistakes of your life.  Already did that one. 6) I agree with 4) and 5).  I was on the fence with one of the positions but stoked about the prospects of the other two.  I'm considering asking the search chairs for some feedback so that I can improve my application package for the next cycle. 7) To #6.  Let me know if you get any feedback other than ""fit.""  I never have. 8) I think it is a good idea to ask search chairs (especially if you had an on-campus interview). There is no harm in it. If they say fit, then so be it. I have had some say useful things. A number of search chairs understand what the competition is like and want to helpful. 9) most wont say due to hr reqs to avoid lawsuits, since most BARELY follow the rules, let alone their own job descriptions 10) Yes, unless you know them personally and know to trust you, it's unlikely they will answer you  because of EOA/AA potential lawsuits.  It's always due to fit.  They either want you for whatever reason or they don't.  It's that simple.  It's cold and tough, but that's the way it is. 11) Yes, it is always about the fit. As in ""We advertised for general XXXology, but in fact we prefer a potato specialist, because we already have five potato specialists. We invited you because we liked your CV, but see, your model systems are sloths and not potatoes, and so we decided, sorry, the other candidate was the better fit."" 12) EXACTLY, #11. Story of my fucking life this year on the market.  13) Another popular variant: Candidate X has neither grant money nor writing experience nor teaching experience and will be unable to establish his own research agenda, BUT he is the better fit because he worked for Super Dude at Rockstar University AND can analyze our data for us!","Clemson postings? When preparing a research seminar for a campus interview that also includes a future research chalk talk, how much future/site-specific content is expected as part of the seminar? 2) this is a good question. I think you should ask them for more details about the particular format of the chalk talk first. 3) Research seminar won't have your grant aims and details about the studies you are planning in future. It also won't have your timeline and alternative plans should your planned aims not support your hypothesis. Research seminar should prime them for what you will talk about in your chalk talk, though not explictly. Good luck. OP) Thanks",This potato/tomato convo made my shitty day.,"Inappropriate questions  So far in my job search I've been to 4 campus interview. 2/4 of those interviews have involved questions about whether I am married/what my spouse does/if I have children. I know this is not allowed, but how can you not answer? I am a married women and my husband is also an academic. We're obviously hoping to both get jobs. It's frustrating because it's unclear whether my answer affects the search outcome. Interestingly, my husband has also been on a few interviews (wearing a ring) and has never been asked about a spouse/family or really anything inappropriate. Curious whether women might experience more of these ""illegal"" questions than men. 2) I've been on three interviews (deliberately not wearing any rings or identifying jewelry) and partner/children questions have always come up. To their credit, in many cases they're couched in ""I know we can't ask you this"" terms and seem as though the person is just trying to give me info on childcare, spousal hire policies, etc. But I definitely feel that if I don't say anything about my family status, I'll be perceived as standoffish. And if I am offered the job, I'd hate to ""spring"" a request that they look into a position for my partner on them. 3) 2 - all understandable, but don't hate to ask them anything; this market demands so much of you, candidates have every right to ask for that. They (should) know exactly what the market is and how many good candidates have a 2-career issue. 4) 2 here again. Thanks for the encouragement, and I agree. I meant only that it would feel a bit rude if I hadn't given them any warning of it during the interview. This has definitely been a point of contention among senior faculty I've asked: two thirds said ""Don't say anything unless you absolutely have to!"" but a few said, ""Well, you should try to give this information to at least one person on the search committee so that they are prepared."" 5) OP here. I do wear a ring, but I've been back and forth about whether I should or not. These questions are not ""I know we can't ask you this"", but instead are ""casual"" conversations in social settings, explictly asking ""are you married, what does your husband do"". There's no way out of those questions - if I point out that they can't ask this, I'll look standoffish and like someone they probably don't want as a colleague (not to mention, it pretty much gives them their answer anyway). And I'm uncomfortable with outright lying. #2 - If you're not explicitly asked, I wouldn't offer up the info. I feel like you can respond to conversations about child care and spousal hires without relating it back to you (""oh, that's great that your institution is so supportive!"" or something to that effect). I have always been advised not to mention a potential spousal hire until you have a job offer. Getting a job is challenging enough - although we want two TT positions, we're willing to compromise in the short term if we need (i.e. postdoc funding etc. for the other spouse). Can't even make those compromises without an offer though. 6) There is always a dual career issue https://tenureshewrote.wordpress.com/2015/12/10/dual-careers-one-academic/ 7) Now that I've been on a few interviews at R1s, I personally feel I've worried too much about this. Yeah, I wouldn't come out and say ""I have a two-body problem that makes me unlikely to move here to take this job."" But I really don't think it matters if people find out you have a spouse/partner/kids -- they're still going to go for the best person/fit for the job.  8) AGREE with 7 on this (male, 2.5 years into a sweet R1 job).  On my interviews, this did come up but usually in the context of someone wanting to tell me how nice town XX was to raise a family-- they wanted to impress me with how this was a nice place to be.  Now that I'm on the other side of things, if spouse etc comes up in conversation, I just keep it to myself and absoultely do not bring it up with other faculty later when discussing candidates' qualifications for job, and this type of thing is absolutely not a basis for decisions about candidates later. ","Please be more careful when fixing cells.  I understand that things get accidentally deleted, but make sure you copy the right cell.  I just got really excited because an update said that an offer had been declined (giving me a chance) only to realize a couple hours later that someone had copied the wrong info in.","second round of interviews How common is a second round of interviews? I have been told by the SC that they have already interviewed people, but have not made an offer and are still interested in me. But I'm guessing a second round is very unlikely...? 1) I did one where it was clear that they had interviewed people and then invited me after the fact.  I haven't heard of any other instances of this happening and it didn't result in an offer for me. 2) I know someone who got an offer in the second round. Thats because all the first 4 candidates rejected the offer. In a different field. 3) I was on a search committee where it happened once (second rounder was offered and accepted position) and it happened to a friend of mine (secound rounder who was offered and accepted the position). From my n of 2, I would say that if a second round is being brought in for an interview, it's probably better to be in the second round; e.g., in both the instances above, the first round resulted in no candidates that the faculty wanted to offer the job. 4) I was once brought in on a second round that occurred the following fall - after the top 2 candidates took jobs elswehere the faculty decided not to repost the position but allowed their long list to submit updates before they brought in 3 more candidates  5)  Now, now, now, on the flip side.  I interviewed for my current job with 2 other folks and then they brought in a second round with two others.  Somone from the second round got the offer and rejected it and then the offer went to me, so don't give up.  Even though a lot of folks seem to be having a hard time getting jobs, many still reject offers, so you're still in a good spot. 6) It happens. Did the search chair reach out to you or vice versa? If the former, then I'd guess that they don't want to offer the position to anyone they have interviewed thus far and are soliciting support from the university or department to invite more candidates. Good luck. OP again) I contacted the SC. Thanks for the comments, friends, I guess I will hold on to some hope. 7) Side bar here, but I interviewed for a job in the 1st round, where they did a 2nd round (no correspondance with me as the candidate about this). I probably shouldn't have been po'd about it (of course it is all within their rights), but I was. It is hard to control feelings when your life situation is hanging out there. In fact, I had decided that if the offer did fall to me somehow, I would decline (never did). Got a job elsewhere, but I still feel this reflected poorly on the SC/Dept. 8) My experience has been that this is more common when committees ""cast a broad net"": they often interview a few outstanding scientists with a wide range of interests, but then have difficulty with the fit part. Kind of an argument against the wide net approach because it can reflect poorly when they ultimately can't decide or drag it out. 9) That's when committee members start thinking about their own interests and hire a 'pet'. Open ended searches like this are crazy for everyone involved. 10) <-Totally on the money 8+9. The wide net strategy always sounds like a great idea at the outset, but it can become a trap and result in odd moves! Seems to only work at elite schools. I favor advertising for what you're actually looking for, and figuring that out beforehand(!), rather than figuring it out as you go. I actually find the later strategy slightly lazy and unprofessional and have battled against this philosphy on SCs.","Finding out in middle of interview process that salary for asst prof at an institution in one of the top 3 most expensive cities in the US is nearly the equivalent of my postdoc in a less expensive area. Seriously, how do you expect to attract talent and pay the bills on a salary that is barely the break-even point after rent, taxes, and expenses? I guess better to find out now than later. Any other folks have SC tell them salary mid-interview process?  2) PhDs are a dime a dozen now, so it's an employer's market.  I guess take your choice: take a potentially permanent job with mediocre starting pay or keep playing the field with no guarantee that you'll ever get another offer, let alone a *better* offer.  However, before you turn the job down, make sure you also check how salary increments work.  Salary can increase very rapidly at some institutions. 3) There's a PhD ecologist from a well-to-do family with a high-earning spouse that'll take that job. With a glut of PhDs, the system weeds out people with modest incomes with amazing efficiency. 4) Not to point out the obvious but most TT salaries are for 9 months and post-docs are 12 months. You can teach during the summer or get a grant to cover your summar salary and research. 5) OP, can you share what region you're interviewing in? I have one coming up in an expensive city and want to see if I should ask sooner rather than later. Im wondering if its the same job. 6)OP - NYC metro 7) Is it one of the CUNY positions? 8) Make sure you ask if summer teaching is offered every year, and if the summer salaries are prorated based on enrollment. If you aren't doing field work over the summer or traveling, summer teaching a quarter is actually quite nice. Gets you in the building, usually only takes a couple hours 4 days a week, class sizes are typially small, and usually pays pretty well. 9) Huh, I think I'm interviewing at the same place. Good to know I'll need to be really upfront about it. What are they listing the salary as (or a range, if you odnt want to be specific)? 10) OP - not going to out institution or salary directly. $ is ~15-20K below living wage as calculated by MIT living wage calculator. 11) Thanks for the info, OP!   12) The search chair usually has no control over salary.  Negotiations depend much more on the dept head.  If they told you a number, it's usually to help you in negotiations, but may not be accurate. 13) FYI the CUNY salaries are set by the union. starting sal in bio should be at least 80K for 9 months. 14) CUNY salaries are also public--you can search NYC employees by name to see what people in the department are making ","startup budget timeline Do you provide the list of things you need before a formal offer? How long do you take between the informal offer and the moment you provide the list? Do you put in that list only lab/computer material or also money for moving? Do you also put things such as travel refund for fieldwork and conference, parking lot, etc? 2) The informal offer is where you do negotiating. The formal offer while come from the higher-ups and needs to include EVERYTHING you've agreed to in writing (including space, moving accomodations, timelines for spending startups...literally everything. Make sure its all there). Negotiate the start up seperate from salary, benefits (parking) and moving expenses. Include field work and conferences. Ask about how the money can be spent (e.g. if its equally split across three years, but you have a big equiptment purchase in Year 1, negotiate in that flexibility to say (60/20/20). Be specific in your lists and ask for everything you need. Hopefully you talked to faculty during the interview about ranges of startup expenses (e.g. you dont want to ask for 700k when the average is 70k). The offer can still technically be retracted during this window, so be reasonable and polite, but also be firm and make sure you get what you need to be successful for the next 5-7 years. 3) When I was negotiating it was clear this money was to be used (and expired) after 3 years. This will be an important clarification. I included travel to meetings, publication fees, equipment, computers, materials, chemicals, etc that would be needed in the first 3 years to get the ball rolling. The dean I was negotiating with made it clear which things were separate: salary, moving expenses, and start-up were all distinct items. There were also other items included like priority scheduling for teaching, explicit statement of teaching appointment obligations, and release from other obligations (university level service) for specified time lengths. 4) Lots of tips for negotiating salary, startup, teaching load, lab renos, and more here: https://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2017/03/01/tips-for-negotiating-salary-and-startup-for-newly-hired-tenure-track-faculty/","Just got an invite to ""dream"" job in-person interview.

About a week later I was emailed by the SC saying the department had not yet made their decision, and essentially to 'hold on'. I don't know what to make of this, or if the other candidates received similar emails. Is this a strategy that SCs use to keep other candidates interested during negotiations with their first choice? I'm just curious whether this is something anyone else has experience with, and could help me interpret what it might mean. 2) Could mean they are trying to negotiate a second position for you (or another candidate). Unless you personally know any of the candidates, I wouldn't advise contacting them.  3) The good news is that you've haven't gotten a hard no yet!  So you are still on the hook, for better or for worse. 4) I think contacting the other candidate would be a very bad idea, and would look very unprofessional if the word got back to the SC that you did that. 5) I don't think the OP was talking about making contacts with the other candidates, the point is that the SC is contacting other candidates while a negotiation with the main candidate is ongoing. 6) Sorry for the confusion, #5 is right, I wasn't thinking of contacting other candidates myself just trying to interpret what this email might mean, since clearly there is an ongoing negotiation with their first choice. 7) I am currently in negotiations for a position and was the top candidate for the position. However, a second position has now opened up because a current faculty member is leaving the department. It sounds like the department is going to try and hire another candidate from my same search but they probably need me to sign a contract first before offering the second position. The same thing happened to me last year, they filled the position with their top choice (not me) but then asked the university if they could add me as a second hire since one of the faculty was leaving. They made me the offer but in the end I turned it down so just hang in there and hope that you get the offer soon.  8) faculty at an R1 with a search here, where an offer has been extended to candidate #1 but there is a real possibility they will turn it down (spousal issues), in which case we will immediately go to candidate #2, who we also really liked. I won't contact candidate #2 to tell them what was up, and if they emailed I would not reply (since my email is a university email).  However, if they called ....  that's what the phone is for. Also, agree with #2, they might be trying to wangle a 2nd position from the dean. Not likely, but also not unheard-of. 9) OP here - I did end up getting the offer. I suspect that the first choice turned it down, as it does not appear to be a 2nd position. ","A vent from twitter: https://twitter.com/IBJIYONGI/status/1219991320623767553 2) ""Dear faculty who are hiring,  NOTIFY PEOPLE IF THEY ARE NO LONGER UNDER CONSIDERATION FOR THE POSITION BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN FILLED.

"Wiki is Crack and Crack is Wack! Just venting here: Despite how toxic this wiki has become (not all posts), I have become increasingly ""addicted"" to it, mostly because I'm in post-interviews waiting limbo. I'm finding it very difficult to do anything but check in on these spreadsheets periodically, rather than checking in my research data spreadsheets.  My unfinished manuscripts, data analyses, and grant proposals are all open on my computer task bar but I can't help myself to keep opening this damned wiki! Ahhh! I know I'm not the only one. I just glanced at another postdoc's screen across our lab and saw that she's on here too. ;) An aside, we crack up about the posts on here all the time! (1) Agreed and I didn't even get any interviews! (2) Agreed and I am about to accept an offer! (3) same here, ak! only because of in limbo too about status of my interview (4) I am totally incapacitated while I wait to hear back from SCs. There's nothing I can do but wait. Why not check the wiki every 10 minutes? (5) Yes, incapacitated! Am considering crawling under my desk and unplugging the ethernet cable from my computer for several hours a day so that I can get some work done! (6) I love/hate this blasted wiki!! Since my interview over a month ago, I cannot get any work done. I have two manuscripts that are in revision (i.e., need to be revised), a grant prop in the works, and am trying to prep for field work. I haven't managed to get in more than an hour of work without taking a peep on here. And, the blasted SC continues to string the candidates along during all of this. C'mon!!!! (7) I'm glad I'm not the only one that feels incapacitated and wondering if I should unplug the ethernet!  I feel rediculous, but quite anxious to hear some news.
8) Here I am again, wasting time on here. What really sucks is that most of us will probably be on here again next season.
9) You're right #8, most us will be on here next year, even those of us who accepted offers. It's likely that because of the sense of urgency due to the dismal job market, that many of us this year are accepting positions that are ""sub-optimal"". Thus, we'll be miserable in a year or two and combing this wiki to jump ship. ","McGill U. Has anyone heard anything about the animal behavior position at McGill? Not a peep. 2) I heard (from inside) that there were around 100 applications, a lot of multi-postdoc and mid-career people, so it's tough competition.",NA,NA,"Waiting I hate waiting.  Especially for the one school that would just be the perfect fit! 1) I saw one discussion on the CHE earlier where the advice is that you should let go once you submit an application and have done everything within your control about a position. Don't take anything for granted and don't over-think about anything. Also, never stop applying for other positions until you actually get an offer. 2) Don't stop applying for positions until you have signed the contract! 3) good suggestions! thanks 4) I hate waiting too (x3). 5) Tom Petty was totally right. 6) don't stop applying until you have signed the contract and started teaching. ","Travel costs reimbursement Just curious, how many of you that have had on-campus interviews have requested reimbursement for costs other than flights/travel such as food, coffee (!!), etc.? If so, indicate what type of university you interviewed at (R1, etc.). 2) Teaching institutions, several interviews, requesting reimbursement not an issue. In fact, was solicited by secretary.  3) Was told by the SCC of my recent on-campus (SLAC) to send receipts for any food I ate at the airport.  I didn't ask for reimbursement of any food, but only because I felt I could cover the cost of my own dunkin donuts :) 4) Been on three interviews, never had a problem with reimbursements for everything. The only bad part was it was SLOW. A couple of places took like three months to pay me back. 5) OP here, yeah I was mostly interested in whether they reimburse for expenses like the coffee I bought at an airport, etc. Obviously they should pay for all travel costs but they also should pay for any travel costs associated (like a per diem). Those costs add up!",Oh thanks. And someone deleted my vent about people deleting stuff here.... 2) I saw that and chuckled (as I shook my head) -- ridiculous,"closing dates I made a short list and the committee then requeted letters of rec to help them further narrow down the field. How long should I anticipate waiting to hear something if it is good news? Letters were due on Feb 20. 2) That is promising, but once a month has passed you can assume that you are not in the first round of interviews. But don't let that discourage you, especially for an R1 job. Those searches can take much longer. ",Your happiness made my day.,"Include next year? Any chance there can be a geographic component to the spreadsheet? Just a column with 'State' (or country if international), would be a big help in browsing. 2) Sure, don't see why not. 3) I second that motion.","I can't stand waiting anymore. Why does it take some of these schools SO LONG to move forward in their search processes? (Ie there are a couple schools that I emailed to ask where they were in their search process b/c I wanted to confirm I hadn't been kicked out and they are just ""taking longer than they had planned to go through applications"". I know that when you get a lot of applications it is a huge process to deal with them, but STILLLLLLLLLLL ARRRRRRRG X3 2) Oh lord, I know. I'm interviewing for a position 6 months after applications were due. I assumed they've moved on from me about 10 times in this process! 3) Enough with the humblebrag. 4) I don't think that 2's comments are a humblebrag - I think it's useful info! Come on folks, let's not give into despair and start snarking at each other yet x2 5) I agree with 4... anytime someone has something bad to say about interviews it's a ""humblebrag"". Let's lay off! 6) I know, it's so aggrevating. 6 of my campus interviews this year came after waiting 3 months! The subsequent offers from all 6 ($90K a year; $500K startup for all) took another 3 months! Of course, I turned them all down b/c they wouldn't give my spouse a janitors job in the biology building. One actually wanted my spouse to work in the chemistry building! Good thing I already am a full professor at an elite R1 where my spouse is a well published and funded physicist. It will be hard for anyone to pull me away b/c my parents were loaded and paid 85% of our 4000 square foot house at closing. The one thing I hate about my current position is the lack of teaching. It's pretty much voluntary and I get paid more if I ""volunteer."" I'm glad there is a forum where we can all get together and sympathize with each other. #thestruggleisreal ........now that's a humblebrag! 7) lol 8) #6, only $90K/year... were they part-time jobs? ;) 9) 2 month contracts. If I decide to work the rest of the 9 months on my own research, I get $90K for every additional 2 months. ","recruiting students If you lived and worked in a region and university that wasn't all that friendly toward minorities or women, would you actively recruit such students? I mean it would be the right thing, to increase diversity, but at the same time, you're exposing them to hate and abuse. It's more of a regional thing than the institution, though historically the institution has not had much experience in dealing with such issues. 2) Yes - don't make the decision for them - help them to get offers for grad school, including yours, and then let them decide what they want to do. x3 3) And tell them honestly about that before they come! 4) I'm a gay male and just took a position in a historically non-gay friendly area. It is quite rural, but is close enough to where I grew up (a mid-sized city) and close to family and friends. Had the search committee assummed I didn't want to move there, I might not have gotten an offer, despite my loving the position. So, I definitely say to allow the students to make the decision for themselves, rather than assuming their wants/priorities. 5) You realize that if every institution decides LGBT/minority/PoC/women don't want to be there (without asking) that student or postdoc will be out of a job?  Not recruiting or hiring people based on not-science is called prejudice.  It leads to reduced opportunities.  I don't understand why you would treat anyone differently because of their identity, if they have the same skill set.  If anything you could make it clear you will do your best to support them if prejudiced action does arise.  6) I am not about to let that one uber republican xenophobic asshole in my department stop me from getting a good student.  I'll do whatever I can to recruit them. (x2)","1) Just here to say that I feel so **bleh** trying to find a TT job. It is so depressing - the hype, then waiting to get a phone or skype interview, then waiting to get an on campus interview, then doing the interview, then more waiting and torture. And applying for jobs in places you maybe don't love, because those are the only academic jobs currently available for your speciality. I'm ""early career"" (<10 years post Ph.D.) and have been wondering what it would be like to just say ""see ya"" to the world of academia and move to my dream state where my heart is and always will be and just cobble together a job somehow. Have any of you done this? Considered doing it? Did it feel like ""giving up"" or did it feel like ""finally, I'm FREE and SO HAPPY."" I realize that no matter where you live and what you do for work you will probably never be 110% satisfied, but still. Just thinking out loud. 2) If I don't get a TT job or a choice fellowship by the end of my first postdoc (next year), I'll be doing this. 3) I've been a postdoc for over 5+ years with interviews but no job offers, and finally this year everything worked out (job offer and grant). Before that, I was very much getting ready to leave academia and never look back. To post #2, I'm assuming you are either already disenchanted by academia if you're only willing to stick it out for one year, or maybe being a little naive. Most people, even the very best researchers (a group that doesn't include me), are stuck in post doc positions for much longer. 4) 2 here: I'm actually a 3rd year postdoc and have done a bunch of interviews. Perhaps I'm just a pragmatist and not willing to put my family through more unneccessary moves when plenty of awesome opportunities to do meaningful work exist in far better places than wherever I manage to score an interview.  5) Ah, sorry #2, - 3 here: I misread your first post as stating that you were going to drop out if you didn't have a job by the end of your first year as a postdoc. 3+ years is more realistic! 6) to #1: I've done it, sort of. I moved to a place I absolutely love and negotiated to work remotely. I think it helped in the job search too, I started getting interview requests a year after I moved, which I attribute to a change in overall attitude and reduced stress from living in a place I really enjoy, which ""trickled down"" to cover letter, teaching and research statements. 7) OP, if I did what you suggest I can tell you one thing for sure: you would never see me back on this board commenting again! It does sound pretty appealing at this point, though I really don't know what kind of job I would be able to cobble together. 8) OP here, thanks all for providing some comments - it makes me feel less alone. to #7 - same here in terms of what kind of job to do/figure out. I've spent my whole life in school with the aim of getting a TT job and what does it mean if I decide to not pursue or don't get a TT job? That all those student loans and years spent surviving graduate school are for nothing? Has anyone left academia and then come back to it? Is that hard to do? 9) #8, I've known a number of people who have been in industry and then went back to a university, though generally they wind up at a smaller school as opposed to an R1. It's getting trickier to do nowadays because you have to have a continuous stream of productivity in terms of papers, but if you go take a private job and teach a night class at a community college you well may be able to get into a small college somewhere where undergrad ed is the focus. I'm actually trying to do this after almost two years in industry. 10) #8 I left academia  for 2 years straight after my PhD and came back. It's slightly different as I'm European and my PhD only took 3 years. I worked as a writer but got the chance to do a posdoc in US. Now I have a permanent academic job in Europe. I recently started to look for TT jobs in some of the regional universities in the US but have had no luck at all. My publication history is weak (7 papers; but in fairly high impact journals) and the SC don't seem to look past that despite my 2 year break and earning an MBA while doing my first postdoc. I'm probably going to leave academia again - foor good this time. That being said the University I had my heart set on does have a record of employing industry scientists with PhDs when they are expanding course offerings into new areas. So if you stay research focussed and generate papers you would still be competitive. 11) I am considering doing it right this minute (giving up on academia, that is). I am just tired of moving all over the globe (and broke too!), getting interviews but never the carrot. I am also tired of feeling insignificant at work, no matter how hard I work and no matter what type of lab I join. I am ""just"" a postdoc to other people, like gum on the shoe. Haha, well OK! ""Early career"" here too, 5 years past Ph.D. I've decided to go to a job fair to try and see what sort of industry work I may be able to do. I'll do what I can to avoid going back to school! ","tenure-track spouse Did anyone get lucky to accomodate spouse as tenure-track? Mine is already an assistant professor elsewhere, he would move at least as tenure-track. I got a job offer and still waiting...high hopes none optimism 2) I got a spousal accommodation, but its non-TT position. There is a path for it to become a TT track position, though. It also decreased my ability to negotiate startup and salary. 3) my offers have been ammenable to considering TT for my spouse (currently not an academic but has a PhD and has done a postdoc), but nothing firm yet.  4)  Seems like most I've seen have been non-TT roles, but have seen 1 TT spousal hire and a spouse come in as a non-TT and eventually get a TT position when money for a new line became available, so very, very variable. 5) I got a  spousal accomodation as a TT faculty. Some universities have programs that would help accomodate a spouse by paying a substantial portion of their salary, with the rest paid by main applicant's home department and spouse's potential department. Spouse still has to interview for such position and get an offer. Try asking around or searching the universities website for a similar program.   6)  I bet you it varies a lot between R1s, R2s, SLACs, etc. 7) I think it also varies depending on whether the university is in a location where there wouldn't be a lot of job opportunities outside the university or whether it's in a big city 8) Having looked into this A LOT and talked with a lot of people, I don't think it clearly varies by R1/R2/SLAC. It is very idiosyncratic to the institution and whether they have actual policies or a culture in place for doing this and of course how keen they are on enticing the first candidate to come. I do think region makes some difference (more likely in places without other job prospects, as 7 suggests), but even there the correlation is pretty weak. 9) Wondering about this too - how hard did you have to push to get TT? non-TT seems much easier for them to offer, but the roles are highly variable across departments and don't always come with startup research funding, space, ability to advise students, and other signs that there will be some independence rather than a glorified postdoc position. Any tips for negotiating a better non-TT deal?","In applications to UK universities, I *hate* writing the supporting statement addressing the person specification SO DAMN MUCH. It's long and painfully redundant. Each university's is quite different, so you can't even tweak/resuse materials. Maybe I just haven't figured out how to do it right? But it makes me want to claw my eyes out every time. 2) Beats wasting time applying to a job with no real description of what the department wants, and removes at least some subjectivity from the process. 3) I kinda agree with #1… I appreciate the specifics, but I'd rather see enough flexibility that I don't need to rewrite my materials for every application.  I've got 5 different sets of application materials, with different emphases.  I might tailor them slightly for a specific position, but overall I think I've got my bases covered.  And I always check the current faculty to see how well I'd fit, and whether the uni has facilities that I need for my research (detauks about which are often hard to locate online) before applying.  This takes time; it's sort of insulting to have to spend so much *more* time on what seems like bureaucratic details.","Contacting references after campus invite I just had a campus interview on Friday. They contacted my references early Monday morning to get letters and ask them questions over the phone. I've never heard of this before (contacting references after an interview). I'm guessing based on the timing that this just is part of their procedure (They simply haven't had time to have decided). Anyone ever hear of this? 2) This is common everywhere outside the United States (and Canada?) 3) Canada too! Happened to me in one Canadian place (only one I interviewed at) 4) I've had this happen in Norway, but not Australia, NZ or UK. 4) I had them call my postdoc advisor two weeks after the campus interview (in the US) as a ""quick reference check."" FWIW google search suggests some places do it for all on-campus interviewees as an HR requirement. 5) As a letter writer, I've had this happen twice in the U.S. It was very formal. I was emailed to set up a time to discuss the candidate. I was asked the same questions that every letter writer was asked. It was almost like I was the one being phone interviewed. 6) this is the standard procedure in my department; we typically do not ask for letters and just do phone calls to references of the finalists with a standard set of questions. I have many problems with letters so I like this better. Whether some of the same problems with letters (like the well-known phenomenon that references write worse letters for women) persist in this case I don't know, but I do think it's less likely when the reference is answering a set of standard and pointed questions.","Finally had a campus interview at a place I was actually super excited about. Thought it went really well. Found out on here that I didn't get it and it was basically my last open option for this year's job cycle. No actual official communication from the department to tell me I didn't get the job even though I was one of 3 or 4 finalists. AND, they still haven't reimbursed me for the travel that I paid for out of pocket ~8 weeks later. 2) you won't hear about the job until they have a signed offer letter, if at all (happened to me once). Re the $$, you should bug the admin person in charge of that. That's horribly unprofessional for the dept to do to you. x2 3) Staff probably hasn't been working for the past 3 weeks. 4) They should have paid for the big ticket items upfront. 5.) I had a similar situation happen last year, go up the chain to get your $ back. I had to pay everything except the hotel (plane and rental car) up front, and they were very difficult. I finally got my reimbursement by emailing admins within the department. It took almost 5 months... 6) Hang in there... I have learned to treat an on-site interview very much like submitting a job or grant app.  Try your best not to dream or fall in love - even if you got a great vibe. Even at the final four, there are still a lot of politics. 7) I was reimbursed from big R1 after almost 7 months of aggresively emailing multiple people. Plus never got an official rejection email/call even after a signed offer had been put out. Not fair 8) It probably means you were in the running for the job but not the first offer, and something about negotiations is dragging along - most don't want to finalize the ""no"" until ""yes"" is locked... offer made and offer accepted are not the same thing (and I've seen misinformation on here too). You really never know what could be going on behind the scenes. But, other good advice in this cell and I know what you're feeling is terrible. They should definitely reimburse you!",Tips for USGS coop jobs https://twitter.com/conversesj/status/1250600142467592194
"Wiki thoughts You know, the old Wiki did not suffer from all of the name calling, whining, etc. that this page now is filled with. It just listed the job abd the status, which is all we need, right?
2) A, worse job market, B, easier to post, and C, people are more used to using wikis.
(3) I'd like to think it's mostly A, but I have the feeling that it's a combination of B, C, and a bunch of jerks. Oops, there's that name calling again. ;) (4) I might have to double check, but I remember some fairly nasty language from last year's wiki. Probably still not as bad as some recent ones on here, though. (5) If people think this wiki is rough, wait until they get their first job interview! Think of it as practice. We need a top 10 douchebaggery list so all the nasty comments are in one place. I have a heck of a time trying to find them whenever someone complains. I love douchebags! (6) I just accepted an offer, and I still check the wiki multiple times a day. Not for jobs anymore (although I still post new info I get from my other apps), but for new douchebags! Watching some of these people blow off steam (i.e., be a complete douchebag to someone who doesn't deserve it) by sniping at their colleagues is a great motivator for finishing my dissertation. I wonder what some of them are like in person without the cloak of the wiki. (7) Oh great, now we have an ABD with a job on here, what a DB! (8) 6 here. I understand your jealousy in this job market, but I didn't mention my job to rub it in anyone's face. I merely was pointing out how funny it is to watch all the DBs. In fact, since I have always contributed information on jobs to the wiki, and still do even when I have nothing to gain anymore, I would say I'm much less of a DB than many on here (see the post on 2/19). But, if I'm a DB because I was lucky enough to float to the top of a pile of applications and good enough to succeed at the resulting interview, I can live with that. (10) I am so over the word ""douchebag"" constantly used on this wiki - who uses that word anyway - geez. It really disturbs me that these people are our colleagues. To those of you calling names and putting down others - Grow up folks, be professional, and learn to treat others with respect and compassion. (11) I have to say, most of the reason I laugh at people calling others DBs on this wiki is because I haven't heard that word in general use since about 8th grade. Maybe some of the other posts have some truth to them...there ARE a bunch of grade schoolers on here. As 6, the ABD DB ;), said above: I wonder how these people are in person? Anonymity counts for a lot as far as bravery goes when name calling, but some of this douchebaggery (I learned that one on the wiki) has to leak into their real lives. 12) This is a venting and ranting page for the current (2009/2010) ecology job search, not a name calling forum for anonymous disrespect and derision. Let's not rip on or ridicule each other. Let's please stop the name calling. And, let's anonymously treat everyone on here with respect. I've seen some very compassionate and respectful posts and replies on here and I know that most of us (~99.5%) are good spirited and collegial people. When I read those posts, I sincerely feel good about our field and our peers. Let's continue to be encouraging and show empathy towards one another. Please don't be so quick to condescend on your peers in here. Let's move on. Thanks and good luck to all of you! 
13) I took #7's DB comment @6 to be one of jest...sort of ""damn you for being fresh out of PhD but yet getting a job before me! But good on ya."" I only think that because I thought the same thing in my head when I read s/he was ABD. BTW, I am the OP of the ""douchebaggery"" comment that popped up on this wiki, and I don't care how prudish you are, it's just plain funny.  My postdoc friends think it's funny, my tenured friends think it's funny, even my postdoc sponsor, she thinks its funny.  It's the silliness and immaturity, while not directed at anyone specifically, that makes things fun in this all too serious business we're in. (And that makes me a douchebag for ending my sentence in a preposition.) 14) 12 again, I'll add that we can be everything I ask above (i.e., respectful to each other) AND be funny and humorous as 13 states. Sure, we can have fun and be silly and use this as an outlet for our frustration but not at the cost of making others feel bad. (case in point: Reply #8 on 2-20-10 under REJECTED post) Hilarious! Enjoy!  (15) 6/8 here.  After reading 13 I looked again at 7...it definitely could have been meant as a joke.  It's hard to get tone from a typed comment, and I flew off the handle because I've tried to help others as others have helped me on this wiki.  So, sorry if it was a joke...and if it wasn't...you're a douchebag! ;)  By the way, 13, I swore to use douchebaggery every day in conversation after I saw it on here...so far, so good.  
(16) #7 here - joke, joke!  I forgot ABDs were so sensitive! (another joke!  I am really saying congratulations a million, you obvs did a terrific job!) (17) #5 here - Lighten up serious folks. Douchebaggers rule. Enough of the doom and gloom commentary and the let's-all-be-friends Kum-Ba-Yah rallying. There's always a positive flip side to the job market / wiki - like reading douchebag comments. Keep 'em coming. And thanks to the poster who set up the Top 10 Douchebaggery Comments. It made my day. (18) My pleasure <blushes> Seriously, it was meant to lighten up the mood.","U. Northern Colorado offer, declined.... Was wondering if the person who was offered the job at UNCO would be willing to discuss why they did so....other offer, etc? Thanks! 2) Hi, I'm the one and I'd be happy to. It was actually a very tough decision because I LOVED the faculty group there. Everyone is very friendly, hard-working, congenial, and interesting. It came down to a few interacting things for me. a) Salary and start-up were both quite low. b) Teaching load is high and they officially use a ""teacher-scholar"" approach which places a lot of emphasis on teaching. This could actually be a huge benefit for someone who is more focused on teaching then I am. I genuinely enjoy teaching, but my main reason for being in this field is research and I felt I wouldn't be able to do the kind of science I really want to do while also being a good teacher in the number of courses they wanted. That said, the folks there do some very good science, so some might be better at making it work than I. c) The location was not very desirable. Yes, it is CO, but Greeley is not particularly appealing, not much of a college town, most of the faculty live elsewhere and commute. I seriously considered this option and realized I really don't want to commute a long way to my job and I couldn't live in Greeley. All things together made it clear to me that this just wasn't the best fit for me, despite how much I liked the faculty. I think it could be a great place for someone else, though. (3) If they stress teaching so much, why did they interview and extend an offer to a candidate that prioritizes research??? (4) I can't speak for the candidate, but I put myself out there as being able and willing to do any combination of teaching and research. For me personally it is the truth, but my point is that if I do my part successfully, the SC has no idea that I might not be what they're looking for (in this case that the candidate ""prioritizes research""). If I get an offer, the ball is then in my court to decide whether the pros outweigh any potential cons (in this job's case a big teaching load). If the pros are good enough, that SC will never find out that I had been hoping for more research. If they aren't, I decline the offer like this candidate did. Again, I can't speak for him/her, but that's how I would have handled this situation. (5) Thanks for the response and honesty. much appreciated. 6) Offeree here again. All good thoughts. One thing, though, that I obviously didn't make clear enough is that it wasn't just the teaching load that made me decline. In fact, the location played a very large part in my decision. Like I mentioned, the current faculty are able to get some good research done. Also, the department does want people who prioritize research, but they also want them to prioritize teaching, something that takes a lot of work. If the University had been in a wonderful place, then I think it would have been worth putting in the extra work to prioritize both, but if I was commuting two hours a day and couldn't stand the town where I worked, it is unlikely that I would have been sane enough to actually get the necessary work done. It really was the suite of things all together that made it not a great fit for me. (7) @ Offeree: seems like most, if not all of the downsides might have been known in advance of your interview... no? (8) so what's your point...they should have never applied? (9) @8: essentially. Or barring that, bowing out at any of the earlier phases. However, the search committee bears at least a equal share of the responsibility.(10) we all know how much effort and angst we go thru applying and dreaming of a life in a new place-- don't pick on the oferee, I've applied to places I wasn't sure about- as many of us must have given the answers we provided in the ""Surveys""-- the offeree likely has spent lots of hours mulling this over. (11) To offeree - did you get a better offer elsewhere that made you decline this position? Or are you waiting on an imminent offer? (12) I concur with #10, I have applied to places that would not be my number one geographic choice, and I have declined offers after I visited a locale that seemed okay on paper (more properly the web). In this game you are far better off applying to anyplace that fits your bill, getting multiple interviews, decline those you have second thoughts about either before or after a visit (tenure is a long, long time) . And pick the best among the multiple offers you get. Works for me. (13) Legitimate strategy, but not so efficient. 14) Offeree here again. I am still waiting to hear on one last offer, so I declined without another sure thing. As I said it was a really tough decision as I had to decide which would be less appealing, being there, where I didn't think I would be happy (due to location) or as productive as I could be, or possibly waiting another year and facing an uncertain future. In my case it made sense to face uncertainty, but that might not be the case for everyone, obviously. This process is not easy. These are not just ""jobs"" these choices have a huge impact on where we will spend our working lives. It is not necessarily easy (or fair) to just move on to another faculty job in any market, but especially this one. As for knowing ahead of time...one just never knows. I had never been to Greeley, so I had no idea what it would really be like. I only applied to jobs within a specific geographic region and only to doctoral universities, so I wasn't just tossing out a broad net. But there are lots of schools that fit those bills and I don't know much about most of them. You may know ahead of time that a place is not your ideal, but until you visit you really don't know whether it would be a good place for you. I know lots of people that have been surprised.  (15) Agree with 11:  it sounds like the offeree thought a lot about this decision and did the best he/she could with the information available!  We don't all have the ability to see a place for a couple days and then make a decision if we could live there on the plane ride home.  


",NA,NA," This is for the benefit of department chairs, search chairs, and others in positions of power during an interview: DO NOT say anything like ""when can you start?!"" even jokingly, to the first candidate who interviews. I was that candidate, and I left campus feeling very good and very confident. Everything had gone so well. And then suddenly it hadn't and the committee had hired someone else. I think it's like reviewing a paper; you shouldn't reveal your recommendation to the authors unless you KNOW what the fate of the paper is going to be. Except in this case it's someone's life/future/career we're talking about-- someone who was really attached to this job, this institution, this geographic location, this dream that suddenly got stomped on. So don't make promises that you can't keep. End of rant. ","notification etiquette ? 1) At what point is it proper to write to the search chair to inquire about the status of the search if you haven't heard anything?  I had a terrific (in my mind) skype interview and was told that the campus interviews would be scheduled for February.  I haven't heard anything and so am wondering if I am no longer being considered a candidate.  Would it be tacky to ask the status of my application? Thanks!  2) You are probably on their second list and perhaps contacted if their first short list runs into problems. I cannot envison how contacting them will help your case though. 3) Agree with #2. Contacting them is a bad idea. They'll call/email you. Expect the worst at this point. 4) I have to agree, it's not like they want to contact you but forgot your contact info.  Expect the worst and be pleasantly surprised if their timeline was just off. 5) OP - Thanks for the advice! 6) On the other hand, contacting the search chair to get closure can be cathartic. It really doesn't hurt. No search committee has ever said, ""you know, I was going to invite him/her for an interview, but s/he called about the job and seemed needy so let's not do it after all."" 7) Closure can be good, but if you are seeking closure on the academic job market, you are really going to be fucked up mentally. Just expect nothing and be happy if you get a physical rejection or, glory be!, a job offer.",I think it's great that when people don't agree with something they simply delete it on here. So may threads on the Discussion are now gone. Guess we can't have anything nice. 2) What got deleted?  3) I disagree!!!! ;) 4) so 3 you believe in censorship? Hopefully that karma is catching up with you.  5) don't worry #3. some of us recognize a joke when we see it. hope you end up working with me and neither of us ends up working with #4.,"Closing Dates Although the presence of the wiki has been great to get some more information about the hidden world of the search, it does not appear to be very successful overall. Currently there are about 440 jobs listed on the TT vacancies for which there is no resolution. There are about 40 jobs listed as accepted on the accepted page. Thus, on average, only about 10% of the jobs are seeing some resolution to the end. I think this is an issue of knowledge about the wiki itself. I have not talked to a single colleague over the past few years who knew of it. I think if someone is going to do 2015-2016 wiki, they should put signs up at the Ecology meeting in Baltimore letting people know about it (especially post docs). The more people that know about it the more it will get updated. My 2 cents. 2) I think this depends on how you define ""success.""  For me, it has been very helpful to see posts on jobs I applied for that have moved on to phone/campus interviews without me.  The final outcome is probably the least important bit of data for me. 3) 1 again, I was using the filled vacancies as a proxy for all info known. Do some ads out of the 440 have some info that could be helpful? Sure, but there are a lot of ads where no info was ever posted (no short lists made, not interviews scheduled). Ideally you would want all that for every job, so telling more people about it would likely produce greater 'success' in the info. 4) I personally think the issue is less about overall use and visibility than it is about participation and engagement. This place is riddled with ""lurkers"" who apply for jobs and take take advantage of the updates without ever posting anything themselves. To me this is equivilent to submitting but never reviewing papers. I would encourage organizers to find ways to boost participation from the users rather than boosting the visibility of the wiki overall. Almost everyone I know who is job searching is aware of and uses the wiki in some way. I suspect the lack of engagement stems from 1) the ol' selfish fear of others ""getting the job I applied for"", hence I will post nothing and 2) fear of ""being found out and exposed"" be it by SCs or other applicants. 5) I agree with ""2"" - I've found it quite useful - I'm looking mostly at PhD granting institutions and it seems these are generally updated - I also agree that the final outcome is usually the least important, but I think it's great if people that accept the position ad this info (I've been on 3 campus invites where I was never informed that I did not get the job) 6) Not sure what you expect.  some news is better than no news. 7) I'm so curious how many people use this site -- clearly it's more than the 55 or so people who have filled out anon qualifications... 8) so 6, if some news is better than no news why have the wiki? just wait for the seach chairs to contact you (or not). If there is a +linear relationship between those who update and those who visit, then I'm for having more people know about it.. 9) great resource, provides information. if you don't like it, these posts won't change anything. just enjoy all the benefits here or don't check it. (10) +1. 10) Most of the jobs I applied for did have updates (and I added mine!!!), and it was really useful. I suspect that a lot of the unresolved ones are the result of people who get and accept offers never coming back here again. Not very nice. Though I will admit that I forgot for a week or so to post my acceptance of my new position because this wiki is just not the first thing you think of when you finally, finally make it! [From Colby College Notes: 6) If 3 people using this page applied and 3 people got rejections, should this listing get moved somewhere?  Or deleted? -- might be a way to discourage lurkers who don't participate? 7) Don't be stupid, a lot of people participate without necessarily adding a # to the ""# individuals that applied category"" - it's basically a meaningless category, plus it can be hard to keep track of what jobs you added a # to and which you didn't 8) Wow, sounds like you must find really simple tasks to be quite challenging.] 11?) I don't get how ""# individuals applied"" is a useless category.  Maybe it should be ""# individuals interested"" and after the closing date, it gets deleted if there isn't a number there to reduce clutter.  If you want to keep seeing it there, add a number. 12) Nope. Uncluttered is all relative. If that's what you want, download it and edit it to your heart's content. A posting with no updates get dropped to the bottom by virtue of the date sorting feature, anyway.13) in 2004 the wiki was nothing, jut 3-4 posts with nothing going on.  Malcolm Mcallum made some changes and then promoted on ecolog a lot back then.  It was really used a lot when I first found out about it in 2005-2006.  But, then some A-holes started vandalizing it. I remember he stopped managing it a few years ago, and with that it kind of stopped getting promoted much.  People won't know its there unless we keep reminding them it exists.  I agree it needs to be promoted a lot.   14) I think it's great...PLEASE KEEP IT!!!",This process is the final insult to a putative academic.,"Mention alumni in cover letter? Just applied for a position, and after I sent the cover letter, it occurred to me that I have 3 family members that are alumni of the institution. Does it seem goofy to mention that in a cover letter? I myself did not attend that institution. Thoughts? 2) I would not. 3) Well. How would that help your application? 4) OP here. My thinking was that I could show I have a connection to the institution, even though I live far away. Which brings me to my next question: is it relevant to mention that one has family in the area where the institution is located? 5) I don't think either would hurt. The alumni connection won't help either, but maybe it could provide an icebreaker for someone to use on you? The family-in-area one has a small chance of helping a teensy bit, if someone on the committee would otherwise think you wouldn't move there.  But very small effect size and there are plenty of other ways to convince folks that you'd move there. 6) Seems like something you could mention in conversation. Putting it in a cover letter seems weird to me - too many ways your point could be misinterpreted. 7) Agreed. This will look very sketchy and perhaps desperate in the cover letter. Better to show your research of the school in other ways. 8) OP here. Thanks for the feedback! I'm glad I sent it without mentioning the connection. From the perspectives weighed in here, it does seem rather gauche. 9) I didn't mention it in a cover letter, but mentioning that I had a lot of famliy that were alumni was particularly effective when meeting with the dean at the on-campus interview. She asked how I knew about the school and why I was confident that I would be a good fit, and I mentioned that my family had a long history of attending various colleges within the university and that the school has always been held in high esteem by my family. She seemed pleased with me having a personal connection with the school, even if it wasn't directly mine.","So it begins... 2) What?  The end decent job postings for the 2016-2017 job season?  Yes, pretty much.  3) Sure, but also the four year winter.  4)  Shit, he'll probably want more folks with federal loans, so enrollment may go up and jobs openings may increase.  There's gotta be some silver lining. 5) no, there's no requirement for shit to have a silver lining. 6) There is always a 2nd (albeit smaller) wave early in the year. Keep the faith. 6) Remember that there will be jobs outside the US advertised all year.  7) Any advice on where to look for international positions? 8) I don't know of a wiki for international jobs specifically, but try https://www.timeshighereducation.com/unijobs and http://academicpositions.eu/ and http://www.nature.com/naturejobs/science/  9) For Canada: http://www.universityaffairs.ca/search-job/ 9) http://www.jobs.ac.uk 10) Anything for jobs in Asia? Looks like they might have really good research funding these days and are growing their research base.  11) Most of the jobs I've seen are for China 12) Lots of good opportunities in China now. 13) The Times Higher Ed site has lots of jobs in Asia  14) To every non-US job that laughed when I said I wanted to leave: FUCK YOU.  FUCK ALL OF YOU. I could have left!!!","Half day interview?  I've had on-campus interviews that were a full day (arrive night before, have interview next day, leave next morning), but I have a half-day interview coming up. Has any one had one of these and have any experiences to share/suggestions? 1) No, but that sounds way better-  all of mine have been 1.5-3 days.  I would make sure you really think about what message you get across and what questions you really need answered, since you'll have limited opportunity to make an impression and gather information.  2) Only in Europe. (x2) 3) I had a half day interview, partially due to weather conditions but also I think all the meetings were all they had planned. In my case, I was brought in when there was an inside candidate so I feel like my interview was just a technicality. If there are other people/things you want to see on campus, I would speak up! x2 ","Ugh. The wait. The wait after an interview but before a decision. It's interminable. I so very much want this job, have reason to think the interview went very well, but also have reason to think that another candidate is likely to be offered the position. And I'm supposed to be getting other work done? 2) My strategy: convince yourself you have already been rejected and move on. No possibility for disappointment later (maybe even a pleasant surprise), and helps with getting things done in the mean time. May not work for everyone though. 3) I think this is wise, though it can be hard to squash that sliver of hope that maybe, just maybe, they want you as much as you want them. 4) I was in the same boat last week. Counting the days after the decision timeline that they gave me, 5 full days passed, 2 extra skype interviews, 1 campus interview and still I was just waiting for them to call. They did eventually. Maybe I was #2 but i still got it. Hope it works out for you too.  4) I only had one on-site. It has been 4 weeks after the last interview.  Havn't heard anything. I feel my chance is getting very very low. 5) WTF do SCs think gives them the right to just keep candidates in the dark for such a long time after their interviews ended and an offer has been made?! Like, at least a brief email saying that an offer has been made but not finalized would be trivial to send out.  6) I am #4, I just send out an email to the SC chair. I am ready to hear bad news. OP) I had an interview in October and then radio silence until I finally heard back in February that I hadn't gotten the job. I had figured it out on my own by then. I think they wanted to wait until the offer was finalized, but even if it had fallen through and I was second in line, I would have known I wasn't first choice. I'm with you #5, I wish committees would just give out a little more info. 7) @ #6 How did contacting them go? Any advice from others on this strategy? I am usually told not to contact them just to ask what is happening.8) I am in the same boat. Really really wanted that job. it is now 2 weeks and no news. This is so grueling. 9) My app for my dream job was being considered further (email interest check, ranking the interested candidates by committee action, getting invites approved by admin, and then bringing them out) and I'm trying to not get too anxious about the situation. The fact I've gotten this far is pretty damn cool since I threw this app at them in a hurry because I lost my job due to corporate shenanigans, but still it would make getting terminated all the better if I got to go do the job I've wanted since I was 15.  10) @#7, I was #6. I asked for an update from the search chair. He replied within one hour: the offer has been given to another candidate and the negociation is progress. He said I would remain on the shortlist until the offer is accepted. This is not a definitive rejection. But I took as a rejection. Now I need to figure something else out.","What does research look like at teaching-focused institution? I did my undergraduate, PhD, and (current) post-doc at R2 schools. PIs with labs consisting of grad students, a postdoc or two, and a handful of undergrads, all working to get pubs in moderate to high impact journals is just ""normal"" for me. I enjoyed teaching and undergrad mentorship and am looking at some positions in smaller, more teaching-focused schools (often undergrad-only programs). The job listings still say things like ""active research program with undergraduates"" and departmental websites often emphasis ""undergraduate research experiences"". However, often faculty haven't published in years (or decades). Even more recent faculty appear to have pubs end with what looks like their last dissertation chapter. i) Do faculty actually have something like a research ""program"" or is undergraduate research mentorship more on a case-by-base basis? ii) Is involvement in research/research mentorship actually a subsantive portion of their jobs? iii) What are the metrics of ""success"" when you don't have peer-reviewed publication? Without research websites/publications/presentation abstracts the research ""programs"" of these faculty are just really opaque to me. Sorry for the long query, but I'd be interested in your experiences. 2) Very good question! I don't have an answer but I am also looking at teaching focused postions that emphasize ""undergraduate research experience"". My naive opinion based on a few observations is that it is program and individual specific. Undergraduates can get research experience at a lot of different levels. Ideally they would have their own research project that you would mentor but they have lots of other responsibilities with classes and this might not always the best option for them. They could also contibute to some aspect of your research and present the project at a conference and ideally would receive co-authorship of a publicaiton if it is warranted. I have seen recent individuals do significant research at a teaching focused institution but much of their active research occurs in the summer. My plan going forward is that the summers will be devoted to research and matinain collaborations within and across departments/institutions to work on larger projects. I think large NSF grants are out of the question, at least as the lead PI? I anticipate working on smaller research projects funded locally by state agencies and non-profits. This probably doesn't answer your question and I am looking forward to others responses. 3) If you are at a true teachin school (3/4, 4/4 load or higher) you don't really do it, unless you have a burning desire. Your tenure is based on teaching only, and attendance at conferences is usually the research expectation. If they expect more, you're set up for failure.  4) I had an interview at an R2 that was teaching heavy but expected undergraduate and master's level research. My impression was the expectations are much lower, most of the research you do is carried out during the summer months when you don't have classes to worry about. Students in the lab work all semester, so things still carry on but less intensely while they are in classes. The type of research you do needs to be tailored towards undergraduates, i.e. patch clamping is not an appropriate approach to your research since most undergrads won't have the time in the lab to become proficient at it. Paper expectations were about 1 per year, with less regard to where you publish (around mid-tier) and funding expectations were that you would attempt to get outside grants but your tenure didn't depend on your ability to get grants. All in all, it was something I was very much interested in as I enjoy teaching and don't care for the pressure of my job depending on my ability to procure an R01 and other grants. 5) Realy glad to see this topic of conversation! I started this past fall at a public liberal arts campus, and have managed to stay productive so far (2/2 teaching load--this includes labs--1 pub out so far this year and 3 more currently in review, two of which are FA). True of my colleagues here as well, the key is GOOD COLLABORATORS adn staying plugged in to discipline-specific networks that keep you relevant. Best of luck! Some (many? most?) days I feel buried and overwhelmed, but have been overall happy with the balance I've struck. 6) My experience with elite lib arts colleges is that faculty have low teaching loads and many have NSF grants and active resarch programs. Different story at different types of teaching institutions where faculty are teaching 3-4 courses a semester. Agree that good collaborators are key 7) just to reiterate what the last couple posters said - there are SLACs and PUIs where faculty can be (and are!) extremely research-active with NSF and NIH grants.  A uni that touts undergrad research generally has expectations that faculty publish regularly and that students are a key part of the science.  Finally, to OP - do not trust information on pubs/grants/talks posted on departmental websites as these can be updated very infrequently.  Look the people in the department up on Google scholar /researchgate or their personal websites to get a better sense of how active they are.","I was contacted by a faculty member that was not involved in the hiring committee for a job to which I recently applied (and whom I have met at conferences, but do not know well). It said: ""So I heard you were runner up for that job recently. What's the story - did they offer it to you in the end?"" Who says that? Seems to be trying to make me feel bad regardless. Such a power move. 2) Maybe he thinks that you are better friends than you really are? 3) Seems to me that they were just interested. My default would be to give them the benefit of the doubt - akward, perhaps, but lots of academics are. x4 4) Acadmics are desperate to assert authority over their percieved domain... even if they weren't directly involved in the hiring committee, he/she is clearly trying to weigh in by pressing you about it. I'd tell them it's none of their business.  5) Geez, @4, don't be so cynical.  Maybe they're in another department and were rooting for you, but never heard the outcome through their colleagues. 6) Yeah I agree with 3 & 5 at least based on the little information given here. I've had several interactions with faculty from departments or search committees where I did not get the job that were super awkward in a similar way, but I think were more like attempts at offering condolences/acknowledgment of what happened rather than just walking away without saying anything (which is also complained about on this venting tab). 7) I agree with #6, and this is much better than the more typical ghosting. Faculty are also nosy by nature, so this fits with that...   8) We literally had a candidate who was interviewed, then not contacted yes/no.  The reason is that the search chair told us all at faculty meeting she already had accepted a job elsewhere.  This was in fact not true in any way.  But several of us walked in pushing to at least discuss her as someone that had to be on the list of potential hires, whether at the top or not.  The search failed, we ghosted her, and our school lost the chance to land a really really great PI.  I still don't know if the search chair had bad info from someone he trusted or if he sabotaged her on purpose in order to push for his choice.   By the time I had full info it was beyond too late to hire her so all I could do is apologize for how she was treated.  I imagine that faculty member is trying to fact check and do something if you were not contacted in the end.  There is a chance they well on your side, though you will have to judge based on your interactions with them.   It also sounds like they are trying to tell you that you should have been notified, so if it was very recent (still open posisition) then write the search chair to ask for an update on your status. 9) Call me naive, but if you assume the best intentions with regard to situations like this, you'll probably be correct and better served in more instances. 10) The simple truth is that @1 felt bad after this email regardless of the reason, whether @4 or @3 + 5 is right, it doesn't matter. That behavior is wrong because it made @1 feel terrible (they probably didn't get the job and so felt bad when someone pried about it so directly). 11) Completely agree with #3 and #9. A couple of these opinions are wierd.   Speaking as a faculty member-- there's a lot we're not told (and should have been), such as-- position X has been filled by person Y.  I would take the message to mean, this faculty member hoped #1 would be offered the job, didn't know if they had been, and asked the source directly. Although tone may be off (remember how hard it is to read tone in email), I highly doubt they were trying to make the poster feel bad. The intent is to know whether they were offered the job in the end. 12) OP here. Thanks for your thoughts and reminding me to think the best of others! I am in a very small field, so I was concerned about others knowing about my attempt to find a new position, as I I want to leave my current one. In the end, I told the person that I appreciated their interest, and that I would be happy to speak with them once I had sorted out my next move. He confronted me at a conference last week about it with the same question, in front of my current colleagues. This small field is very gossipy, which I find very difficult to manage. My nightmare is something like what 8 described in terms of people gossiping and making assumptions about others. 13) Whether just a clueless academic or worse, it's incredibly lame of this person to have asked you about the job in front of other colleagues. x3 14) This is amazing.  The faculty member who sent this e-mail was being friendly, and expressing their hope that the person had eventually received an offer there (and some things you can read into the message, since that seems to be the goal of most of the discussion, like ""how are you doing?  did you end up somewhere else?"" etc.) It's so completely obvious that they are being friendly that it is painful to read the misinterpretation. Here is an analogy, available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAYL5H46QnQ. The faculty member here is the hot dog vendor. The lunatics who think this is about power are Andy Samberg. 15) Hey, 14, come on. You don't know any more about this situation than the rest of us who have read this thread. That doesn't make you qualified to make pronouncements about absolutes. I think the faculty member's comments are probably harmless, but that's the best certainty level any of us can give.","Retracting signed offer I received an offer for a position but am waiting for a finalist interview for an industry job. The current position is a salary that's on the lower end, while the industry one would likely be higher. Already negotiated to the top of what they;d offer. Yes, I'm aware that salary is only 1 piece of the considerations for a job, but let's assume all other factors are equal. Are there repercussions of signing an offer and retracting it a month or so later if something better comes up? How frequently does this happen? 2) I wouldn't feel too bad retracting a signed offer if I were going into industry. 3) I understand it's your life and you need to do what is best for you but going back on a signed offer is not a professional thing to do. 4) @3, define ""professional"" 5) It is totally fine. Just make sure you didn't have any penalty clauses in your contract (there rarely are in academic contracts). The only hard part is breaking the news, but I am sure you will be as professional as possible. Go on to make more money and probably be much happier. Congrats! 6) Completely agree with 5. If the way we as job seekers are treated is the measure of professionalism, OP is well ahead of the game. 7) Both @3 and everyone else are right. It's not professional, and is a shitty thing to do, but it's also the rest of your life, so just do it unless there are actual legal repercussions, which is extremely unlikely. It'll be an awkward call, but then it'll be over with. This happens all the time. 8) I think I'd secretly relish rescinding an offer from a university (if I had something better lined up, of course). They do it to us, on occasion, without any real consequences and for once, it'd be fun to wield that power in the other direction. 9) Do what's best for you. The School that offerrd you is and will always do whats best for THEM. Act in your own best interests, and good luck OP! 10) Don't plan on ever going back academia (in the US) if this is your move. Word will get around. 11) I don't think this is true. I seriously doubt other schools will know or care. I got a TT offer last year after someone pulled out of the contract when they found out they recieved a prestigious fellowship. I turned down the job, and they ended up hiring someone else. The person that got the fellowship and pulled out ended up getting a job at a top 10 SLAC this year. Don't buy in to the cult mentality. It's a job. There are thousands of qualified people to do it. 12) You should always feel free to put your well-being (and potentially that of your spouse/family/dog/etc.) at the top of the list. If that's the case in your situation, you'll have the support of many people here. 13) @11 I think people would be more forgiving towards a fellowship (and becoming a better trained sceintists) than taking an industrial job ($). There's certainly many more applicants out there, but once someone says ""yes"" and signs the contract the search is closed and I think in mnay cases is very hard to reopen. Lots of people put in work on the search that is now failed. 14) @13 How incredibly absurd to asume that science isnt done in industry, and it's only about money. Please dont pretend that money isnt a concern for parties in academia as well. x2 15) ""professionalism"" aside, my understanding is that a signed academic employment offer is not a legally-binding contract on the employee, it just represents the employee stating that they in good faith intend to enter into employment under the terms outlined. Clearly things happen that change circumstances in the time before employment actually starts. The other side of that, the academic employer, is generally considered to be at least somewhat legally bound to execute the agreement, and when offers are rescinded after signed letters there are typically financial settlements. Lastly, I'll add that this should also be looked at in the context of situations where one takes the job and then leaves soon after for other employment/a better offer. It seems we don't generally think that is ""unprofessional"", but it actually may represent a greater financial loss to the institution (lost salary, start-up, moving costs before you had much output) than if you just never showed up to work in the first place. 16) @14 The OP said it was about $. 17) OP here. Thanks for the input. Accepted the offer. found out the industry job has much worse benefits, which doesnt make me feel as bad about my position. ","I just feel so tired. It's my first year on the job market and I barely had any response to my apps. Are these academic careers worth it? Part of me wants to get a federal job, but they are hard to get too and I'm worried I'll get bored. 2) Ditto.3) Whether these academic jobs are worth it or not is subjective and you will need to figure that out on your own, but if you are interested in general feedback and not just venting frustration, the truth is that most of us were completely unsuccessful our first year or two on the market (few to no interviews). I would try and view this as a learning experience, as you hopefully have learned how long it tooks to put together a job packet and, more importantly, can view your own packet objectively to see where you feel your own weakness lie, which you can try and minimize over the next year. As you mentioned, there are other career pathways available, and keeping an open mind is always healthy. Best of luck in the future. 4) @3, thank you! I am feeling very discouraged and your perspective helped a lot. 5.) If this offers any perspective, this is my 2nd year applying, I have had zero responses so far and I have filled out 20+ applications. I applied for 50+ last year and quickly learned what type of job I wanted (3 on-campus interviews at liberal arts/R2 unis). It is discouraging, and if you're anything like me, you will want to give up constantly. I agree with @3, try to be objective about your application package and have as many people read it as possible. I thought my application materials were better this year and got less bites *shrugs*. All I can say is keep trying, I'm going into my 5th year in postdoc, so I don't have a lot of answers myself. I'm not sure of your exact focus, but also look into state jobs as well, I know many in wildlife and field ecology that got state jobs instead of academia. You never know, really as I have come to put it, just keep trudging. I don't know when my breaking point is, but I wish you luck. 6) @5 thank you! I hope you get your dream job. 7) @1 This job game is a rollercoaster. My first year I had 1 video, and 1 on-campus interview. Year 2 - absolutely nothing! Year 3 - 6 video, 3 on-campus (despite no massive changes in CV). Just keep at it if it's something you want! It doesn't make much sense :) 8) I feel you. The academic job market is awful and takes a ton of energy. If it's of any help, last January I was feeling super tired and unmotivated because I submitted over 30 applications, got 2 phone interviews and zero on-campus interviews; this January I'm feeling so much better and excited - I submitted 12 applications, got 6 phone interviews, 4 on-campus, and so far 1 job offer (top choice!). It's a roller coaster and it's up to you to decide if it's worth it. Best of luck! 9) @8 wow! I love hearing stories like yours. Congratulations!","Forms temporarily down Sorry about that!  2) OK, we're back."

It's getting to the point where I don't even want to use this site anymore.  Who deleted the UT-Tyler Microbiologist search from the Vacanies page and why?  Is there an Ecology/Evolution Nazi deleting anything they deem not Ecology and Evolution enough?  Many of us ecology and evolutionary researchers/teachers have the abilities to teach things like developmental biology, genetics, microbiology, anatomy & physiology, etc., so I think if someone takes the time to enter the vacany information, just leave it the fuck alone.  Someone has just way too much spare time on their hands to be editing the postings here.  I've had entire conservations disapper for no apparent reason.  Touch not lest ye be touched!

I personally think wearing no suit is always better than a suit which looks silly. Any thoughts?  2)  how about for interviewing when very obviously 7 months pregnant? 3) I'd say it depends on where in the country you're interviewing -- some areas (Northeast) might be more formal than others (West).  When I've interviewed, I've worn business casual (nice Banana republic pants and a stylish top -- all in neutral colors)  4) I've been wearing a suit jacket that is a different color from my pants on the seminar day and nice pants/top on the second day, both with low heels.  I debated a long time about the suit jacket though... 5) I think combining nice pants with a suit jacket is best choice, but it's hard finding a good match. 6) In ecology, I would not wear a suit. For my interviews I wore a nice gray businessy dress with black tights, a nice black sweater, and nice boots. One interview involved a second day, and for that I wore nice black slacks and a nice new sweater. Got an offer (and compliments on my outfit!) so I guess it worked. :) ","Yeah, some admin straight up asked me if i was married. Not the search committee but maybe the person giving the HR speech should effing know not to ask that???","Letters of recommendation late Does anyone know if letters of recommendation that arrive after the deadline are still considrered? Is the application without all letters considered incomplete and automatically rejected? Some of my references are notoriously late with their letters despite me sending them reminder emails (it's infuriating actually). I haven't gotten any interest in my application this year despite being a perfect fit for several positions and I'm wondering if the fact that the letters were submitted after the deadline might have been part of the reason. 3) My 2 cents (4 search committees over the years). Letters don't really matter unless they are bad. Most letters say, ""So and so is great"", so they don't add anything. There were instances when letters were less than glowing, which was useful. Unless committees are under some extreme deadline, then it takes a couple weeks for everyone to go through the application packets and find a good time to meet (between classes, mentoring, running a lab, etc.). People wonder why it sometimes take months to run a search. So if your letters got there within a week or so of the deadline you're probably fine. Seems to be a really competitive year for some positions (hello Notre Dame) but our school only got about 20 applications for one position. 4) Veteran of many searches here.  We're not looking to ""thin the pool"", we're looking for the best candidate to join our department.  In my experience, if your application is very appealing, we will either tell you that you're missing letters & to have them sent, ask the letter writers ourselves, or overlook one missing letter (if not from your advisor).  I agree with #3, letters are usually not very informative anyhow.  5) I got multiple ""one letter is missing"" messages and the long-list stage.  I think it would be bad to have all 3 missing, but they know people are submitting dozens of letters each term.  It's less damaging than missing letters for fellowships or grad school apps. OP) Thanks all! This makes me feel a little better.6) Different universities are different about these rules.  Mine has a rule, if the letters are not in by the time the dean approves the short list, the person is disqualified.  It ALSO has a rule, you cannot email single candidates reminders, apparently that's unfair somehow.  So everyone gets spammed with a reminder to ensure letters even though there's only one person who needs to do this. And... we are about to drop someone from our short list for this reason (!!!) 7) Yup - some searchers will drop you for a lack of letters - let your references know this. I've struggled with this as 2 of my 3 main letter writers are bad about getting letters in.","Why do I still feel the need to check wiki on x-mas eve/Hanukkah?! 2) Because you might find out anything at any time! I just got invited for a phone interview today on Xmas eve... 3) I just got a rejection email after an on-campus interview on christmas eve, as I was getting ready to go to a family xmas party. That SUCKED 4) That's horrible, sorry :( you should add it to the faculty jobs update so we know who these terrible people are.5) Yes. Last year I got a rejection on Xmas eve too. 6) I think getting any email about a job on Christmas Eve has an Ebenezer Scrooge flair to it. 7) @6 I don't know - I got an interview request on Xmas Eve and thought it a nice Christmas present. Rejections would not be, though. People trying to clear their desks before Christmas and just not thinking about the recipient! 8) It means if you have a job at that university, you'll be expected to take care of service during holidays. Research and writing during holidays, fine, but university service, absolutely no in my book (speaking as a current tenure track position holder) because it's one of the few 'vacations' we get. 9) @8 Given the flexibility of our jobs, a little work over break to advance your department is not a big deal. 10) Unpaid work is unpaid work. 11) Arguments like #9 is why we work 12 months but only get paid for 9, which is a big deal if you're in a department that demands service but doesn't reward it when it comes to raises or tenure. 9 again) You know that faculty are salaried employees? And at my university, the university is open during most of winter break. So, just because class isn't in session doesn't mean you're not being paid to work. Summer is a different issue of course! But my main point is, it's not the ""evil university"" forcing extra work out of you: taking care of searches contributes to the success of your department, your colleagues, and yourself. 12) we can argue back and forth about unpaid work and expectations for low pay--and it's sad that your university is open over the holiday because evidently they really do expect you to work over the break-- but it would end up being something like a Union vs. Trump fight anyway. Nice to know that some academics have bought into the corporate nonsense and are doing their best in undermining the workplace.Good luck in chasing your carrots. 13) If you can't take care of contributing to the success of the department during normal working hours (my institution is closed for 12 days in December), something's not running efficiently. In some places, searches get dealt with in a matter of days and they manage to make good picks. 14) Yep, that's right. I'm the one who made the Scrooge and Trump references - my point is that if you get an email about a service related topic (search committee results) on a holiday, it could be that the search chair/department/university is overworked or poorly organized, which is something to consider during an interview (or be happy you didnt get one). 15) Hmm. I received my 1st contact email from a school on Xmas Eve, follow-up sent at 10p.m. on New Year's Day. Maybe that is not such a great sign. 16) You are doomed! 17) I work on holidays because I *love* my job, and I think it's ridiculous to assert that search committees and chairs who contact you on holidays are indicative of a problematic department or disorganized person. It's a privilege to be a scientist -- grad student, postdoc, faculty member, whatever -- and I don't get hung up on whether or not I'm ""being paid"" for a particular unit of time on a particular day. In my experience, academia isn't an hourly-wage-timecard-in-timecard-out kind of career. Can this make setting work/life balance boundaries tricky? Sure. But that's on us as individuals, not on a university or a department. 18) The problem is that when enough people work on holidays becaus they *love* their job it is easy for that to become the norm and expectation. At some point it becomes hard for people who want to work for the hours that they are paid and have a health work/life balance to be as productive. I'm not saying people should be disallowed from working holidays, but the idea that this is all a personal problem and not a university or department level problem is ridiculous wishful thinking, imo. Many people don't have the ability to work those hours (putting aside the desire to do it). For example, people with young kids (especially women), family responsibilities, etc. If those people aren't as productive or aren't seen as *team players* because they don't help with service over holidays when no childcare is available that contributes to reduced diversity in faculty composition. In short, just because the expectation of working holidays doesn't affect you personally doesn't mean it isn't a problem (and note that I say this as someone who has worked on plenty of holidays myself...). 19) It's not even about productivity but the expectation to be visible 60 hours a week or more - if you're not, you're clearly not sufficiently committed according to some. Meanwhile, I know plenty of high profile people who don't work much more than a regular old 40-hour week. IMO work whenever you want, but don't shove it in other people's faces. 20) Agree with the general feeling of this thread. For example, I don't think many SC chairs/members realize the negative signal sending important career messages on standard holidays sends to aspiring faculty members. And beyond messaging, it is just inconsiderate. Love your job all you want, but do the lovin' by yourself! 21) I suspect that some SC members secretly delight in sending a rejection email on Christmas Eve. 22) I'd wager that the people sending emails on holidays or at night have probably at least one divorce in their past. 22) Is part of the issue here people tending to notice the emails they get outside of normal work hours, and not notice all the ones they *don't* get outside of normal work hours? To take an analogous example, if you see one prof in your department working late every night, do you notice that and feel pressured to do the same? And do you also notice the large majority of profs who *aren't* at work because they went home at the usual time? 23) Agreed #22. And when you get that weekend email from me, you probably don't notice the email I didn't send during ""working hours"" because I was taking my kid to a school event or because it was great weather and I went for a bike ride instead. 24) Unless that email is urgent, save the draft until morning or Monday if you're in a position of power relative to the recipient. That includes search committees. 25) If you're so adamant about it, just don't check your email until Monday morning. It'll be waiting for you. 26) It's pretty shocking how blindly many academics have assumed an apologetic, predatory, mentality/psychology here and don't get it or really want to. If your chair/dean/supervisor or boss writes you on a weekend or after hours, they may well expect an answer. Perception of being a team player is crucial to getting promoted or tenure. Frankly, it's egotistic if you want to take a bike ride on a nice weekday afternoon but then write emails at your convenience AND either expect an answer over the weekend OR you've pushed work off until the next week. Great example how selfishness leads to abuse and inefficiency.

This is the fee that most universities pay to have an H1B application processed within 15days. The wait time is ""3 to 6 months"" without premium processing but this will undoubtedly become longer. http://www.cnn.com/2017/03/04/us/h1b-visa-premium-processing-suspended/  - at my university, they indicate they will not be able to process hires in time for a fall start unless those applications are submitted within the next 2 weeks. 1) Yikes! OP) Apparently actual wait times without premium processing are currently closer to 9 months (according to my university) 2) my previous experience is 3-4 months  2) My uni says only J visas for pdocs right now b/c more likely to be approved.

It was subsequently changed after the DoS issued an advisory opinion, having been assured that I do not directly receive government funding, i.e. I am not named in a grant.

If you have a trusted mentor, you might be able to get information on why you're the bridesmaid and not the bride (could be easy to fix). Also, if you're regularly short-listed it's just a matter of time before you get an offer unless you're falling onto the ""not viable"" list for some reason 8) oh just a matter of time? great I'll pay my bills with ious. six Interviews, no offers, post doc funding ran out 22 days ago. I wish I had time for it to matter 9) uff. I'd say give up on academia and look into a non-academic career, but if you had SIX on campus interviews, you're clearly competitve and doing something right, so giving up seems premature. However, I understand the reality of having to pay bills and not live in a box on the street. 10) Lolz #5 x4 11) I also have many campus interviews without offers.  If each place interviews 4-6 people the probability that you're not picked each time is still pretty high :( 11) My postdoc funding ran out 8mo ago.

After you signed the offer letter or after you’ve been through the credit (i meant background) checks and degree verification, etc.? I feel like many of my colleagues have been really hush hush about it and I am wondering if I need to be that way as well. I start in a few months and want to get students/lab members and let other colleagues know, but don’t want to commit any faux pas due to my nativity. 2) Wondering this too. Ive signed my offer letter, waiting on the next steps. My friends, family and immediate colleagues know, but that's it. 
3)  Seems like the appropriate thing to do is to tell folks you currently work with as soon as you know, so they can start planning on what to do to replace you, but if they've treated you like shit and that's the reason you are leaving, I suppose you can take the low road and just give them two weeks notice.  ;)  Regardless, be sure to update the Faculty Jobs tab, so other folks that applied for the job know it's filled, so they can stop stressing.  We won't know who you are until where you are going updates their website in the Fall and by then, who cares. 4) Credit checks?  ""Sorry, we'll have to revoke this offer, your FICO score is too low.""  When did this become a thing? 5) Wait, what now? I had no idea any of this was a thing. I've recently received a verbal offer, so should probably figure this out. Once I sign the full offer letter, there is still more to be done? A degree verification? Credit check?? Is there anything else on the horizon that I should be aware might happen? Does this ever actually derail a hire? 6) so sorry, #1 here - I meant background checks, not credit checks ;p I have definitely notified my employer etc. and faculy job tab was already updated. I just meant more of when I can start notifying folks on social media sites and start advertising for students. I don't want to do it prematurely and piss off the department or whatever. I just want to get a start on getting a student asap. 7) I don't know what is considered acceptable or common, but you could email the department chair and get their input? 8) I waited until they had confirmed receipt of my signed offer letter. The department head also sent an email to the department announcing my acceptance of the position and welcoming me. I felt like that was a green light to announce it publicallyx2.","The elusive ""Short List."" What the heck does that even mean? What it means is that, ""we like you...we are putting you on this list--we say we will contact you very soon....and then we will never contact you again and you'll learn the position was filled via word of mouth."" Cool. 2) I picture your description more as the ""long"" list (i.e. you are good but not as good as several other candidates so we won't tell you you're out but we also won't tell you you are in until). The short list is the list of 5-10 people they will invite for phone interviews but with a top 2-4 already in the lead for an on-campus interview before the phone interviews are even conducted. It is very hard to crack the on-campus invite list if you are the last one on the short list. - I also think you mean ""elusive"" 3) OP--I do mean elusive. Yes. Thank you. I'm changing it. I guess it's less sexy to say in an e-mail, ""You're on the long list."" 4) I've been told for one position this cycle I'm on the long list; they've not yet generated the short list.  I appreciate knowing that, though I realize there are others who would rather only hear if they make the short list.  I've certainly vented about some things myself as an applicant, but I find it's helpful to my emotional stability to realize that the search committees can be in a tough spot too -- the things some candidates would want are things other candidates would definitely not want. 5) Agree with @4: I've received exactly one notification implying that I was long-listed (place informing me it had received recs, after not requiring them with the application), and that's out of over two dozen applications. It was also almost 4 months ago, so I probably didn't get further than the long-list, but it still helps to know that my application didn't just get tossed in the bin.","questions for junior faculty at an institution If you had the opportunity to chat with other recently hired junior faculty in a department to which you've applied, what kinds of questions would be useful to ask them? 2) What is different in reality from what your expectations were?

I've heard conflicting things, and our university has indicated that ""universities are currently ineligible to receive funds through this program"". Our work was funded by a provincial grant, and since we are barred from doing the work we can't fulfill the deliverables and I'm out financial support for the summer. 2) Great question, and interested to know the answer. My funding body has said they will not provide extensions, but they are happy to pause our payments so we can claim CERB in the meantime and get an overall longer postdoc. This response is extremely unsatisfying on a number of levels, but not being sure whether we are even eligible is a kind of central one. 3) I have been looking into this, and as #2 alludes to the website indicated that ""You must have stopped working as a result of COVID-19 and be without employment income for at least 14 consecutive days within the initial four-week period. This includes income from paid leave, self-employment income or collection of any Employment Insurance benefits."" https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/ei/cerb-application.htm . So if you still have money coming in that will factor into your eligiblity. Postdocs are or are not considered employees in Canada depending on various factors including where the funding comes from: https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/canada-pension-plan-cpp-employment-insurance-ei-rulings/cpp-ei-explained/canada-pension-plan-employment-insurance-explained-4.html Generally speaking postdoc salary appears not to be eligible for EI. This leaves only the CERB as an option, but again to be eligible must have stopped working and you can't be receiving income. This puts us in a really hard place. I hope everying works out #2!"
"Was my interview that bad? Just found out that a position I interviewed for decided to hire no one rather than hire me.  They made an offer to another candidate, things didn't work out, they decided to leave it unfilled.  Thing is, I thought the interview was great and I would have taken the job in a heartbeat.  Ouch! 1) I was a grad student in a department that went through more than one search from which no one was hired. Candidates were good, but a divided faculty couldn't agree on anyone. So don't take it too personally! 2) I've also heard of situations where the SC pulled out all the stops to recruit the first candidate (met high negotiation demands etc.) and in so doing had to argue to the dean that this really was the only person they could hire for the position. Even though they would have been happy to have one of the other candidates, having made the argument to the higher ups, they couldn't offer to the 2nd in line. Very lame, but not a reflection on the other candidates. Sucks, though, hang in there!

Any thoughts or news? 1) My guess is that the 1 semester position is a stop-gap for the failed chair position to fill teaching needs, or it's a sabatical replacement.

Phone interviews are the worst. 3) What happened in the bombed phone interview?? 4) OP to #3: Mostly I felt that I was not very cohesive and articulate in my answers. In some cases I felt I didn’t answer the question completely and ended my responses abruptly. I was trying to come up with more specific examples to illustrate my answers and couldn’t so had to end my responses sort of awkwardly. I don’t think it was a complete train wreck but certainly don’t have a good feel about it. 5) Just move on. Most people here aren't getting phone interviews so take it in stride and do better next time. 6) I had my first skype interview last year for an R1 position (fresh out of my PhD); things didn't go terrible but not great either.  I ultimately didn't get a campus interview but I am so much more prepared for my next phone interview.  You'll get your dream job someday OP.. I wouldn't worry about this flub :)  (x2) 7) There's always at least one interaction at any interview stage that you keep playing back over and over -- best advice I got was to do something mind-numbing to stop thinking about it. Chances are, the people on the receiving end of the interaction didn't think it was nearly as terrible as your auto-replay suggests! :) 8) Know how you feel- I told a committe in Ohio that it would be cool to get to vote early in the presidential primaries, and then the next day I realized that it's Iowa, not Ohio, that has an early presidential primary. 9) All those states in the midwest are the same anyways ;) 10) OP - Thank you all for sharing your experiences. Next time I will be more prepared!","27)  Of course it's mean to send a rejection email on Christmas Eve - and you expect people to thank you? I know tons of people in this field, tons of really successful ones, too, and they've never had the attitude to do something like that. No need for that here. 28) It would not cross my mind that sending a job rejection on Christmas Eve is pathological or predatory(?) or selfish.  I would think a) I'm getting my work done before taking a break b) People want to know about their application status as soon as reasonable possible, c) I've worked in labs that were primarily composed of people who were not Christian.  Half of them would work on Christmas Day (but not New Year's Day). This IS a competitive business and it does require >40 hours/week to get ahead. 29) Of course ""I left this until the last minute"" says ""We're well organized around here"". (x2) 30) I'm amazed at how many people, like #28 here, are convinced by the logic: ""This wouldn't bother me, therefore it is OK."" 31) It's a great example how corrupt as a society we've become, when norms start being infringed upon and a good portion of people respond with 'well, that's ok, it doesn't bother or impact me'. It's the slow boil of a frog in a pot.  I really worry about NSF and NIH funding in the coming years, but objectively speaking, I think we really have deserved someone like Trump because far too many academics, faculty, postdocs and phd students haven't been involved in any political process and have such unrealistic views, unable/unwilling to see beyond their own issues or accept political systems and realities for what they are. Things will only change when people have had enough, reading this thread basically tells me that we aren't there yet. 28) again.  I'm on my second year on TT and that's based on my experience and those of my peers.  It might not be what you (or I) like but I am grateful to have a job doing what I love. I am trying to understand why this would be so distressing to you - is it getting a job rejection on Christmas Eve or working >40 hours/week?  If it's the latter, maybe academia is not a good fit for you. 32) And people wonder why there's a diversity problem. Having other responsibilities that might limit hours has already been mentioned in this thread. Incidentally, my abusive ex-boss used to talk about about gratitude and being privileged to be allowed to do science (I was ""privileged"" enough to have my work stolen by him and get nothing in return). 31) 28 reads complaints about sending rejection letters on Christmas Eve, then pivots to suggest the whole problem is people not liking  to work >40 hours a week. That kind of ability to insult someone out of nowhere will get you a nice gig in the Trump administration, but it has no place here. x3. 32) Baffles me that people are so negative about when people are working. Look at it from another perspective; should someone work <40 hrs a week just b/c you work under 40 hrs a week, so it's all fair? Why should we be judged on the hours or days we work? Some people work more...some people work less. Some people work on holidays...some people don't. Why don't you all just worry about yourself? There's weeks where I put in 60+ hrs and weeks where I put in <5 hrs. I don't get all bent out of shape when I'm taking it easy on my slow weeks and a colleague of mine is in the lab. Also, my spouse works or is on call most holidays. Therefore, we have our family holidays on ""off days."" Because of this, I tend to work the holidays. This is the nice thing about academia and living in a free country; you can decide when you want to work! If someone gets ahead of you b/c they work more hours than you, that's just life. Why should that person not get ahead just so you don't look worse in comparison? Just remember, someone has to work at Community College U, and if you are so concerned about others getting ahead b/c they sacrificed other endeavors in their lives (e.g., having kids, going on vacations, spending time with family, etc...), that person might just be you. 33) Most of us do work >>40hrs/week because we need to in order to compete. That's a problem for a few reasons: a) it reduces diversity. Not everyone can prioritise work to that degree. b) It messes up home lives and mental health. Lots of academic women don't have kids because they know that care responsibilities come with a career penalty. Lots of successful academic men have wives who take on the lion's share of work at home; c) we are seriously undervaluing/underpricing our work: one recent study found that >30% of research is done for free, by academics and researchers working unpaid overtime 34) ""Why don't you all just worry about yourself?"". Because I'm not a narcissist who doesn't care about diversity and not excluding groups of people from science. You also might want to actually read the thread, as people were explicitly saying they don't care about your hours, but an email sent at the wrong time might well send negative signals. Good luck working as much as you want if your superior thinks otherwise, btw. 35) Clearly some of us are not ready to be a faculty member. #28’s words are a bit harsh, but he/she is right that if you are on the job market and have a problem that OTHER faculty members work on the holidays, then maybe academia is not a good fit for you. One of the benefits of being a faculty member is that you can decide when to work. 36) Read the thread. Maybe if you're lacking in empathy, a position where you have substantial power over trainees isn't a good fit for you. 37) Yes, read the thread. If you were a faculty member, you'd realize that you don't really get to decide when you work, unless you are tenured full professor and a complete ass toward everyone around you, and even the Dean, Provost or President cowers before you. 38) So let me get this straight, everyone is upset b/c if an administrator emails you on a holiday, and you don't respond, someone else might and that would make you look bad. Thus, you have to be on call 24 hrs a day, 365 days a year in order to not look bad. The fact that the administrator emailed you on the holiday therefore creates an expectation that everyone must constantly be on call. Thus, the only way to succeed in academia is to be constantly on call and because of this the administrator is effectively eliminating a diverse faculty (e.g., faculty members with kids). Is that what I'm hearing? If that is your thought process when you receive an email from a superior over the weekend, you probably need to get a prescription for xanax. 39) <- you're just being rude, not productive or informative. (x3).  40) Yes, you do have to be on call. I get emails at night and on weekends from deans and chairs.Promotions are dependent on 'collegiality'. 41) To 39, less productive than coming up with conspiracy theories about universities based on emails received outside of ""normal"" office hours...or...typing responses on a wiki, when I should be planning on how to deal with all the emails I will receive over the weekend? True, in no way was that response supposed to be informative and neither is this one. To 40, first, get some xanax. Second, ""Promotions are dependent on 'collegiality,'"" is not at all a factual statement. Many universities use standardized quantitative approaches to assess tenure/promotion eligibility (""bean counting"") with no care in the world about 'collegiality.' Using your experiences to enlighten young people on what they might run into in academia is fine, but only if you provide the caveat, ""it's not like this everywhere and is just my experience."" 42) It would be nice to know the stage of career of the posters on this discussion.  43) #35 again. I read the whole thread. I feel sorry that #3 received an rejection letter on christmas eve (Got one rejection letter in one holiday one year too, and it sucked). I would never do that if I were in the search committee, because it’s a bit inconsiderate. But the search committee member or the staff who sent out the emails did nothing wrong — inconsiderate at most. Christmas Eve is not even a federal holiday. What I feel really odd is that some people are condemning others sending out emails in an ungodly hour, which is totally absurd. Of course most people don’t want to receive work related emails in the holidays, but it’s not other people’s problem. One need to either accept checking emails 24X7, or have a strong mind not checking emails in the nights or holidays. Sometimes it may make you look bad, but that’s life. And to be honest, if you want to have a life, at some point you need to force yourself not to check emails all the times. It’s ridiculous to ask other people saving draft in the mail box and only send out in the working hours. 1) Other people’s working hours are not your business. 2) A lot of people in academia work in their own hour routine, for example, a female faculty member might only work in the evening after kid(s) fall asleep, and a male faculty starts to work at 5 am so that he can take children to the after-school activities. 3) If one has colleagues living in another country or different coasts, your working hour is different with his/her working hour. x4 44) Food for thought: A large or reputable company would in most cases not send out critical HR notices outside of business hours, and honestly, neither should universities (which are often just as large or larger enterprises). The excuse that a small group of faculty serving on a search committee are somewhow immune or exempt from common business standards and standards of decency is ridiculous, and indeed an excuse. I offer that the feelings and experiences offered by numerous applicants in this thread should lay bare to SC chairs and members some important realities. And let's be honest, ""turning your phone off"" or ""stop checking your email"" is unrealistic and a lame end-around, blame-dumping on the applicant for what is simply poor workplace practice. Perhaps if you read this thread, it might influence your future timing of notices if/when the tables are turned. x2 45) I completely agree - conducting work involving others outside of typical work ours is a form of social/professional corruption.. Remember that the conventional 5 day/40 hour workweek was not given to society, it was earned and fought for. I think a lot of these readers should think about their actions and responses and those of their institution and look what's happening around us.  If you're a postdoc and working >40 hours a week, you may well have to to keep your job, but you shouldn't defend it. 46) I agree with #45 that conducting work involving others outside typical work hours is just unprofessional. To the SC member who sent a rejection letter on Christmas Eve, how would you like if you get a letter from the NSF/NIH on Christmas Eve saying your grant proposal is rejected? What goes around comes around. 46) Not defending sending rejection emails on Christmas Eve, but to the broader point about sending emails during ""non-work hours"", here is an interesting perspective: https://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2017/01/11/work-at-the-times-that-work-for-you/ (I think the key is: supervisors, talk to your students etc. and tell them that you do not expect them to respond instantly, & model work-life balance in other ways); please acknowledge that flexible hours can work FOR diversity & work-life balance, when e.g. it allows moms & dads to work around kids schedules. Finally, for hard-liners on this thread advocating that emailing outside of work hours is never okay - when you are working w/ a collaborator, journal review office, etc in another time zone, do you check the time stamp & do the conversion to decide whether to be outraged/pressured by the time it was sent? Seriously? OP here) holy moly! 47) I'll bite. Did you miss the part about power differentials and non-urgent messages? Some contracts explicitly have flextime written into them. Those count as normal hours in my book. My collaborators in other time zones very rarely email me outside of their core working hours. I know when those are, because I aim to get back to them before the end of their working day or before they start in the morning (but after they are likely to check messages). Go ahead and roll your eyes, but messages sent outside of those time windows are less likely to actually get a response. I work with Europeans who don't feel the need to martyr themselves. 48) Simple solution here? Email scheduling apps. SC chairs can schedule rejection emails to send for whenever they wish with these apps, Monday at 8 AM, Wed at high noon, Friday at 5 PM, pistols at dawn, or...xmas eve :) 49) In fact some of these behaviors may violate uni HR policies would b curious... 50) In fact, most of these behaviors are explicitly allowed by university HR policies. Here is Vanderbilt's policy for exempt employees: ""Exempt employees are also required to work any hours necessary to perform the duties of the job."" Here's one from Johns Hopkins: ""Exempt staff schedules are dependent upon job requirements and are the responsibility of the supervisors."" I guess the people here who don't like the fact that a supervisor can send emails over non-traditional work hours should not apply to Vanderbilt and Johns Hopkins, or pretty much any other university. It's hard for me to have much sympathy for people complaining about this when you are applying for a job as an exempt employee. You could always apply for a job in university food service and be protected under FLSA. Personally, I'd rather answer an email over the weekend. x2 52) thanks for bringing up policy, regulations and laws. 53) I am one of the first posters of this thread. I think people are confused and conflating between working as an exempt employee and getting rejections emails on Christmas Eve. MOST people here, and I will presume even all, will have no problems working on weekends on non-traditional work hours. That's what we did in our PhD and probably what we do in our postdocs if we want to get the coveted few academic positions there are. Let me repeat. Most people here has no problems working off non-traditional hours. BUT, seriously, when the deadline for a job search is October 1st and they invited people for on campus interviews in November, the SC has all the time in the world to send rejection emails but choose to send it on a Christmas eve when people are starting their holidays. A lot of people here have fellowships or contracts which are about to end and are hinging on positive news in the job market otherwise they will be unemployed, sent back to their home country or have no money to feed their family. And you, a SC member who has tenure and a stable job, have to choose Christmas eve to be a Scrooge to poor postdocs who are waiting for some positive news. Have you forgotten when you are a postdoc and in the job market? Being a professor does not exempt you from having some courtesy. Sorry for the long vent. Well, it is the venting tab anyway. Peace. 54) I was thinking it was an argument about universities demanding more and more service because fewer and fewer indirects are coming in and they are laying off staff members. 55)""Have you forgotten when you were a postdoc and in the job market?"" <-- Yes many have and that's why they say it's the best years of their lives! 55) ""A lot of people here have fellowships or contracts which are about to end and are hinging on positive news in the job market otherwise they will be unemployed, sent back to their home country or have no money to feed their family."" <-- It could be that some of us just don't understand this scenario. I never limited financial and personal stability to the academic job market. Worse case scenario, I was going back into a skilled laborer position at $50K a year if academia didn't pan out. I just don't understand the philosophy, in any career, to completely limit yourself to career option. Thus, I never considered a rejection letter bad news. A rejection letter was just news. 56) <- Congrats on not needing a work visa to stay in the country. (x2) 57) <- Congrats on having a specialization where you can step back into a skilled laborer position at $50K easily.","State of environmental science in the US right now I'm an international candidate who has been looking at jobs in the US. Headlines about proposed 25% cuts to the EPA and 97% cuts to fiunding to fight water pollution make things look pretty grim over there for environmental scientists and ecologists trying to win funding and make tenure. Changes to H1-B visas make even starting a job look like a huge hassle, too. Should I stay on my side of the ocean, or are things not as bad as they seem, given that state-level politics may ameliorate things and provide other funding avenues? I'm only interested in R1 positions, so research funding will matter. 2) I'd leave the US if I could. 3) Apply first, once you get the position, then you can decide.4) Sure apply first, but if it takes 6 months on top of the 6 month search to get a visa, who wants to bother. I could see SCs forego foreign applicants (some universities in the US already do, illegally, of course, because they don't want to bother with sponsorhip or negotiations over green cards) and applicants may not even bother to apply if they want ICE and the FBI  to thoroughly investigate their lives. I think that's the point here. 3) I'm a foreigner in the US, and I'm interviewing here and back home- and just PRAYING something works out back home. I think you can make a go of it, but it's not going to be the easiest time in US history to be a new prof on the tenure track 4) I am not sure it will be as bad as people think long run. Big programs like NSF have not been attacked, yet. The US research system remains the largest and best in the world, so if you can compete at that level, you should try to do so.5) Big programs like NSF haven't bene attacked yet? Where have you been? The 'attack' won't come in one big front, it's been under attack for the last 10 years. Funding rates are going down. Universities are demanding higher indirect cost rates and grant budgets are going up accordingly, so fewer grants are being awarded. . Look through the job announcements - most of those jobs are for positions that do not require NSF funds. People cannot depend exclusively on NSF funds for tenure or a career. Universities are on to this.  Funding rates in most of Europe are 20-40%. In the US NSF BIO funding is around 7%. If you don't believe me, look through NSF's DEB Brief for numbers. The prognosis is not good. I bet if Republicans win the 2018 election, the NSF will be gone. They have been making moves but have hesitated because of the uncertainty of political repurcussions. NSF funds so little of university budgets these days, the universities won't realize if a grant or two don't materialize because the uninterrupted stream of NSF funding hasn't been coming in for years. My sponsored research office discourages time spent on NSF proposals. They want DOD and other federal agency funds.  6) Reply to OP and #4: I don't think R1 SCs forego foreign applicants who are ALREADY in the US as PhD students or postdocs. They usually would go for the best candidates irregardless of nationality. But if you are not already in the US system as either a PhD or a postdoc, chances are they are not going to fly you to the US because you do not have any experience with the funding system in the US. As mentioned in another thread, you are competiting with American and international candidates who are already in the US, so while I don't think that R1 SCs will discriminate against international applicants, they are not likely to bring in someone who are not in the US at the moment for an interview, given that there are already so many outstanding candidates here and flying someone into the US costs a lot of money. 7) OP again. I'm in Australia. I had a Skype interview a few weeks back and someone on the SC has quietly (and unofficially) let me know that they are arguing internally over who to fly in for a campus interview. Maybe that's the issue. Winning funds in the US is not that different from winning funds in other countries. I've been a reviewer or review panellist for national science funds in several countries, and the basics are the same, plus looking beyond funding agencies, know how to work with industry. Re NSF funds, even if funding does not get cut, I wouldn't be surprised to see political interference to set research priorities for NSF funds, and those priorities seem unlikely to be environmental work. 8) Agree with all the gloomy forecasts but even so the funding and job availability is still better than most (not all) other countries. I do think flying international candidates in for interviews (whether they are citizens or not) is a real barrier and I know several people who were doing postdocs abroad and would list US addresses or write in their cover letter that they would already be in US for xx dates to try to get around that. Of course that means potentially footing your own bill for international travel just to be one of five finalists... 9) Anecdata: I have a UK PhD but am in the US. I'm apparently getting more traction in the UK/Australasia to the number of applications written than in the US. 10) Why do you think this is? Is it the way UK vs US PhDs are valued in different countries, or overall competition level higher in the US, or is it the subtleties of culture in the way we write applications? (Where the line is drawn between confident and arrogant, fopr instance)? 11) 9 here. There *is* a smaller applicant pool outside of the US for many positions, but there are fewer postings overall. I have enough postdoc experience at this point that my short PhD shouldn't be an impediment anymore. My PhD advisor is definitely part of the in-group in Europe, but people who don't go over there for conferences won't have necessarily interacted with him in person. I'm also not at an elite institution in the US (department is very strong in my field, but this is fairly recent), which seems to matter if you look at who gets shortlisted for R1 positions. Having read the application materials of someone who was fairly recently hired here, I'd say people can write overconfidently without getting dinged, but who knows. 12)From an Australian perspective, US application materials sometimes come across as arrogant, so I was wondering if Aus and Brit cover letters may come across as too hesitant in the US. 13) Hard to say. Aus and Brit applications are more likely to include responses to selection criteria based on a more specific position description, so it could also have something to do with the selection process. Two of my letter writers are English, and so possibly don't lay on the hyperbole as heavily. 14) I have heard from search committee members that European (especially UK) letter writers can lead to otherwise good applicants not making short lists because they tend to be less superlative and most US letter writers are writing incredibly strong letters for top candidates (of course some people realize this is the case and compensate for it, but with so much competition any little ding is enough to drop a few spots). 15) One has to wonder how informative those letters actually are (I've heard stories of people who had incredible letters written for them but turned out meh on the job).  16) The funding climate in the U.S. is complex.  As for ecology, it is and has been in the tank for some time.  There is very little money distributed among a very few sources and being requested by a very large chunk of people.  If you have 20-40% funding rate in Europe, it won't improve here.  Current president is anti-environment and always has been. ","For those postdocs, fresh Ph.D.s, and even assistant profs that complain about competing with tenured associate profs for the same position, I was just passed over for such a position for a non-tenured Ph.D. and I'm a tenured associate professor with a productive CV.  In the end, it's often about who they liked the most on their interview.  I was the last to interview for this position and could already tell from body language that some of the faculty that I was talking to had already made up their mind that they didn't much care for what I had to say; it was pretty obvious they already had a favorite in their head.  It's fine.  I would have taken a $15K paycut and probably would have turned the offer down anyway, but just some evidence that you are not at a disadvantage against more experienced candidates. 2) that blows OP. Sorry to hear about that. 3) Are you sure you didnt just psych yourself out after thinking they hated you, or not try bc you didnt want it?  4)  OP, again, no, I'm a calm guy, but I'm very perceptive.  There were three that definitely could have cared less that I was meeting with them, as if I wasn't even in consideration. I've been at the same place for 10 years and have been on a lot of SCs and chair of SCs and have talked to a lot of job candidates over the years and I've never seen such a lack of interest in a candidate from current faculty than what I saw at this place.  If they made me an offer I would have tried to negotiate first.  The starting was the same I started at as an assistant prof in 2007 and both this school and the school I currently work at are both M.S.level schools in the southeast.  Where I am has come up close to $10K with our offers in the last decade, but this place hasn't.  I explored the salary here before I agreed to an on-campus interview and the numbers I were seeing were ranging from $40K to $80K.  In the end it was closer the lower end of this range. 5) some Department are looking for potential, others prefer someone already independent, others don't care. It's all random. By the way, I totally understand the body language thing. It happened to me during a phone interview, they were visibly rushing me although I was not talking too much. It hurts honestly.  6)  OP, again, it seemed quite unprofessional, so I chalked it up as an invited research seminar to ad to my CV, a business trip with lots of free food, and a free notebook and pencil.  lol.  It's fine.  The important thing to note is that those who worry about competing with tenured folks should know it's not necessarily a factor.  I've got another interview in a few weeks where I'm competing with folks that aren't tenured too, so we'll see what happens with that one. 7) Hey there, I was the one asking (not complaining - if you please) about competing with tenured faculty. One reason was suprise to even have that level of experience disparity and another reason was suspecting that it was set up where I and the other post-doc candidates were there as filler. Lo and behold that tenured person got an offer. It is indeed extremely frustrating when you can tell you are wasting your time on an interview. 8) to OP, perhaps the school thought you weren't interested because you have a position? I hear that if you don't convey interest in the school/dept that the interviewers might not take a candidate seriously 9)Broader context: it's rare for TT ecology faculty positions advertised as ""asst/assoc"" or ""open rank"" to be filled at a rank above asst prof: https://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2018/02/26/how-often-are-n-american-tt-ecology-faculty-positions-advertised-as-asst-assoc-or-open-rank-filled-at-a-higher-rank-than-asst-prof/","Rejecting an offer -- Call or Email? I've recieved an offer I intend to reject. Can I do this by email or do I need to call and let them know? (It's for a full-time w/benes contract ""teaching faculty"" position -- a position I didn't even apply for but that they offered to me after my on-campus interview for a TT because apparently in the interview they ""liked me so much"" and ""could see how well I would fit into the department"" -- if that makes any difference.) 2) I would call if that's been the primary mode of contact so far. It's always more personal than an email and these people aren't in a vacuum, maybe another position you apply for in the future they know the chair and would say good things about you OP) Thx #2. We've communicated via email and phone (the offer was via phone but all other communication has been via email). I suppose the call is probably best -- I just have an aversion to phone conversations and was hoping for an external ""email is totally fine"" response :-)   3)   I assume this is a non-TT teaching position?  Do you have any other offers lined up? Do you have funding for the fall?  If not, might be worth considering to increase your experience while you look for a better position OP) @3,  I do have funding for the fall (actually have an offer for a postdoc with up to 5 yrs funding in a program strong in my field, which is what I'm turning down this position for). And yes it is non-TT. They call it a ""teaching track"" because there are opportunities for promotion along the same lines as with TT (Asst/Assoc./Full Prof of Clinical Teaching), but the work is technically contract work (2-yr contracts) so despite decent (albeit less than TT) pay and full benefits, they'll still sack you at first budget crisis and replace you with cheaper, non-benefited adjuncts. Unfortunate reality - I've seen more of these types of non-TT positions advertised lately. A way for Unis to attract some talent while keeping faculty sizes flexible I presume. ","I never understood TT applications asking for academic transcipts. I have a PhD - do you really need to know what grades I got in undergrad, plus it isn't like we get grades in graduate beyond classes we took for a Masters degree (if you did one seperatly). 1) no, nobody on a search committee cares about or looks at transcripts.  Transcripts are required for accreditation and/or HR pruposes.  There have been some high-profile cases of over the years where people did not actually have the necessary terminal degree they claimed to have. 2) Yes, this is usually an HR requirement as an official position requirement is usually something like ""Ph.D. in ________ or Ph.D. in related field with research experience and coursework in ___________"" and transcripts are what HR uses to verify this. This is why most places will accept copies of transcripts for the application, but if you are hired you often need to submit official transcripts. 3) I wouldn't worry about this - I did not have a good GPA for my undergrad (seriously, < 3.0) because I was one of those kids who didn't know how to live on their own after high school. Anyway, I did well during MS and PhD, but I was worried about how my undergrad grades would affect my competitiveness in the market. I got a TT job this year. Faculty aren't worried about grades, it really is just an HR thing. 4) I for one think that if someone can manage to publish a number of first authored papers and impress enough senior scientists to secure solid reference letters, who cares? I mean I know it has happened in some other fields that people fake their degrees, but it is hard to imagine how someone could do so in ecology/evolutionary biology in a way that would land them a faculty job. Seems like a waste of everyones time to request transcripts. And many Universities charge for official copies 5) Committees do look at both your grades and the courses you have taken. It isn't just an HR thing. 6) It is also a way to cut the pool of applicants down, as not everyone is willing to send their transcript in.","extending deadline of offer hi, a place that i would be happy with has offered me a TT position! great salary, startup, etc. But, the location is not perfect for my family. They gave me close to 3 weeks to decide, but I am waiting on outcomes of two other interviews. do you think its perfectly ok to ask for a few more days to make a decision? 2) Yep! Congrats! 3) Be sure to get the extension in writing, so that both sides are clear about it.","TFW a search committee member contacts you, suggests you apply for a position. You interview on Skype, but they are weird, indifferent, bored, don't look at camera, criticize you over nonsensical issues, etc. Then of course you don't get a campus invitation. You never know what's really going on behind the scenes. 2) No excuse for being rude no matter what is going on.  I had a faculty member suggest I apply for their search then in my chalk talk falsely claim other labs were already doing the main project that I presented.  People get totally weird about hires.  A lot is related to internal politics. 3) Even worse, when a search committee member encourages you to apply for a job and you don't even get a Skype interview... 4) University of Chicago, I'm looking at you...(x4) 5) Perhaps it's just me, but I feel like Universities that have contacted me to encourage me to apply (including U Chicago) do mostly to increase diversity in the application pool...no even a rec.letter from those...stop using me! 6) Had a SC say a lot of the right things re my work, invitation to campus soon followed, people were being generally nice and a few even said they'd love to have me as a colleague. Then I get bum-rushed by a bunch of cranky immunologists at the chalk talk telling me how my evo-genomics program would never get funded by their review sections..............some places are just horrible 7) @6 Chalk talks provide plenty of insights into what certain members (those who will be judging your tenure) of the department are like. Those self-proclaimed gods who claim they have the ability to determine whether your science ""would or would not be"" funded based on an hour interaction will remain A-holes after you are hired. Nothing worse than a department containing self-proclaimed gods, even if only a few... trust me. 8) #4 here, @5: Yep, I suspect they contacted me because I'm a woman and in the field they were searching in, and they wanted their pool to look good on paper (they never bothered to send a rejection). I've even been asked to apply for a job at a fancy university that wasn't even in my field. x2 9) @8, at my R1, our candidate pools get assessed relative to the diversity within the discipline.  For instance, if Evolutionary bio is 50/50 M/F, HR looks at our candidate pool has a 50/50 sex ratio, and if not, we are told to do a better job advertising to bring the #s up.  So yes, you could get recruited to apply to pad their candidate pool stats, esp. if you work in a male-dominated subfield.  10)  #8 again: Yep, male-dominated subfield with a lot of people with non-biology backgrounds. 11) I get that this is venting, but just want to give a bit of positive affirmation that in most cases asking a canidate to apply is genuine (at least I hope!). As a search committee member I ask people to apply that I think are awesome and would be great for the job, but I am only one person on a larger search committee with differing opinions. x3 12) if you're not going to take the time to email the people you encouraged to apply to let them know they didn't make the short list, didn't get an interview, didn't get the job or so on, don't say anything. x3 13) there's nothing wrong with differing opinions but being rude during a remote interview and then ghosting the candidate are, at the very least, a bunch of red flags 14) search committees are not allowed to contact people and tell them that they didn't make the short list/interview etc until after the search is over. It isn't ghosting, they are just not allowed to contact people who have officially applied for the job. Being rude is NEVER okay. But please don't take the lack of communication during the search as rudeness. If anything, people that are contacting candidates during the search are violating HR rules and making it an unfair process for all of the candidates. 15) Agree with 14, if the goal is to reduce bias in the hiring process, reaching out to individual candidates seems like a sure way to introduce bias. 16) yeah that's totally fine, no contact as per HR, that's OK. What's not ok is to encourage and then ghost. Simply, don't encourage, it's kind of simple.  17) Both #11 and 14 are absolutely correct. Just because someone invites you to interview doesn't mean the whole committee is on board with moving your application up. Also, you can't cherry pick who you notify before others are notified - there are rules.  Some follow them, others do not. 18) ""don't encourage"" seems like a terrible idea, I'd be thrilled if someone emailed me to tell that they thought I'd be great for a job (and I have a tt job) and I'd also know HR rules and that their encouragement didn't mean it was my job to have x2 19) OP here. I see a lot of merits here but somewhere we've gone off on a tangent about HR rules. Being rude had nothing to do with playing by the rules. Rather, when SC member A (a senior faculty member) contacts you to apply for a job, you apply, get an interview with the committee that consists of Senior B and 4 junior members. Senior A  is friendly to you. Senior B is an ass. Junior faculty members stare at table for 30 minutes. My impression is that while I have been asked to apply for several jobs, it's almost a death sentence to your application because the SC might be trying to do an end run around the committee. That's why this is under Venting!  20) @19 Trust me, you want to have at least one ally on the search committee. Maybe you don't know them ahead of time but you need someone rooting for you. 20) That is a fair vent, sorry we took the convo in the wrong direction. Senior B is just a total ass. x3","Competing offers I'm curious how people decide between competing offers. Would folks filling out the negotiations tabs be willing to fill in some related details in the comments section of that tab? 2) Might be easier if you have specific questions.  There are sooooo many factors we talked about in my family. 3) I had two competing offers at SLACs - both said they wouldn't budge an inch on salary and resources lol. 4) Make the decision that is best for you and your families lives, and consider turning them down if they arent going to competitively recruit you. Treat this as a business decision. 5) Sure financial/recruitment concerns are huge.  I think there's a lot more to it than that though FWIW. In particular, think about the location you will live in, schools if you might consider having kids or already have them, cost of living, opportunities within the department, how your department is perceived nationally/interationally, resources the school has to recruit new faculty, whether others in your field are in the department, tenure rates/support, whether you will have the freedom to do what you want or will be forced to teach specific things etc.  Ultimately it often becomes an apples to oranges comparison.  For me one school offered way more salary and the other couldn't get close, but opportunities for my family were exceedingly better in the lower-paying place.  It's hard to compare such disparate opportunites and ultimately it comes down to an informed guess."
"utterly hopeless! AHHHHH, why can't I get a job!!!!!! (1) I feel your pain! On the plus side, I dont have to worry about what to wear to an interview.....jeans and t-shirt work at Walmart! (2) Yeah, I feel that. Maybe I have to return to programming.

3) Hey, you know what we could do? We could develop a computer virus. How's it work you wonder? ""It's pretty brilliant. What it does is, every time there's a bank transaction where interest is competed, you know, thousands a day, the computer ends up with these fractions of a cent, which it usually rounds off. What this does is, it takes those little remainders and puts it into an account.""
""That sounds familiar.""
""Yeah, they did it in Superman III."" 
4) Damn it feels good to be a gangsta!
5) God damn it I want to smash up a printer or some old computer. 
6) I want to live in a biodome with the weee-sellll.  7) 13 years of post-high school education and it is this freaking competitive to get a job in this profession? Urgh!","responding to offer What is a reasonable amount of time to respond to an offer? School1 wants a response within a week, I won't hear from school2 for another 10 days. I feel like 2-3 weeks is a reasonable amount of time to respond, but school1 is really putting the pressure on.  1) So, school 1 can't wait 3 days? What is the downside to accepting school 1's offer, because it is the only one that you have at the moment (and therefore, the best), while waiting for school 2 to make a decision? If you'd rather work at 2, then you simply say you have a better offer and move on. Are our reputations really on the line with something like this or is it just SC scare tactics.

2) Tough situation if you like both schools.  As long as you like #1  and think you'd be happy there (even if you would prefer to work at 2), I would advise against turning down 1 and saying you have a better offer (namely, you really don't have an offer).  As far as your original query, 10-14 days is very common and reasonable. If they are pressuring you, they either have a specific deadline/agenda or they are very, very afraid of losing you to another offer.  If the latter, you have the upper hand for sure.  I would politely request an extension to 10 days from school 1, citing that this is a major family and life decision that you do not want to take too hastily.  At around day 8 or 9, I'd start contacting school 2 and mention that you have a good offer on the table about to expire, but that you are really interested in their school.  If you are school 2's best candidate, I suspect they could speed up the process to snag you.  Good luck; it's an envious situation you're in.

3) #2, unless I misread (not wearing reading glasses!), there is another possibility.  The committee may be split between two candidates and be certain the second will take the position, but they are throwing it your way first with a short deadline to get it over with.  

4.) #3 But how could a SC ever be certain that the 2nd choice candidate would accept?

5) #4, either they may know that person's situation very well, they may have inside info from a reference, or its not so much that they know that #2 will take it as much as they really want #1, but are certain this person won't take it and they want to ensure they get at least #2.  Sure, both could turn it down, but this strategy is used. 
  
",NA,NA,NA," 1) Any idea how many people made the shortlist for this position and the Env. Chem position?  I was asked for letters for the Env. Chem position shortly before the holiday but never heard back about a phone interview. 2) All I know about the bio post is that I made the short list and they asked for my availability on that date.  THe post here is for bio position! I just added a line fo rthe chemistry post so that we can keep them separate.  :)  1) Thanks!  I didn't get any questions about availaility, but I'm sure that different people were in charge of the searches and didn't necessarily write the same emails to us. 4) Yes, different committees.  There is probably some overlap because the EVS program shares faculty with bio and chem.  I would be shocked if there are not some folks on both committees.  I only applied for the bio position, although I can do tox analysis like a chemist, it would be a stretch to teach chemistry courses! :)  Unless I am mistaken, the chem position was open last year too.  1) Yes, I also applied to the chem position last year, but never heard anything from them.  The position description fits my background really well, so I am excited about the possibility. I also really like that there is a tox hire as well, since I can see a ton of potential collaborations between the 2 positions (at least given the research I would do). ## Same here! 2) It appears that it is a joint search committee, did you get an invitation?  1) I haven't heard anything from them yet, but they did ask last weekend to check on a letter of rec they thought they were missing.  2) I'll bet they do the chemistry after the biology, my guess is there are probably multiple candidates who fit both positions and applied for both.  Not me though.  1) Just got the email for a phone interview the week of the 28th. 2) COOL!  Mine was very pleasant for bio one.  Fingers crossed! :) 1) Thanks!  2) Do you know when they will be contacting peoploe for on campus? 1) I have no idea, maybe they want to get through the phone interviews for the Env Chem position first and then will decide who they want to bring? Especially if they have some overlap between the candidates. My phone interview is the morning of the 28th.  2) Yes, that is a good point.  I know they want to bring the bios in in Feb, probably same for chems.  I would be just about shocked if there is not a candidate or two who is capable of doing both posts. 2) so how did it go! :) 1) It went really well, lasted about 30 minutes.  I feel good about it,so I think I have shot at an on campus.  They told me their time line was to do the interviews in February.  3) Get a room. 2) I had the same feeling.  We will see, sound like you were told the same stuff as I! :) 2) Any news? 1) Yep, I got an interview the first week in March. You? 2) nope, I have not heard anything.  When did you hear? 1) I'm sorry to hear that. I got a phone call Friday, but not any additional information.  2) Life goes on.  These are two separate searches, I would think a chem-bio person has a huge advantage over a pure bio person like me.  My areas are more along the lines of biomonitoring, although I do have signficant trianing in instrumentation. ","I fucking had to teach one of the hardest subjects in my field today, and before that happened (at fucking 8:00 AM), I fell down a flight of stairs and broke my big toe. Then I got to work and received a rejection email from a campus interview that I thought would result in an offer. My husband then got a letter from the IRS saying that he owes them $2K from a miscalculated refund they gave him in 2006. Like... today is possibly one of the worst fucking days of the year and it's only January. I want to blow up the month of January. 2) Now that is a proper rant. That sucks OP!! 3) Well that's worse than the rejection from a campus interview that I got on New Year's Eve! Damn.  2) hey but at least you have your health, er, um, well health outside of your toe. Sounds a lot like my day.  5) OP again... and now I have the fucking flu. 6) Dear OP, hang in there. 7) what doesn't kill you makes you stronger,...or it makes you a withering invalid. ","deleting jobs 1) There is a position at a SLAC I am VERY interested in; I have read in some places that it is acceptable to send an email for an update on where they are in the hiring process. (a) Do you think this is OK, (b) How long do I wait to send the email and (c); how should I word it to sound excited but not desperate or impatient? 2) If it is >2-3 weeks past the closing date, I would say you aren't in the mix if you didn't interview. If you interviewed, I would say wait until ~2 weeks after the last person was on campus. As for what to say, I think that's better answered by someone who has been on SCs at SLACs. (2) Be patient - no news is good news.  Emails like that are more likley to annoy people. 3) @2 No news is good news until it's bad news.  I've had a rejection after a campus interview take six months.  Still, I agree that #1 has to be patient.  Sucks waiting though. 4) I thought for sure I hadn't gotten a phone interview at the SLAC I really wanted to work at, and a couple days later, I got the phone interview invitation. Then I thought for sure I wouldn't be invited to campus, but I got the invitation right after I had given up hope. Went there, rocked it, got the offer, and have just accepted. Moral of the story: people at SLACs are really busy. This one had 2 searches going on in the department (and I was involved in the 2nd search), so that made it extra busy for them. Just wait it out, and good luck! 1b) Thanks for all the advice and encouragement!  5) I just had a rejection email sent for a position I applied for and interviewed for three, yes 3, that is THREE YEARS ago!  I KID YOU NOT. 6) #5, that is some SHIT! 1b) Is there a point where it is OK? The place I don't really want is pushing up their timeline to make an offer soon, but the place I REALLY want... might just be to busy to be at the next stage of the search?  If I just knew that I don't have a chance at the one I want, maybe I could be more settled about the other. 7) I think you can use an offer from the less desirable to gather info from the other.  Something along the lines of, ""I don't mean to rush you, but I've had this other offer and they need an answer... I'd rather wait to hear the results of your search, but could you let me know when that might be?""  8) I agree, totally legit to ask if you have another offer. 1c) Thank you!","Anyone else hate waking up to ""references requested""? Today it was Missouri. Super pumped to learn I didn't make the top 20% there. 2) agreed! I'm gonna keep telling myself they had something/somebody in mind even if it was suposedly open","Deleted info 1) Any thoughts on why some of the notes on the main page get deleted? Is there a reason that we should not be providing information on having interviews scheduled, etc.?  2) Page creator here: hopefully just carelessness not active vandalism.  I set it up so that the main columns are protected but the comments aren't.  Not sure how to fix it so that it's both easy to use and deletion-free.  I looked at the recent history and reverted the deletion of the Penn info, but I don't have time to police this page. 3) Thanks for creating and managing! Re: OP, maybe faculty at the institutions don't want info getting out before they've made final decisions? ","phone interviews in times of whatsup, skype, gchat and others - it is so aweful! you cannot see or clearly hear the committee and have to mostly guess the names and questions. Is it only me? or the committees should really switch to online/video calls? 2) it's kind of funny, eh? It tends to be an indicator of a technology unfriendly/ more 'traditional' department to me. 3) I don't know. I've found the phone interviews to be a bit more reliable in some cases and honestly I kind of like not having to see the people (or not having them able to see me) so I can look at notes, etc. The exception is phone interviews where several different people are asking questions and you can't tell who is speaking; most that I've had involved one person asking most or all of the questions with others just listening. 4) My experience is that videoconf gives a better feel for the people, but phone gives better sound and is still more reliable 5) The reliability of the phone is a big deal. I've had skype konk out on one side or the other, not get a campus invite, and then I tend to blame skype :) I think the best format is the multi-screen skype, so that all interviewers and interviewees are on the same exact platform. The room of people on skype is slighly more awkward imo. 6) yes, room is awkward on skype, especially if the person who asks is at the very far end:-) Concerning the phone though - it is an awful sound for my cell and I know that my voice is too high pitch and even my family sometime misunderstands me in my native language:( but hope it came out ok, still waiting for the decision though","post campus interview  How long before folks hear back from the SC? (2 weeks post last interview) 2) Highly variable.  3) agreed, highly variable.  Usually within 2 weeks of the last interview, but some institutions have an approval process that must go through multiple administrators, so it can take longer. 4) Agreed... for some it can take years....before the rejection. 5) I've heard back from as little as 4 weeks to 2 years post interview. 6) #5, why in the world would u hear 2 years after the interview? 7) Sometimes rejection letters never get sent until much later. It's rather comical. I received rejection letters up to a year after I accepted my first position. 8)apparently in the 2 year case, there was a 'prolonged negotiation.' 9) Or my favorite, you never hear! (x3!) 10) No. 9 reflects so poorly on the SC, but it is not uncommon :/ 11) My favoriate #9 case: SC chair tells me I was well received and I will hear from them in a month. Two months pass and I ping them. Then many months pass with no reply, and that is how the story ends! 12) that's always the fun part - believing their word that they liked your visit, thanked you for your time and hope to see more of you but the phone never rings. I wish people could just ignore the niceties and emotional aspect of it. 13) @12, I've told people that sincerely, and then then we did not make an offer to them.  We often have searches where we're like, these three were all awesome (for three different reasons), which one do we go with?  ","Had a skype interview today. Wish I could say that I nailed it, but I totally didnt. I didnt understand the premise of one question AT ALL and definitely didnt answer it well. Even in hindsight, I'm not sure what they were asking. 2) That happens to me all the time. It's very likely that it wasn't as bad as you think. We always make too much of each and every miniscule detail. 3) There's definitely still hope - I've been invited to visit campuses after Skype interviews that I thought I bombed x4. 4) and I've not been invited onsite after a phone/Skype went swimmingly well! 5) Yes, the only campuses I was invited to this year were places I had awkward, seemingly-bad interviews. Heard nothing after the ones I felt most positive about. 6) I think the SC has 3 favorites to invite on-campus. Those people will be invited no matter how the skype/phone interview goes, unless they say something really wrong, such as cursing, racist/sexist jokes, etc. I know from a friend in a SC (not in our field) that a candidate was driving while phone interviewed, he didn't care about pulling over, and mentioned the word ""shit"". It was the favorite on the paper, but not invited. Otherwise, it is pretty much done in advance to my opinion. 7) << I think you're right about that (after having sat on an SC) 8) Don't worry OP. I thought I totally bombed my Skype interview but ended up getting a campus interview. I couldn't give a clear answer as to what class I would teach, and I had no extension plan, even though the position had a big extension component. Lack of prep on my part. Blah, who knows what they're looking for. You're probably ok if you impressed them with a few answers! 9) Sometimes phone interviews are performed because of schisms on the committee. Each faction wants to convince the swing voter(s) on the committee that their favorite candidate is perfect for the job and should be interviewed. In that case, it's a fight being waged by the Greek gods up in the clouds, and the mere mortals (the interviewees) are but pawns.","""Research"" Faculty I just don't really know what to think about this position and wondering if folks here can help (I just got a Skype interview for it). It's a ""Research Assistant or Associate Professor"" funded through a NOAA program (for now?). I understand that's non-TT but what's confusing is that someone in the Dept has one of these and also has a postdoc elsewhere simultaneously. I'm planning to ask the SC about the set up & long-term potential, funding duration, etc. but not sure how much to buy what they're selling. Since I'm shooting for a TT at R1 (just finishing my first postdoc now; got 1 on-campus this year for TT), could I/should I treat such a job as a nice 2nd research postdoc? Or will it tank my TT options in the future to have a non-TT position? So confusing! (Also all the women at this place are like this or adjunct, which is super off-putting). 2) At our institution, research professors are partly funded through the department and/or the vice president for research, and are expected to fund the rest of their salary through grants they obtain themselves, either as PI, Co-I, or senior personnel. I don't think it will tank your chances at TT at all, since this usually a research focused position, and you would likely have the ability to bring in your own grants. One thing to ask about is what happens if you don't or can't fund your own salary. At our institution, the FTE gets reduced, which obviously impacts pay. 3) Ah, interesting, thanks. Does the salary get covered for some amount of time though before you have to bring in your own $? 4) The two cases I know of (friends that were offered research positions), they were each granted two years of salary (90K-ish for both) before it was sliced in half. After those two years, they could pretty much make whatever they wanted, dependent on the money they could bring in. Both turned the positions down for lower paying jobs where their pay checks were guarenteed. 5) Thanks, that helps me know what questions to ask. ","The startup they've offered me is less than I make in a year as a postdoc.  And from that I'm supposed to buy all of the essential lab equipment, and the consumables to generate the preliminary data to launch 1-2 grant proposals.  In a department where most of the current faculty are tenured but don't have grants.  But who knows if I'd even get an offer next year if I say no and stay in my postdoc?  I know I'm complaining about an offer when lots of people don't have one, but this is still...bad in its own way. 2) A sub-50k startup is ridiculous if the department really expects you to churn out 2 grants for tenure. Is this at an R1/R2? 3) It's an R2.  60/30/10 teaching/research/service 4) Having also turned down offers, a bad offer is hardly better than no offer. This is (potentially) the rest of your career - it's ok to be picky/demanding. 5) You need two successful proposals, or just need to submit and recieve good feedback on two proposals? The former impossible, the latter very probable. 6) I am expected to submit grants.  I am not expected to get them.  I am expected to publish a handful of papers while on the tenure track, but I suspect I have enough unpublished data already on hand to make that plausible even without generating new data.  It would just feel extremely disingenuous to go in with that plan. 7) You can definitely submit grants - that only requires time. If they don't care whether the data for pubs are from your new job, publish your old-data papers when you are there. If they aren't putting you in a position to get new data, you only can use your old data - nothing disingenuous about that - you are just doing the best you can do with the resources you have available. Sucks about the salary, but from everything I read, hear, and have been offered, academic salaries outside of R1 and top SLACs are awful. 8) Just take the job. Trust me it's WAY better than the postdoc job ya have. Thank me later. 9) Ended up declining.  Which was very scary to do, but I have hope I can do better.","Internal candidates and Skype interviews Do search committee's do Skype interviews with a candidate who is employed at the same institution (someone not part of their department)? Just curious as I have applied where I'm at now. 2) Depends on the committee.  For faculty positions, it's actually not uncommon -- it reduces the potential for bias if all the candidates are treated the same regardless of whether they're local. 3) I applied to a position in a different department but at the same Uni and they had me skype like everyone else.  I agree that it's only fair. 4) My (R1) institution HR has this as an explicit search policy. I imagine there are very similar policies across institutions. 5) As an internal candidate, yes, they do. It was awkward since I knew all the people and we were in different rooms in the same building, but as 2 said, it is meant to reduce bias. 6) We just did this for a search. One internal and two external. It kept things similar. I peronally feel that the ""onsite"" interview will be way more awkward. 7) I just got a request to schedule a video conference interview for the full-time version of a position I am currently doing half-time.  At the same institution, working with the same people.  It'll be slightly awkward (eg if they ask ""What experience do you have with courses like X?"", the honest response would be ""I am teaching two sections of that exact course this semester"", but I'll modify it to be a bit less weird), but I do get it; it's much more fair to the external candidates if they're being evaluated the same way that the internal candidates are.","SC member here-- please, PLEASE when you're including in prep/in review publications on your CV, do not list them under the same subheading as your in press/published papers. By all means, include them, but put them in their own sub-section. +1 2) Wow, some SC members are really picky about the same information presented in different ways, considering there is no published format that applicants are required to follow. x2 3) You try looking through 150+ applications. People need to present their info succinctly and honestly. 4) I hear you, SC member. Thanks for adding your thoughts. I'm always surprised when applicants put in prep/in review pubs in with the rest of their publications. Just confuses everything. A separate section AFTER the published ones is the right place for them. And, for the record, I'm an applicant, not an SC member -- just to be clear. 5) I remember seeing a CV where they had numbered their publications, counting down, from newest to oldest, except very last were about 5 ""in prep"" manuscripts. They were in the easiest spot to miss-count. 6) I'm honestly amazed anyone still does this. I have been told not to since the early years of grad school, and it also just makes sense / is the honest thing to do. Although then again every now and again twitter flares up with some discussion of how preprints are still pubs...6) 2, again...yes, I agree...separate categories makes it much easier if you are just counting and not really looking at the pubs. 7) FWIW, I have in prep/in review manuscirpts in the same section as those published, have had my CV looked at by several people (some of whom have been on many SCs) and have not had anyone say it is ""dishonest"" or anything. Having decent luck in my job search as well. 8) seems to me a submitted manuscripts is a ""real"" manuscript - it may not be published by the currently-reviewing journal, but as a repeated SC member and chair, manuscripts in review are perfectly appropriate to include with the main body of pubs in my opinion.  I have very different feelings towards ""in prep"" manuscripts.  These are typically not yet written and can represent anything from a lingering dataset to a cool idea to a paper that is nearly complete.  When I see as many papers ""in prep"" as in review (or published, in some cases) alarms start ringing in my head.  I advise keeping the ""in prep"" manuscripts confined to your research statement - unless the paper is basically written and your planned submission is within a few weeks, don't add it to the list of pubs on your CV. 9) I always kept everything under the same heading. I even have included some of those in prep manuscripts as writing examples, when required to provide a writing example. I received multiple tenure track offers. I think if you have one publication, and you stick 10 in prep publications under the same heading, that will look bad. However, if you have 20 pubs and you have 2 listed in review and 2 listed as in prep, who really cares? Oh..sorry, OP...THE OP REALLY CARES ABOUT THIS...YOU CAN TELL BECAUSE THEY WROTE 'PLEASE' IN ALL CAPS.  10) Indeed, some people care a great deal about this, and not just the OP.  Including line-items on your CV is a trade-off in the case of not-yet-official papers - irritate SC members or have a less impressive-looking list of pubs?  Seems like if there is an actual draft of an actual manuscript, listing it is legit.  The question I ask myself is this: what if someone looking at my CV asks for a copy of this paper?  If I can provide something tangible and complete, it is ok to list it on my CV.  11) My $0.02: It's not a ""pub"" until it's ""published"" (or at least accepted).  Keep the rest under ""Manuscripts in review"" or ""In preparation"". 12) preprints are bs, dont do it.  13) @12 I swear the molecular cell people in my (very good) department think their manuscripts placed on bioRxiv are of equal weight as peer-reviewed and accepted manscripts (rolling eyes). 14) to be fair, most of the molecular work out there is descriptive so it doesn't change much between preprints and published form 15) The preprints I've posted were published with virtually no changes (we're talking some extra cross references to supplementary figures and maybe five extra sentences). 16) @15, sounds like either blind luck or youre a molecular person. the standards are very different in more quantitative fields 17) am I the only one laughing at the idea that a molecular person would be any less quantitative than another field? this whole discussion is stupid. If you don't beleive in preprints, don't do them. But I know plenty of established scientists who are reviewing applications that will disagree with you. 18) Established scientists dont respect the peer review process? That's a little horrifying. Maybe we should all ""write"" papers with catchy titles and fill them with Lorem ipsum to better our chances 19) Some really lame strawmen being constructed here... 20) Not as lame as listing unfinished work on your cv 21) @18, yes plenty of established scientists see flaws in the current way the peer review process works. Not to say that peer review in itself is a bad idea, but the system certainly has flaws. You can find plenty commentary on the topic if you spend even a minute looking. But go ahead and tell me more about your personal feelings, please. 22) @16: Nope, my preprints weren't especially unusual re: the extent of the revisions, and I'm quantitative. There's nothing magic about pre-publication peer review. People can read the preprint and judge for themselves. Lorem Ipsum would yet you rejected from biorXiv. 23) In what way are preprints an improvement on peer review? Again, if you are unable to articulate an argument other than ""older people I know like preprints"", you should ask yourself why you believe it is so. Funnily enough, positions based on nothing have a tough time getting through peer review.","Emailed the faculty vote I was accidentally emailed the faculty vote results by the chair of a search. Anybody have that happen? I sat in a close second behind the two other candidates, 5/3/5 vs 3/64 in first-second-thirds. Any help interpreting appreciated!  2) I'm not sure I know what you mean by close second behind two others? And those numbers? But in any case, I wouldn't even bring it up. 3) I'm not sure I understand the numbers you shared, but getting the support of even a few faculty members in a search is a big deal.  It means you are close, and with a little luck or a slightly more broadly-appealing pitch you may be able to get over the hump.  It's hard to get to this point and I've been there before -- it feels soul crushing but I think having a conversation about the search outcome with the chair could be very informative.  As 2) said, I wouldn't bring up the specific votes unless they mention it. 4) Thanks a lot all 5) Oops... that was a slip up. Are you sure that wasn't suppose to be ""3/6/4""?  Maybe 5/3/5 was their first meeting, and given the tie, they fought within themselves and met again, and you won. Faculty again fought. But human resources stepped in and said your voting method is totally screwed up, so they were forced to meet a third time to just vote on the two candidates who originally tied for first place.  They fought again - and somebody decided to just flip a coin.  Its a lottery, keep buying a ticket and eventually you will win! 6) My reading was the first two got 5/3/5 and he/she got 3/6/4."
"Utica and Ramapo What gives? Two SLAC have each re-advertised AGAIN.  With this large of an applicant pool, something is clearly not right.  Either we all suck, or SC's really need to advertise their specific needs.  I find it hard to believe that with >100 people applying per position, they can't find a match.   What do you all think? (1) We ALL suck!!! And we're probably all douchebags in some way, too. (2) @1, LOL! (#) I disagree. Both position were for plant ecologists/biologists. Ergo, only plant people are douchebags. However, if the U of Pacific search also ends up failing, well, that would prove that animal ecologists are also all douchebags, leaving microbial and theoretical ecologists alone as the rear-guard in the battle against the encroaching douchebaggery. (3) Damn, I hate being a DB! Then again, its the animal, theoretical, and microbial ecologists that are making the decision who to invite, so I think in the end, they are the DB's! :) (4) Damn you, #3, for your unassailable logic! Now I must face the fact, demonstrated by your pure logic, that I am, (SOB), a... a... a... d-d-d-d-douchebag! ;-)

Out of 100 applications, if you can pull 20 to whittle down to a dozen for phone interviews, you are lucky. Pick three of those...if you can, and the odds are that at least one will suck outright. One may be okay, and the other may do well. Sometimes ALL THREE will suck. I have seen at least 5 jobs go without a hire on this wiki this year alone. And no, it doesn't mean the SC's are lame...it means the candidates were not a match in one way or another.","Wiki format Last year, it was the endless personal polls and collection of information, this year, it's the negative anonymous comments and the personal attacks.  WTF.  Can't we just have a simple website to update everyone on status of searches and leave out all the BS?   (1) Wow, couldn't agree more. This thing has turned into an addictive cesspool of vitriol, negativity, gossip, unfounded accusations and whining. And yet I keep coming back because I want updates on the status of the jobs. Let's try to cut the crap and keep it about the JOBS! 2) hmmm, whining, negativity, and gossip about whining, negativity, and gossip...count me in! <=humor (3) Thanks for the humor disclaimer #2...I was just about to ""slam"" you with an exceedingly viscious personal assault for daring to voice your opinion! <= more humor (4) Whatever, I suggested this months ago, and some whiner moved it to the venting page. Personally, the venting page is a very unwise page to have on here. 5) hmmm, whining about past whining and more whining about whining...love it! <=more humor (6) Is it possible to have some kind of moderated site? For example, a full half of the comments to this question at this point are totally unnecessary (and not particularly clever or funny). My guess is that it is a couple of trolls crapping all over everything. (7) And WHINERS! (see #5 above for ironic note, see #6 for confirmation!). 8) #4 Major CHIME. (8) OP - I rest my case. (9) it was intended to be self moderated, with folks yanking blatantly aggressive statements. Then someone threw up the venting page, which I do not agree with. Oh well. (10) Personally, I don't see any harm in a little unmitigated spleen. It's a tough market out there, and people need an outlet for their frustration. Nothing should be taken personally, because it's all anonymous! And I doubt seriously that the presence of the venting page will have any real negative consequences. What are the colleges and universities going to do, gang up and hire no one? That's pretty close to the current situation anyway. (11) OP - people may need an outlet for frustration, but I suggest this isn't the place. Go for a walk or something, don't take it out on others. (12) There is a great website that only posts the status of searches. It is called the open vacancies sheet in this workbook. Give it a gander! (13) Wow, the comments must really be offending people...the last time I looked there were at least 3 more comments after 12.  I was one of them, and, 12, you're still my hero!",NA,NA,NA,"Several have remarked on the fact that updates, especially for prime positions, are spotty. I suggest that this is because the R1's are hiring only well-established stars for their ""ground-floor"" slots that already have huge amounts of grant money. Those are not the kinds of people to be checking the wiki. Thoughts? Also, is it wise for departments to get all gaga over grant money and hire someone further along in their careers? It seems like a recipe for creating a department full of drama and prima donnas who are not invested in the department long term. If I was on a search committee at a big R1, I would hire someone with a lot of money and publications. And yes...I think that these people don't check the wiki as much. (2) I like to think that smart departments will hire up-and-coming stars who are not established but have a big future. Hiring big names often means those people have their best years behind them. I don't think those people are drama queens tho - many established stars I have met are amazingly nice and down to earth. (3) everyone is nice 1 on 1, but in a social or departmental context, it always amazes me the primal behavior and posturing that comes out (4) yes, I think a lot of spots are going to people moving from one TT job to another and that those people are less likely to be on the wiki (5) I also gather that getting a tt job is a ticket into the system--the route to getting a more desirable tt position, whether it be a more fitting department or one in a more favorable geographic region.  Getting the first one one is a nerve-wracking crap-shoot though.  6) IDK guys, I'm already tenured and have been looking for greener pastures for the last three years to no avail.  Of course, for the first two years I was not tenured, so maybe potential employers were scared that there was something wrong with me since I was so close to getting tenure, but looking elsewhere.  I also have not been applying many places, so I have a smaller sample size to report from. 7) My experience is that the stars look at the wiki all the time, but don't post nearly as much, if at all.","Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck! (ok, this felt good. Now back to my miserable underemployed adjunct life. No new shoes for the kids this year) 2) I can't provide much materially for my kids, either. On good days, I tell myself the freedom of our schedules allows me to be with them a lot. Good luck!","Dudeisms 1) I never had interview with chalk talk, but last month I had one. How should I handle chalk talk? I feel like I only told my search committee the big picture of my proposals, but not going into the details of each aims, and timeline, and retional... feel pretty bad after the interview...But my research talk was prepared well. 2) I wonder how common these are. It honestly seems like a great idea from the committee's perspective...but horrible from the candidate's. I would love to hear about any resources people had. 3) There are diff definitions of chalk talk, even some that everyone remains silent.  Do you mean giving a talk on a chalk board instead of using powerpoint? 4) No, #3. A chalk talk is an informal outlining of your research aims for grant writing/trajectory. They want to know that you have the ability to think thoroughly about your research field and answer very direct questions about the weaknesses of your research. It is essentially your proposal defense but with much higher stakes since they are weighing your ""fundability"" and not just your competency. Good luck.  5) I did a chalk talk last week and it actually went pretty well (well, it seemed to).  I put a brief title and the aims/questions for each grant up on the board ahead of time, so that people weren't waiting on me to write things up.  Then I left room on the bottom of the board to more spontaneously draw diagrams and graphs.  I also kept notecards with me to glance down at to remind me of the points I wanted to make.  I used these articles for advice: http://www.labspaces.net/blog/1038/The_chalk_talk http://www.asbmb.org/asbmbtoday/asbmbtoday_article.aspx?id=48709 6) That's really good advice. I agree. ",What's wrong with being married?,"In the dark Has anyone ever contacted someone on a search committee to see whether they were close to making the shortlist? I feel like one of the worst things about this process is not having any real sense as to whether you are competitive until you actually find out that you were competitive. 2) I sympathize but suggest not doing this. If you apply to enough positions this season, you'll get a sense of your competitiveness, so you'll have more information in a few months. Until then, it's not going to do anything to help you and may actually contribute negatively to your overall well-being. This process is not good for us, but what you described makes more work for someone (imagine responding to that ~200 times) without any benefit to anyone. 3) I am curious about this too, considering that I have been on the market for a few years. Is it my documents, record, something else or does it come down to fit. I have considered soliciting the input of Karen Kelsky (The Professor is In blog) who can provide feedback on these matters, but her services are expensive. She also does not have a science background, so may not be the best person to gauge competitiveness for us.... Our best bet is probably our advisors.  4) Contacting search committee members is very unlikely to get you any useful info (aside from the issues raised by #2, there are also potential legal issues).  If you meet a search committee member in person and really hit it off, you might obliquely enquire, but still: unlikely.  One good way to get a feel would be to serve on a search committee at your current institution (this is absolutely eye-opening) or at least pay attention to who gets interviews at your place and check their packages if possible.  Inspect the ""Anon Quals"" tab here. 5) Karen is good, but she doesn't excel in science. Not sure how much it matters. Don't write the committee. Karen will tell you this, everyone will tell you this. It will piss people off. I was ""on the market"" for a few years, with few nibbles. This year is excellent with two Skypes and a third on campus so far. It may be fit, but it may be finally taking the job materials seriously. I asked EVERYONE for letters, and put probably 50 hours into my statements, and put 3-4 into each new cover letter. Part of that came from working with Karen. Part of it came from doing this a ton of times. Also, if you can get a VAP type position, you might find that you can talk way more maturely about teaching and department issues than just being a postdoc. And that gives confidence throughout the written and oral parts of the interview process. And finally, I used to think that my time since PhD was working against me....I'm not so sure that's true now. I'd say in general, when you stop ""worrying about being in the dark"", you've gotten to the place where your phone is likely to ring. 6) I've been advised by several faculty mentors that, if *you* are contacted by the committee (i.e., you made a short enough list to have a phone call rejection or have a friend on the faculty who's giving you the bad news), you might as well ask ""Is there anything that you can tell me that might help me strengthen my packet for next year?"" Definitely not contacting the committee while the decision is in progress, but might garner you a little bit of feedback in retrospect. 7) Faculty friends should tell you when you are off the list. Otherwise, that's what the wiki is for...to combat darkness. Rule #1 of this is to not contact the committee until they've contacted you, and at an appropriate level of engagement. If they ask for a missing letter, it's ok to follow up with: ""did you get it."" But not: ""did I make it."" If two weeks pass after a phone interview, it's ok to send one brief email reminding them you are interested. If they don't answer...they aren't. If you made it on campus, you can ask a: ""what can I do better next time"", but understand that if HR has done their job, you often aren't allowed to get much in the way of feedback. 8) OP here, I should have been more specific—I was specifically interested in whether people have contacted committees in years past after decisions were made. It sounds like even that is frowned upon so I'll be sure to avoid it. Thanks for the input. This is my first year on the market so I'm acclimating to the process. 9) It's so interesting how advice and info varies. Regarding the comment from #5, I've been told by nearly everyone that the cover letter is not very important so mine is pretty standard. It's good, but I don't change it much among apps. 10) #5 here. I think that my biggest mistake in years past was a short, formulaic, cover letter, and a vague research statement. Karen's book advises against that, and her advice agrees with the statements from friend-emies who got jobs last year that I wanted. So now, my cover letter is 2 pages (which before everyone told me is bad), and my research statement is 6 pages (again, against the advice of many). However, the market has changed. I think departments want a whole research plan, and are expecting more from candidates who are, on average, about 4 years more senior than was the case 5 years ago. 11) #9 here. I appreciate your input—despite the tone (edit, #10 changed their comment so tone is no longer condescending)—but of the ten or so successful apps I've seen they have all had cover letters that are one page and research statements under three pages. Perhaps it is field specific, but a six page research statement is not normal in my area. 12) Thank you #10/5 for the candid input.  13) I'm on a search committee right now at an R1.  Just as I didn't read this entire box of comments-- I'm not reading your 6 page research statement in its entirety. If you can't say it in 2-3 pages, you need to work on making your writing more compact. Super-famous senior faculty around here explain their research in 2 pages... and so can you. 14) lol 15) #5/10 here...for what it's worth, I got a very exciting R1 offer. 16) #15, would you mind putting your negotiation on the negotiation page? 17) #10 here. Absolutely, as soon as they are finalized. I'm working on the startup list now. ","Any other postdocs affected by the FLSA injunction? 1) which colleges are affected 2) University of Illnois Urbana-Champaign 3) My raise went into effect but I'm not sure for how long. 4) Oklahoma State University, some of us got raises to avoid it 5) Some universities took back those raises when the injunction happened. I wasn't sure which universities kept the raises in place. 6) University of Nebraska promised all postdocs a raise...then SIKE! They're on hold till we see what's gonna happen. 7) Purdue University is the same as #6 8) The University of Missouri - St. Louis offered me a raise to comply with FLSA, and to my surprise, they stuck to their word! This is especially surprising given that the school is going through hard financial times. ","campus near nuclear power plant Is it just me, or would it be normal to be concerned if you find out after an interview that the university is near (within 10 miles) a nuclear power plant, close enough for special FEMA rules to be effective. Should I be concerned? 2) Is it anywhere near a geographic fault line? 3) It's in a green area and not far from a yellow: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1366603/Earthquake-map-America-make-think-again.html  But I think a larger concern would be the state of FEMA, DOE and the NRC, in a few years. 4) I interviewed at a school near a nuclear plant and must say it was a little disconcerning.   5) I grew up within range of a nuclear plant.  I'm way more worried about a coal ash spill, lead or mercury poisoning, pesticides or herbicides, car crashes, etc.  I suppose it could be an issue, but I wouldn't treat it as a bigger concern than those others. 6) I'll take a job in a volcano at this point. (x2!) 7) Driving a small car rather than a midsize is thousands of times more likely to kill you than a nuclear accident. Similarly, average life expectancy of inhabitants of Harriburg PA was reduced by an average of 2 min. by the Three Mile Island incident. I wouldn't worry about it. Statistically, the stress will take off more years of life expectancy than the nuclear plant.8) Hmm. I would agree but if there is an accident, you're toast (and you probably won't find out until it's too late, if at all with Trump and his people running things). Just look at what a politcally motivated and underfunded and ill-staffed FEMA did during and after Hurricane Katrina. 9) thanks everyone for the diverse responses 10) Saw this article today and thought about this convo...  ","Got thrown back into the academic job search unexpectedly. Been trying to hack out some applications but I'm probably dead in the water this year. Wish this industry job would've died in December instead of January, I'm afraid I'm not going to ever get a gig that I want. Oh, and this will be season number 4 in terms of academic jobs. Why does this suck so much? I have papers in PNAS and Nature Biotech, damnit, I produce solid science! What is the problem?!   2) Feel the same way. 3) Yup, this sucks. I have more papers in good journals than most of my mentors had at tenure, but no job...not sure what more I can do. 4) to 3, are you sure? I am not trying to judge, but want to say that if you have more papers than tenured professor but have no job, it is likely that one or two factors play a role in SC decision. Good luck on the job search. 5) It's also not particularly informative to compare the record of a postdoc of today with any tenured faculty member. Things are different now than they were then, and you're usually not competing against the old fart with tenure but with other amazingly promising postdocs with records that are every bit as good x4 3) I'm quite sure. Of course I also know that times have changed and I'm not competing against tenured profs. I'm mainly just frustrated with what feels like a very long holding period before moving into a permanent position (and I actually have loved my postdocs apart from the constant uncertainty about the future). For the record, I didn't make that comment to imply that I think I'm any better of a scientist than the mentors I was referencing; many of them are quite amazing scientists. A big part of the reason that I have more publications at this career stage is that many of them moved into tenure track jobs after just a year of two of a postdoc and their time early on was more evenly split between teaching, research, mentoring, and applying for grants. This is the venting tab after all. 6) If inclined to respond to venting on a perfectly legitimate topic with ""It's not particularly informative ..."" just go somewhere else. Start a ""picking a fight"" tab and argue til you're blue in the face. 7) to #3, also if you have been postdoc-ing for too long, you might have ""aged out"" of the market... 8) Great job policing the venting tab Clouseau. 5) The very point of this wiki is to learn things, hence the importance of lessons that are actually relevant and, in the case of venting, legitimate. A postdoc complaining that they have more pubs than a tenured prof is one of the silliest complaints I've ever seen here. x3 9) x3ing your own post is sillier. 10) please 9, let's be adults here. 11) I would not be upset at tenured profs having less pubs than me. The job market have changed since those folks got their position. I guess I am more upset that people who are fresh out of their PhD, and only have two papers but got the job over me because of ""future potential"". Makes working so hard for that Nature or PNAS paper a waste of time because it takes a long time to get those papers. x2. 12) spot on, 11. Going for the newbie with 'potential' goes against everything we're taught about the importance of productivity, and feels a lot like awarding medicrity (but of course there's a lot more to it than the number of pubs). I wonder, if the academic job market were like natural selection, would going for a newbie with potential really be favored over going with an established entity who has demonstrated that they have the good genes that confer high survivorship? I think not. 13) @5, don't come to the venting page to lecture people. You're assuming they want to hear your opinion and that you have information they haven't heard before. This process sucks. People who want advice will ask for it, and those who want to vent about it will come here. Take it easy on our colleagues here. 4) 4 again here. I wanted to add a few points here. What I meant is that if you think your publication record is very good but no job, there might be somthing wrong. It will be great if you can fix it. For example, if you don't have interviews while your record is strong, then something might be wrong with your reference letters, or that you have been a postdoc for too long (especially folks who graduated around 2009), or that your publication is not focused. If none of these factors apply to you, then you might want to check your research statement. If you have had many interviews but no job, then think about how to improve your interview skills. Again, good luck! 14) For broad context on the research productivity and years of experience of newly-hired TT asst. profs of ecology in N. America, see https://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2017/10/17/a-crude-statistical-profile-of-the-research-productivity-of-recently-hired-tt-n-american-ecology-faculty/ and https://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2018/01/04/when-did-newly-hired-n-american-tt-ecology-faculty-get-their-phds/comment-page-1/. Short version: publication records and experience levels of new hires vary a lot. But almost nobody gets hired to a tenure-track ecology faculty position, even at an undergrad-only college, with just one or two publications, or fresh out of a PhD without doing a postdoc (though neither is *totally* unheard of). 15) Is it just me? I feel like 3 interviewees used to be the standard, now more like 4-5. What's up with this? Kind of annoying.","SLAC schools and waiting Had my interview conclude with the Dept. head telling me that they'd let me know ""in a week or two"" about a decision being made. There was one more candidate coming through later that week, then the decision would be made. If the last candidate came through on a Friday, how soon would people think that I could hear if I was first choice? What about if I wasn't? 1) I'd say after a week, you likely weren't the first choice. Though you never really know until you know -- welcome to the anxiety of waiting and congratulations on getting an interview. 2) varies by institutions... I've heard in less than a week after the department voted from some places, and not for 2-3 weeks for others if they have a lot of HR hurdles to jump through prior to making an offer 3) I don't know much about SLACs, but over-promising on hiring timelines is common in academic hiring... 4) I am in the same boat as the OP. Interviewed, they said another candidate is visiting the next week then they hope to have a decision 1-2 weeks after. The week after the second candidate I received an email update saying they are hoping to have a meeting the following week and will be in touch afterwards. That meeting should have been last week. I really liked the SLAC and would be extremly happy if I end up there so the wait is terrible...","And the median initial job offer on the Negotiations page is still only $63,500... 2) if it makes you feel any better, the median of accepted offers is currently $70,000 3) Thanks for the update OP 4) Sad thing is that my expectations have dropped so much (or desperation increased so much) that I would be happy with $63500 even if cost of living is high... 5) One thing to note is that a lot of salaries posted are 9-month salaries (although no new professors that I know work just 9 months). You can make up the remaming 3 months worth of (summer) salary by getting a grant and paying youself or teaching summer courses. 6) except the discussion thread where many people said they work for free in the summer doing course prep and didn't get grants to pay their salary. x2 7) The pay is insulting for sure, but I would also add that the work is more demeaning and precarious in the Gen-Z college environment 8) <-----This. The Coddling of the American Mind by Jonathan Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt is a must read if you want to understand Generation Z at university. 9) I agree with all of this, but do note when comparing salaries between post-docs and professorships that professorships come with considerable benefit upgrades in retirement, health coverage, etc... I'm currently paying $1,000/month to cover health insurance fees as a post-doc. That will go down to ~$250/month as a faculty member. Plus 10% of your salary goes into retirement funds. 10) That doesn't match my experience, but maybe because I am a postdoc at big university? Either way $1000 a month for health insurance is criminal, I hope you have a successful job search! 11) My health insurance costs would go up on the professorship I've been offered vs what I am paying as a postdoc.  And I've just recently qualified for retirement matching contributions from my postdoc.  Your mileage may vary. 12) My health care costs went up to ~$800/month when I got a foreign postdoc fellowship to take up at my US university. Basically the university bumped me off of their university health plan because I was being paid from an external source (i.e. no longer university employee). I negotiated with my advisor to pay me $800/month to cover the health insurance. 13) Yikes, I can;t believe how poor some of your post-doc coverage is. $95 / month for PPO family coverage at my university after employer 95% contribution.  14) As a postdoc, I pay ~$25 / month as a single person; the university pays an additional ~$405 / month for medical+pharmacy, and an additional $20 for dental.  The faculty position offer I have would mean me paying ~$130 / month as a single person, with the university paying a further ~$450.  For slightly worse coverage, given my specifics.  It really is variable from institution to institution. 15) in my last post doc position I had free health insurance plus the uni kicked in 8% retirement... 16) Yea, I think it's far from a given that benefits will be better as a faculty vs. post-doc, esp. if you postdoc at a large university and are faculty at a smaller school","What to negotiate? I got a phone call offering me a position; nothing in writing yet.  The stated percentages of the job in different categories place about twice as much emphasis on teaching as research.  Financial stuff (salary, start up, moving costs, maybe summer support) is all very typical to negotiate.  Is it inherently crazy of me to consider negotiating the start date (which also hasn't been specified yet)?  I have funding for another semester -- probably even another year, though I don't know that for certain yet -- and I'd be in a much better position to both step into teaching courses I haven't taught before, and get my research program up and running quickly at a new place, if I had a little more time to prepare.  I could also more completely wrap up the research I'm not planning to take with me.  It's not like I can't do these things by the end of the summer, just that it would be easier with a little extra time.  In a bigger school, that would seem very simple to ask for.  In a smaller one, where I'm likely to be teaching 4 courses over the first year, I wonder if even asking would be just tone deaf. 2) I think negotiating start dates is totally normal and honestly expected at a lot of places. I've been on a few R1 interviews and they all seemed to expect me to want to push my start date back. Not sure if the same is true across other schools but that's my experience. Have a skype date with the chair so you can get a feel for where there is wiggle room (this also feels less confrontational than doing in all via email), then they can even update your initial offer letter based on this conversation (e.g. to include a later start date).   3) I pushed back my start date an entire year, as did the next hire after me at my institution.  With no complaints from the Chair in either case.  I think it is usually not a big deal unless you are expected to teach a required course starting that semester, in which case your absence means that they will have to get another prof to cover for you or that they will have to hire a stipend instructor. 4) Negotiated delays are very common at R1s and bigger universities, but I know that some small schools (even very highly ranked small schools) will not budge on start date because they need the classes covered. Worth asking though! 5) OP here.  This is at an R2; MS but no PhD program in the department (though a PhD program in an overlapping area). ~15 faculty in the department. 6) You can also ask for release time from teaching your first (or second, or third) years; IME that's common at R2's w/ combination of teaching + research 6) Negotiation tips here, focused on R1 and R2 positions. Covers teaching relief and start date: https://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2017/03/01/tips-for-negotiating-salary-and-startup-for-newly-hired-tenure-track-faculty/  7) I once asked whether start date was negotiable for an R1 job offer (note - only WHETHER it was negotiable, we did not even get to the point of ACTUAL negotiations).  Radio silence for several days, I emailed back to ask if they'd gotten the last email, and was informed the job had already been offered to the next candidate and the offer to me was rescinded.  When the faculty found out, they voted no-confidence in that acting Dean and he was demoted, but nevertheless the job was gone.  so ""the worst they can say is no"" is not ALWAYS the worst that can happen! 8) @7: that's a terrible story, how awful! But there's nothing you could've done to avoid it, surely? I mean, surely the suggestion isn't that nobody should ever try to negotiate on anything, lest the Dean do something crazy like rescind the offer for no good reason and with no notice? 9) Well, that's frankly terrifying.  Wonderful. x2  10) 7 again - this acting Dean was a total mess for the Dept aside from my situation, seemed to have no idea that candidates were allowed to negotiate, and was certainly incompetent in handling my entire offer.  But, it does show how crazy things sometimes are behind the scenes and entirely independent of the candidates.  It all ended up working out for the best- now their 2nd choice person has a TT job, and I got a TT job in a much more desirable location (the next year). 10) I negotiated a delayed start date at a teaching-focused position this year. What helped is that we made a case to the admin saying that keeping the current VAP teaching my classes for another year would cost the school less than I would (I don't agree that this should be the case, but realistically it is). It was not easy to get the delayed start (and might have ruffled some feathers) but I was also very clear how the delay would benefit both my teaching and research at the university and even wrote up a document outlining how it would do so. 11) Sorry 7. I had a similar experience of a job offer being yanked. It was a big blow. I agree that people are wrong when they advise ""the worst they can say is no"" , but I also don't want to reward bad behavior by having candidates being fearful to ask (not that you were saying that). Now that I'm on the other side I have seen how much the process is driven by personalities. Don't assume that everyone (the Chair, the faculty, the admin) is competent or rational. They can screw things up because they're jerks or have no idea how things are suppose to work.  12) On the financial side, I'm trying to strike the balance of ""No, really, I actually need this essential equipment to do the research that I said I was going to do in my research statement and talk, so if you don't have it in shared facility space then I need to buy it"" and not asking for so much more than they told me to aim for in the startup that I cause everything to collapse. 13) OP -- ended up turning the offer down.  They just didn't have the resources to let me set up the lab, and they weren't flexible on anything other than the salary -- start date, relocation expenses, start up, etc.  I explained that these things had made me really hesitant, and that I felt I should be excited about starting a position, not apprehensive, particularly since I have funding for another year.  The chair was actually very understanding, and said that they had one other candidate who'd be acceptable, but if the search failed they'd repost it next year and would love to have me if circumstances changed.","45 apps submitted so far. Received 7 rejections. I haven't heard from the rest. My current position ends in June. My visa is contingent on having a job. This is highly stressful. We have the terminal degree in our respective fields and it shouldn't be so unimaginably tough to get a job. In the meantime, my friend who has a bachelor's degree in chemical engg earns $300,000 in his tech job. I am not wishing for more money or prestige or fame or any of the other fancy things. Neither am I demeaning my friend's abilities. All I am saying is that it shouldn't be this stressful and difficult to stay in academia. My partner is American. We have already been living apart for the past year and the prospect of having to go back to my home country if unemployed is just too effin' stressful. It almost makes me unproductive in my current position. I appreciate this community and am thankful for a safe space to vent. 2) Good luck, I feel your pain. I lived apart from my partner for 7 years because of stuff like that... 3) I comiserate, doing the long distance (or trading off lagging partner) has been super tough for us too. I don't really follow the logic of we all have terminal degrees therefore it should be easier to get a job - that's not the case for many academic fields. For my part, I wish Eco/Evo graduate programs were more up front about the fate of their PhD graduates and how difficult it is financially/emotionally to try and get a TT job. X2 4) Yep, all of this. Good luck #1. 5) My advisor told me many many many times how difficult and financially/emotionally draining the job market in academia was. I guess there was a level of naivness in me and didn't really listen or undnerstand what they meant until now. 6) My advisors were all pretty honest about this too, but among my main mentors one got a job straight from grad school (no postdoc), two got jobs in <2 years of postdoc, and the last managed to solve two body problem with dream jobs after a slightly longer postdoc. I think the reality is that it is very hard for people who didn't go through long and arduous searches to understand the stress and uncertainty that many people experience on the job market even if they are trying to pay attention and be good advisors.  [Comments deleted - don't be a jerk] 7) Hang on. It is both scary and comforting that we all go throught the same process (for the most part). 8) 45 apps? You must be a generalist. I don't see anywhere near 45 research jobs that could be described as being in fields like ""ecology"" or ""evolution"", which themselves are pretty broad. 9) I agree that 45 seems like a lot (I only found 15 evolution jobs to apply for this year) and it's still early enough that you may still get something this year. 10) I applied for around 35 myself, had 70 on my list at one point in time, and am not necessarily a generalist, but more integrative; My work can be interpreted in many different ways. Think there are a lot of people like that. It's all in how you sell yourself. 11) It is probably because #1 was faking all of it like I suggested earlier to gain sympathy while sounding vain (the AP called me a jerk and deleted by comments). As #8 rightly pointed out, there were nowhere close to 45 research jobs. I continue to find this post insulting. Yet, my comments are deleted for speaking the truth.12) I have applied to 24 and have completely ignored SLACs and PUIs as well as all international jobs and some entire regions of the US. I think 45 is not unreasonable at all. 13) If you work in any area of ecology & evolution and are really going all out on jobs (all geographical locations and instution types) you can easily apply to 45 positions. I know people who are not at all 'generalists' who have applied to 75+ positions in a year. Whether that is advisable or not is another question. Of course it is a huge amount of work and many of those positions will be a big stretch, but it is also really unpredictable which positions will show interest in your application even if they seem like a very good fit. Give it a rest 11. x4  #1) again. Agree with #12 and #13. I would not necessarily qualify myself as a generalist, but my work can be framed in different ways. Of course some of my applications are a stretch, but I think it was worth my effort. I must add that my list also includes a few think-tanks/research centers. 15) #11 again. @1 Bah humbug. 16) I applied to 44, maybe @11 needs to start thinking carefully about how to pitch their own work instead of hating on people venting x2 17) I think 45 is totally reasonable, I have applied to 48. If your work is broad you can fit multiple calls. You just need to know how to market yourself. 18) @17, I have a tough time believing its just about knowing how to market yourself. Do you genuinely believe your research aligned with the 48 jobs you applied? Treating this like a numbers game seems like a waste of your time and the time of people on selection committees. If you don't agree, can you maybe provide an example of a research program that could encompass 48 jobs on this board? 19) Look at the Harvard call on this list, essentially open to all of STEM. Personally I have been responding to calls that seem like I have a realistic shot at an interview because I'm strapped for time. But, I could see how others might find it useful to apply to a broader R1/R2/small college ad in the general realm of eco/evo. 20) Look, not everyone's research program is equally widely marketable. (i'm #16) So I understand if some people can't find more than a handful of places to apply. But don't extrapolate from your personal experience to others, it doesn't always work. 21) The advice I have heard many times is that if the position (even department) is even somewhat related to what you do, it may be worth putting an app in because it isn't unheard of for a committee to bring someone out who they like even if they don't fit the ad. Is it likely? probably not. But it is arguably worth the time it takes to modify a cover letter or whatever else for that chance. x3 22) Has anyone ever heard of someone being offered a TT job they didn't fit? 23) @22, yes I know several people who were offered jobs for calls that were not clear 'fits' on paper and where there were certainly other candidates that were more closely aligned with the written job description. I also think that once you are thinking of applying to R3/masters/LAC or community colleges, there are many more positions that are advertised in a general way or that really focus on 'can you teach these classes' rather than exactly what your research is about. Some people aren't interested in that type of jobs, which if fine, but if you are applying that broadly then 45 is not a stretch at all for any research area in ecology & evolution 24) Right, once you include LACs and other teaching-focused jobs 30+ seems reasonable. There definitely arent 30+ research jobs in the same fields though 25) @23 finding it hard to believe there are departments that dont care about fit. whats the point of a job ad then? 26) If you aren't applying to more than 30 jobs each year you are not going to get a job 23) @25, I don't mean that they don't care about you fitting in the department. But many places have little or no research expectation. Fitting means you can teach the classes that they need covered. Of course you have to be able to demonstrate that you can teach and have an interest in those positions, but the exact sub-sub-field of your publications isn't going to matter much. I agree with 24 that if you are focused solely on jobs that emphasize research you'll have a hard time finding a ton to apply to each year, but those are the minority of professorships in academia. 27)If you apply to 30 or 50 jobs, I'd best most of the time the one you end up getting is the same one you would get if you had only applied to 5. But's that ""what if"" that drives some of us to apply for a bunch more 28) @27, that definitely does not match my experience. If I look at the top 5 jobs that I thought I fit the best in each year over teh last 5 years I've had only 1-2 phone interviews, but I've had ~15 interviews at jobs that I would have ranked my 'fit' around 10-20 on my whole list. There are a lot of reasons for that (e.g., many of those best fit jobs for me were at super prestigious places which I think is a result of my sub-field), but I would have had a very hard time predicting which jobs to apply for if I was only trying to pick the ones I was most likely to get interviews at. You're right that the tail end of my applications (e.g., jobs that I applied to that were a real stretch but in a place I really wanted to live) have not produced many interviews. I've also been surprised that most of the interviews I've had have been in one particular area that I definitely do not consider to be my primary area, so for whatever reason search committees seem to be seeing me differently than I see myself. 29) #27 again, you could be right @22. Sometimes things you aren't expecting come through. But of the 10-15 interviews at jobs you didn't feel yourself as a good fit ahead of time, how many turned into offers? That's more what I'm talking about about. Both my postdoc and my recent faculty job were advertised and I had a feeling that my chances of being offered them were at least 50/50. There were a number of faculty or research jobs that felt like ""perfect fits"" though that I knew would be a crapshoot because they were also perfiect fits for a bunch of people at least as qualified as me (and likely some much more). ","Canceled searches / rescinded offers tab? I am wondering if it makes sense to add a tab for rescinded offers and canceled searches, given the rapidly developing changes in the academic market? I feel like it might be helpful to get a sense for the scope of the effects and to see how different types of institutions are handling it  (x2)  2) Would something like this page cover it?  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KohP4xZdN8BZy1OMeXCAGagswvUOWpOws72eDKpBhI4/edit 3) That document would be so much better if it were a spreadsheet, but it doesn't seem worth duplicating the effort here...4) This information could easily be added to the negotiations tab. Thematically appropriate as well. 5) OP here.  Thanks for sharing the document. Personally, I think it would be well worth having more granular information.  That document doesn't provide much context -- some entries may reflect offers rescinded, some may be blanket hiring freezes, some may be searches suspended for time being, etc.  I think it would be helpful for eco/evo job seekers to know how many people in eco/evo were affected, in what type of positions, at what types of institutions, and how many schools have already announced blanket hiring freezes. I think adding it to the negotiations tab could work, but many people who just had offers rescinded may not think to look there. Just one postdoc's opinion. 6) maybe we can just color code the original listing on the jobs pages with a Yellow for ""search on hold"" and orange for ""search cancelled"" Red for ""offer recinded"". 7) I think by far the bigger and most relevant effect for most of us will be on next year(s) job market.  AP) To keep it simple, just add that info to the Notes column on the main page. We'll only have reliable info on a subset of the relevant cases, so there's probably no need for a tab or special color-coding (if there are a bunch added, we can revisit).8) There are more and more searches being cancelled because of the pandemic. I think it would be interesting to color code the spreadsheet and get a sense of how wide spread it is. As an example, I had 7 on-campus interview this year, and at least 3 have been cancelled so far... sounds like a fourth one is about to be cancelled...9) could you clarify? what was canceled, the visit, or an offer? 10) Do you think hiring freezes are coming down the line due to COVID19? I bet there's going to be a big retention issue with students no longer being on campus. 11) Has anyone actually had an offer rescinded because of the pandemic? 11) @10 people have posted on the Karen Kelsky document that shows hiring freezes and such that some offers have been rescinded 12) I imagine there is a lot of uncertainty in many schools with budgets. I know some scholarships linked to endowments are not being offered because of stock market volatility. If the economy really continues into recession though, it might mean an increase in enrollment for some schools (similar to the surge after 2008 great recession (school as an alternative to looking for work). 13) Seems like a good idea. I'm at UNC and they're all enering a hiring freeze (unless with dean approval) 14) 8 here. On-campus interviews happened, and now they cannot proceed with the search and make an offer until the freeze is lifted. 15) OP here, I'm toggling the mod flag here in the hopes that one of the mods can make one of the suggested changes. I think it would be very useful to have some kind of accounting of which searches actually successfully completed.  AP) @15 The best way to implement this isn't clear, and I definitely don't have time to go through and tag every entry, but here's an idea: if you want to tag a search, add in the Notes column [[SEARCH CANCELLED]], [[ON HOLD]] or [[OFFER RESCINDED]] (use the double brackets).  I added three Filter Views that will then filter on these phrases.  Could add more tags if y'all want. 16) Thanks I appreciate it  AP) No problem. If y'all want this to be useful, someone should go through and add these tags. 17) I wish I could but I only know hearsay and second hand info, and only for a handful of searches.  18) The filter options seem to work poorly (at least on my machine).  Several searches are marked as cancelled but don't show up in the filter view as of 4/18/2020  AP) @18 whoops, thanks, fixed that. 19) Thanks!"
Utah State University Any news out there on the status of the physical geography./aquatic ecologist position? 1) Interview decisions have been made and those candidates have been contacted.,U Mississippi What happened? ,NA,NA,NA,"SIUE Env Tox (moved from comments on vacancies page) 1) could be nothing. It also could be a sign of an adm. that does not want to pay benefits or start up to a lot of faculty. Don't know if it's germane, but when I was a CC student we had 12 full time TT faculty. After a few years most retired and they were replaced by adjuncts. The adm didn't want to pay benefits (and didn't have to for part time faculty). 2) Anecdotally, more and more schools are replacing tenure lines with adjuncts. It saves admins money, but is one of the main reasons why it's getting harder and harder for us to find TT jobs.  3) the school either can't afford permanent staff, the department had a pile of retirements at one time making it difficult to run searches simultaneously, the department might be an after thought in the university, the leadership/department are incapable of fighting for what they want.  Any of those could be true. You must ask the right questions to get the answers you want. 4)  Admin like to get rid of FT faculty, then replace them with FT admin who further reduce the workload and raise costs.

","email after phone inteview? When you start talking about the timeline for decision-making stuff at the end of an interview, how much do you say about what else you might have going on?  Is it better if they think you have other options, or does that give them an excuse to go with someone else?  Any advantages or disadvantages on either side? 2) I told them at the offer stage I had another upcoming interview. I was actually invited for interview at another place the night after my interview at the place I got the offer, so I didn't know during the interview. However, I personally wouldn't mention it during the interview unless directly asked. I did mention it at the offer stage to help my case about upping salary, research start-up, and moving a little. Ended up with a strong offer and I loved the place when I visited, so I cancelled the other interview and accepted the offer. 3) it's hard to tell, but it might help if you phrase it right. You may say that you have another option, but this place (where you are being interview) seems to be a much better fit for you and you would prioritize it if they give you an offer.",Do HR/University have a perference of a candidate being or not being married?!,"Being a VAP 1) Sincere, naive question here: How can one manage to be a visiting professor somewhere? The positions advertised seem to be 9-month deals that would leave one stranded for a quarter of the year with regard to salary and health insurance. I understand why someone would take the job for professional reasons, I just don't understand how a person survives it. I'm assuming it's as bad as I think it is and people just suffer the consequences. 2) Nearly all academic positions are 9 months, so it's the same: your 9 month salary is divided into 12 portions and paid out, with health and other benefits occuring year round. Yes, the pay is less than an assistant professor at the same institution, but its usually about what a 12 month post-doc makes. And just like assistant professors, you are supposed to work on research 100% during the summer. 3) Plus a lot of VAPs (certainly not all) are longer than one year. OP) Thanks for the feedback. I had assumed benefits were only available during the duration, not for a full calendar year.","Not sure why I keep checking back on those jobs for which the wiki says some received rejections a months ago, others were interviewed two weeks ago, and on campus interviews have been arranged, but I have heard nada. I guess those who received rejections were those filtered out by HR rather than the SC? ABDs, perhaps? And the rest of us won't hear anything unless it's after they've made a final selection, even though we have no chance. 2) Food for thought: https://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/gradhacker/not-knowing-why-i-avoided-academic-jobs-wiki","Staying extra days for a campus interview?  So I have a campus interview coming up in a city where I have friends, family, and collaborators. I'm doing the bookings and getting reimbursed. The interview will be on a Friday, and I'll stay in a hotel near the campus the night before, but I'd like to spend a couple days doing research and meeting with folks while I'm there, on my own dime of course. I'm guessing I must be upfront about this (they'll see the booking details of the flight eventually), but as it actually saves them a couple hundred dollars to have more than one day between flights, will it look bad to do this? Advice here suggests that it does look bad(http://theprofessorisin.com/2014/02/07/dr-karens-rules-of-the-campus-visit/), although there's some dispute in the comments. Thoughts?  2) Interesting.  I had the same idea for one of my interviews and decided to just go for the interview because I too was worried about how it would look.  I got the offer for what it's worth. 3) Here is what I would do: pay for a one way flight in and pay for a one way flight out. Turn the one way flight in for reimbursement. Tell the Administrative Assistant that you have family/friends to visit in the area and will pay your own way back home. The end. To me, whether it saves the university money or not, they agreed to fly you in for an interview and fly you out after the interview. Once you break from that plan, you are on your own. 4) This isn't unusual or a big deal. Just ask whoever you're working with how to arrange it. The department should pay for your ticket to/from and hotel during the interview. The rest is up to you. The department should see it as a positive indicator that you are interested in the area. 5) Friend of mine spent an extra couple days after an interview to visit family in the area- and was offered the job, and the search committee told him that was actually the tie-breaker- his investment in the area. 6) OP here - I emailed the chair to see if it's alright! I've talked to a few people about it, and the response has either been 'meh', 'it shows an interest/investment in the area', or 'well, ask and see what they say' 7) Good luck!!! Every search committee is different so you will probably never know the right answer (until perhaps you get an offer). 8) I've done extended visit to city where interview was, due to time zones. The search committee wouldn't have had a chance to see the booking details before making a decision given the timing. 9) I did that on one and they were super enthusiastic about it.  Committee liked not having to worry about whether I'd turn them down on lifestyle. FTR I hate my family and had no desire to live near them. Really it's bullshit that anyone's job is dependent on where extended family members live.  Nothing to do with qualifications as a scientist or willingness to join a dept.  If you're on a search committee, shut those conversations down.  They are prejudiced. 10) Unless the institution has rules to the contrary, just ask for your flight to be booked to accommodate your dates. We have done it for multiple job candidates in the past. 11) OP here! They did not seem to mind. 12) The chair of the SC I had a Skype interview with last week was the one who suggested I could extend my stay - it's far away. 13) @9, I disagree, SC is usually keen to know someone wants to be at their institution, and so any sort of local connection (either research-related or not) is a good thing. It definitely is one (of many) factors considered.  Last thing we want to do is hire someone who'll be miserable here and constantly complaining in faculty meeting, then cut and run as soon as they have a haflway decend offer elsewhere.  Fit matters.  14) I did it for an international search (I was abroad, coming back to states, first time in that state. I think it worked against me. I think they considered it unprofessional and out of the ordinary. There could be up or downsides, but I trust The Professor is In in these things, I would never do it again.

Do I need to have a personal website at this stage? 2) I would say so. People will be googling you and it gives you a chance to help control what they see. I get lots of website visits that seem to be associated with the job hunt. 3) Yes. The day papers hit journals you get tons of hits - people can put a face to your name. Link to your advisor's site, get more hits. When you apply for jobs, every place that gives you a look will visit your site because they want to see more about you. I suggest weebly, no html necessary, just drag and drop and you can make a site in a few hours time, totally free 4) I agree 100% - in this day, having a usable website is better than buisness card. You should also create a profile in Google Scholar and link any publications. That is an easy way for committees to easily find and read your pubs. 5) I don't think you need a personal website, just use Google Scholar, ORCID, ResearchGate, etc. 6) I find it very useful to have a website with google analytics - I have gotten a lot of action from schools where I've applied or interviewed x3 7) I really like wordpress.com, but the only downside is you can't do google analytics with it, so you can't see where within a country your hits are coming from. 8) @7 I didn't think you could either but after some searching there are plugins that make adding Google Analytics easy. At your WordPress plugins page search for google anlaytics, I picked the first one, ""Google Analytics Dashboard for WP"", because it already had a lot of reviews. So far it works great. 9) Analytics works for any website you can write code in, i.e. any website you have creative control of. 10) yes, and analytics is very easy to set up with Weebly if you want to go in that direction 11) @8 thanks for the tip. When I go to WP plugins it says I need to have a business plan to use plugins. @9 I also can't alter the code w/o a business plan...bummer! 12) Try Wix! I use it and it has a used marketplace for plugins. 8 again. Sorry, I didn't realize it was a business plan only option. I started my website for a small business that I had prior to going back for my PhD. I sold the business and the annual fee for the hosting account was reasonable so I just kept it, got a new domain name, and created the personal website. I did a  Google search for ""Wordpress google analytics without business account"" and there are ways to do it without a busniess account, but it looks like it will take a bit of coding yourself.","Been on the market for 3 years and this year there is finally *finally!* an ad that could truly be custom made for me. But of course it's in the one part of the country that I (& my parnter) have zero desire to live in. I'll still apply and I probably won't get an interview so it probably doesn't even matter. 2) Same situation #1, been on the market for 4 years and had two ads that I felt would definitely land me an interview but got passed on both. But landed an interview at another uni where I didn't think I would even be considered. Job searching in this market is so strange x 6. 3) There was an ad I applied for back in September that had a lot of very specific requirements that I happened to fit all of and was super excited about. I never heard a word from them. I just got an offer from a school where I kind of had to contort myself to argue that I fit the description, and in a location I am deeply averse to, so I have to imagine I didn't seem as enthusiastic as I otherwise would, though the actual job sounds quite promising. This whole system is so much more random than I think most people are comfortable talking about. x4 4) Absolutely, #3. I didn't get one interview for the perfect fit ads but then got hired on for a position that I don't resemble at all. This was ten years ago, so definitely not something new!! 5) How do you feel about your job now? Any regrets? 5) 4 again...I love everything about my job except the courses that I teach. I don't hate the courses, they just aren't my cup of tea. Oddly enough, I have the courses down so well now that I doubt I would switch over to the courses that fit my research, even if given the option to do so. I find the whole hiring process amusing b/c I have checked who got hired over me for the ads that fit me perfectly, and half of those people didn't fit the job ad at all. There were probably people saying the same thing about me when I was hired. It all makes more sense when you are on the hiring side of things. Department decides what the ad should say, but then a subset of faculty pick the campus interviewees, and that subset may have a different idea of what they want versus the collective department. At that point the department is left to pick between three people that may only loosely fit the original job ad. 6) Thanks for telling us!","Diversity resources Useful resources: https://ofew.berkeley.edu/recruitment, from twitter: https://twitter.com/NeedhiBhalla/status/1070092730682945536, https://extramural-diversity.nih.gov/ 2) Thanks!!","I switched fields for my postdoc and I can't help but feel like it's hurt me in job season. I thought I did a good job of pulling it all together into a coherent story, but based on the results so far I think I grossly underestimated how hard it would be to do that. There are a lot of other factors at play that are out of my control for sure, but it still is incredibly frustrating! Anyone else switch fields and feel similarly?  2) Actually they often fault you  more often for staying in the same field than if you diversified.  What can you do with your combination of skills that other people cannot do?  Can you apply population genetics to virus evolution?  Can you combine field ecology with CRISPR to find the genetic basis of adaptive phenotypes and relate those to niches?  Focus on how your training can fit together in future research.  That's a better way to build coherence than trying to unite to disparate past roles.  Whatever the theme is, you want to repeat it over and over when you draft your research statement.  Every section should repeat that theme at the beginning or end.  It's even more important to show how you are tying things together than if you have a postdoc that clearly appeared from your PhD work. A similar approach will help if you are applying for a job that sort of fits with your work but isn't pefectly matched.    xxxxNot really that venty.  This could be moved to general discussion.xxxx 3) Based on your x's it might be more suitable for NSFW page. 4) OP, I am in a similar boat as you and feel the same way. Turns out that when departments and higher ups say that they want ""interdisciplinary"" folks, they really mean that they want interdisciplinary projects--i.e. folks to collaborate across fields, rather than someone who can do it all. At least that's how it feels! But, still holding out hope this was a good move career-wise. 5) Agree with #4 about projects > your abilities. I personally can do 2 things where basically no one in the world is as capable at both, but there are papers that have both topics by collaboration. I'm getting destroyed on the market because of the people who leveraged that and have more papers due to not investing the time to learn both fields. 6) In the same situation with changing research topics in a way that makes it hard to put them all together despite having lots of good publications. A disproportionate amount of people I know personally who got jobs really quickly/easily had very coherent and linear research programs. I think it is just easy for search committees to envision what those peoples labs would be focused on so they make it through easier at least to the interview stage. 7) I've noticed this too. People who get hired often seem to be extending their PhD work. 8) re:7 But then again there are a lot of people extending PhD work who don't get hired. Not a lot of info available and can't take good or bad outcomes in job market as indicators of anything imo 9) I agree with #8. I've seen a fair number of people even get hired and start their labs in animal systems they have never worked with previously (postdoc or phd)! I personally find that kind of wild, though. 10) If it's a case of applying techniques they've already used to a new system, that can still be an ""extension"" of earlier work. 11) I feel you I am in the same spot. The cost us high, but it can be also a big plus if you manage to get it into a coherent story: you can better interact with faculty members from different biological disciplines, you don't step on so many toes, you can sell yourself as somebody who do outside-of-the-box science and certainly as somebody unique. In my cover letter I always try to be very open about the fact that I have two backgrounds that I am now going to combine to a unique research profile.12) similar boat ugh","Broad vs Narrow Search Hey peeps. I just got out of a faculty meeting where we were discussing the strategy for a search next year. One question was on broad vs narrow search. Would a general search for ""ecology and/or evolution"" keep you from applying compared to a more narrow search like ""plant ecologist"" (if you fit the bill)? Thanks for your thoughts. 2)Do you know what you want? Then ask for it and don't waste the other 100 to 200 people's time. If you really don't know what you want, then search broadly, by all means.  OP) @2 we have multiple needs over the next few years (and of course not everyone has the same priority list). So the debate is to preemptively narrow the scope, or aim broadly to get the best person now. Some were afraid that some folks would not even bother applying for a broad search like ""ecology & evolution"". 3) I would be more likely to apply to a narrower search. I think that would save everyone's time. As you say, there are certain needs even for broad searches, so be explicit about those. 4.) I agree with #3, I am more likely to apply to a narrower search. 5) Also more likely to apply for a narrow search. Tell your faculty to make up their mind. If there are really multiple needs at least describe those few areas rather than just all of ecology and evolution.x6 6) Earlier on I applied to broad calls, now I'm limited on time and not applying to them. I absolutely prioritized narrow/specific calls in my field 7) Are folks really that picky? I apply to everything, broad or narrow. But I do take more time to tailor my materials to narrow searches. 8) SCs don't always know what they want or sometimes can't agree on what they want. Although I agree that it is preferable to post a narrow job search if that's what a place really, truly is going to want to hire, I can also appreciate a broad search that might allow me to fit well somewhere for reasons the SC might not have foreseen. I wouldn't mind a broad search if the SC was truly open to that.  OP) Thanks for the feedback everyone.  I'm sort of surprised a general search is offputting to so many; I thought people were applying widely.  @8 yes, the idea is that we would honestly consider everyone and be open to a match we hadn't anticipated.  That and DEI issues are the main motivation to go broader.  But I'll bring everyone's perspectives to our next meeting. 3 again) Ah, if DEI issues are a priority, make sure the materials you request reflect that (e.g., don't make the diversity statement optional, or half the length of other documents)   9) I also would prefer a narrow search. Yes, OP, I and many others are applying to broad searches too. But such searches are more frustrating from our perspective. A narrow search communicates that, if you have some overlapping expertise, you should apply. A broad search communicates that maybe there are multiple hirings possible, maybe the committee doesn't know what they want, maybe the faculty can't agree on anything and are just hoping for the best, or whatever. If you really do have several lines opening up over the next few years, then prioritize and get some at least slightly narrower ads out. The faculty will have to come to a consensus at some point, so put the effort in and come to one a little sooner in the process, and save all of us some time. 10) Strong agree with 9. While some searches might truly be broad, mostly what it communicates to me is that rather than spending their own time really deciding what they want the committee is foisting off work to hundreds of applicants. Of course I still apply to the broad searches, but it is really common to apply to those and then see that all five invited applicants are in the same subfield far from anyting I do. Really hard in that situation not to feel like the committee just wasted my time and letter writers time for no reason. 11) I agree that targeted searches are better, but if you do end up going with a broad search, please for the love of all that is holy do not ask for rec. letters up front. 12) I've applied to a few broad searches where I knew committee members.  After the committee saw applications, they/the faculty apparently decided they wanted a more narrow topic than what they'd listed for. In one case this benefited me, in the other 2 it definitely did not.  But it was frustrating in all cases - wish faculty would decide what they want, and not choose topic / focus areas *after* listing positions. 13) Your search has been cancelled  OP) @13, we hope to escape our university's hiring chill, but we'll see how that goes. If not, see yall in fall 2021.14) just saw this. I'm pro broad search. I'm of the opinion no one actually knows what they want until they see it. 15) I am also pro-broad search but, if at all possible, request letters after you make your cut. I've had better success in broad searches because my work crosses disciplinary boundaries. 16) I do interdisciplinary science, some of which can be considered plant biology. I shy away from ""Plant Ecologist"" advertisements because I'm a lot broader than that and I worry I won't be the right fit. 17) What are all these ""if you dont know what you want, search broadly"" comments? As if departments are checklists of disciplines they are trying to cover. This is not the only reason to search broadly."
"UOP (University of the Pacific) I'm bitter about UOP. What a freakin' waste of time! I put so much time into preparing, planning, and traveling for this interview. And it would be one thing if they had chosen someone else in our group of 3 as more qualified, or a better fit. But I feel like rejecting all 3 candidates that this really reflects poorly on them. We had phone interviews AND campus interviews! In this job market, they should have spent more time looking through the oodles of applications they received more carefully and selecting people with a better fits prior to the interview stage.  1)I have to agree - how can a SC be so clueless that they select not one, but three people, based on applications, LoR's and phone interviews, and still not like any of them upon meeting them in person? Seriously, I can't believe that three people in a row bombed interviews. The only thing I can guess is that there is a total disconnect between the SC and the rest of the department. OP, if that is the case, than you may have dodged a bullet there. 
2) I'm with you guys. I was outright rejected (no phone interview), but after seeing this, I'm okay with that. This puts up a big red flag to me. To the OP (or others who interviewed there) - did you get the sense of any type of dysfunctionality, hostility, or divisiveness when you interviewed? I have no vested interest, but this is a venting page and I'm curious. (3) Don't assume that they (who is UOP?) simply didn't find a candidate in this year....I would suspect that they pushed the search through to beat a loss of funding, got all of the interviews done and then got the position pulled by the admin. This is the most likely scenario. (4) Except that evidently they are continuing to interview. (5) You never know what goes on behind the scenes. For all we know, the Dean could have vetoed the SC's top choices. 
6) Clearly, the search committee is at fault here, and it has nothing to do with the candidates themselves. Right?
7) #1 here - #6, the only way that could happen is if the SC is incompetent and selected candidates based on things like number of publications and research awards, rather than teaching experience and teaching awards. Which, again, comes down to what I wrote - a clueless SC, or a disconnect between what the SC and the department. I can't believe that three candidates who were chosen for teaching experience would ALL bomb on their teaching demonstrations.
8) Yes, when people are invited for an interview, you MUST hire one of them, or you are clearly incompetent, no matter what the candidates turn out like in person if you do not choose one of your first 3 choices
9) Ouch. (10) I don't understand how a search committee can invite three candidates and 2/3 of them have error filled teaching presentations. I didn't apply for this post, but it just strikes me as odd! I can only recall a single interviewee providing blatantly incorrect info in a presentation after serving on many search committees, but bad luck for UOP I guess. will they 
(11) OP, YOu got BURNED by an obvious SC member B-U-R-N-E-D!
(12) Way harsh, #6/#8. Are you on the SC? Perhaps the candidates are better off not being your colleague. [end comment 12 - I did not write the next part and am annoyed that someone is trying to make it look like I did.] (12.5) You should have taken the unwarranted criticism by the OP without any comments or corrections to their baseless and imbittered criticism.
(13) How are mistakes by the candidates 6/8's fault? #1 practically extracted the details with a pair of pliers. Maybe s/he shouldn't have revealed so much for the sake of the candidates' dignity, but s/he and the rest of the SC can't be blamed for mistakes, not matter how rare they are. It's not like they provided a lecture script with errors in it. I have to believe the SC picked people that seemed competent (and therefore the SC is probably not incompetent), but mistakes can't be detected on a cv. Is it rare for 3 people to crack under the pressure of an interview and screw up their lecture...maybe. But, unless you're calling 6/8 and the rest of the SC liars, it seems like it happened.
14) Why do any of you think that the SC would want to continue or re-do a search unless they felt it was absolutely necessary...that's a lot of extra work and grief for no reason don't you think? Especially if one of the original 3 were at least ""good enough"".
(15) 12 again - I didn't say it was 6/8's fault that the candidates weren't good, nor did I say that 6/8 was a liar. I'm saying that it was an unnecessarily rude comment to post on the wiki. Also rude for someone to edit my comment. Stop being douchebags, people. 16) Not to be rude but one question I have is whether the 'errors' in the lectures were true errors or differences in interpretation. For example, some of my older profs believe certain things to be ""true"" that have been shown to be either not really the best interpretation or not as general as they believe (think r & K selection here, or the extent to which communities are at equilibrium). I don't know the circumstances but it's something to consider, could your candidates be bringing in new perspectives that to you seem far-fetched but represent a new way of thinking about things?
(17) 12.5 sucks! Definitely a douchebag to frame someone for comments they didn't make. How much of a coward do you have to be to be afraid to post your own comments on a totally anonymous wiki, but instead make it seem like someone else did it? Show some guts if you have an opinion. (18) Hmmm... my impression, without knowing any of the details, is that the department at OUP is trying to strike a difficult balance between teaching and research capabilities... Being invited to interview is a huge investment for a candidate, but it does not guarantee a job (we sometimes assumes that it does, because of the prohibitive expense to the search committee of extending a search, but clearly, this is a false assumption). Some egos were wounded, but try not to take it personally. 19) Agreed that it's a difficult process for a search committee but I do question what balance they were trying to strike. Research and teaching need not trade-off and may actually complement each other in many people (some of the best teachers I know are also very productive researchers). The issue is what to look for and how to measure these two areas. It seems the SC did a poor job in filtering that information from the applications, or had some issues in judging the candidates lectures, or just bad luck, hard to say. But two things I'd wonder was what criteria they used to pick applicants (swanky school and fellowships, papers, teaching, what was the balance) and what sort information they gave the candidates for the teaching demo. As someone who showed up at an interview once and was told - oh you'll give a talk to the grad students at lunch (!) - no prior mention of this, the schedule just said 'lunch with grad students', I do sometimes wonder how much information is given to candidates. No one is owed a job but there's no way to interpret this except as a failure by the search committee. They failed to select the right candidates or they failed to evaluate them effectively. It does reflect on the SC. To those that interviewed, I'm so sorry. This may have much more to do with them than you. (Particularly given the nasty thing the SC-person said about their most recent hire above, nice way to talk about a colleague.) (20) Yeah, that was a nasty thing to say about their recent hire. Not very pacific.
(21) Is it that hard to believe that 1 candidate sucked despite his phone-interviewing skill, and 2 others made serious mistakes that the committe (not just an individual) thought were deal-breakers? I can't believe someone said that ""ther's no way to interpret this except as a failure by the search committee."" I guess every time one of us hasn't gotten a job it must have been the committee. Not that someone was better, or we made some mistake. 6/8 shouldn't have said that stuff, but that doesn't mean the 3 candidates were good enough for the job. Nothing personal to them, but that's the way it is. 22) The job of a search committee is to select candidates that meet the institutional needs. If they filtered through >100 apps and selected 3 individuals that they felt they couldn't hire I would say that the committee did indeed fail in its job. Also, the unpleasant comments from someone on the SC or in the dept above about both the candidates and a recent hire would also suggest they've failed in their job to behave as professionals. Or would you argue they 'did a heck of a job'?
23) I agree with you 22. I also think that 6/8's comments are outright unethical and hope that an admin over at UoP sees them. It's a small enough department that it would be pretty easy to narrow it down. 
(24) I certainly wouldn't say they did a heck of a job, but I get the impression that many of the posters here feel that 1 of the candidates should have been chosen...not just should...MUST have been chosen just because they got a campus interview. 19 said no none is owed a job, but I think that many of the posters here disagree with that based on their comments. One thing that clouds the issue is the sheer insanity of 6/8 in saying what s/he said. I don't care if the 3 candidates picked their noses and farted through the whole lecture...don't comment on it here! What could you be thinking?!?!? You all but identified yourself to everyone here and made us all think you are a douchebag (or piss-ant, or wanker, or whatever we're supposed to call you now). You shifted the blame from people who made mistakes (that the SC wouldn't have been able to predict beforehand) and deservedly didn't get the job because of those mistakes to a search committee full of incompetent, unethical assholes who wouldn't make good colleagues anyway. At what point did it seem wise to look at someone's vent on a VENTING PAGE, and punch them directly in the balls (or the female equivalent, if appropriate) in the most public, non-anonymous way possible? I've got an idea...post the candidates names. That's really all you have left to complete your ignorant behavior. I'm willing to defend the SC as a whole because if people screw up the interview, they shouldn't get the job no matter how much they were screened prior to that mistake. But your actions make it impossible to defend you personally. 25) Nicely said 24! The only thing we should remain careful about though is - was it really the SC? I assumed it was but have been hearing a few stories lately about people screwing with things for the sake of it (or out of rage and frustration) and it is possible the SC is not posting this. If they are shame on that person but if not we should withhold judgement on the dept. 
(25) I call 12.5 a troll! I do not think that an SC member would not know how to spell ""embittered"". BTW, the most douchebaggy of 12.5's statements has been removed (the part about the last candidate.
26) I agree, I smell several trolls on this post. Lets cut the venom and conjecture for a minute and ask the OP what s/he thought about the department when they were there...was it disfunctional? Was there tension among members? How were you treated? What did you think about the possibility of working there? How were the facilities?
(27) # 25 again - looking at the full set of remarks, I'm even more convinced that the poster is a troll.  I've been at many job talks, and while I've seen all sorts of slip ups and technical issues, one thing that I have not seen is presentations that contain ""glaringly incorrect information"".  The candidates are presenting research that they know very well (or have taught multiple times before).  As for incompetence in teaching?  I was rejected off the bat, and I have extensive teaching experience.  Since teaching was central, I can only conclude that the top candidates are more qualified than me.  To believe that TWO of the top choice candidates both presented ""glaringly incorrect information"" AND were incompetent as teacher?  Smells Like Troll Spirit to me.
(28) I interviewed here (different job) and the faculty all seemed very functional.  Most everyone was nice, wanted to talk about my teaching and research experience, asked good smart questions, seemed excited about possible collaboration.  A couple people weren't totally excited about my research, but we found other interesting things to talk about.They gave me my teaching assignment a couple weeks ahead of time and emailed me scans of the relevant chapter in the book.  I have no info on the Vert Ecology search or what went wront, but their other search at least went very smoothly (from my vantage point, anyway).  It would be my inclination to think that it was a problem of fit - the department wanted something that they thought their candidates had but didn't.  I don't think this is particularly unusual - in grad school and postdocing I've seen the backstage of many searches.  People look a lot different on paper (and even on the phone) than they do in person. ","UTSA future hiring Does anyone know if UTSA bio will be hiring again next year? What's the scoop on the ecology expansion? Given the budget cut, is it likely? Does the new hire have any info on this?  I'm sure it's in your best interest to make this expansion happen. Hoping to have a shot at moving close to spouse and kids near by.  Budget cuts = hiring freeze 2) Agree with 1. UT Austin was planning for a fall 2010 search but has halted all plans because of the state wide UT system budget cut implemented this year. It's probably the same for UTSA. 3) Ditto. Same thing happened at my current school. Unfortunate! 4) Not sure about the UT system, but the California system halted searches after their big budget cut. I'm a victim of a failed search that resulted from this cut. Furthermore, there's a lot of speculation that next year's job season will be worse than this year's!!! 
5) I am dreading going through this process all over again next year and, I can't imagine it getting any worse! Budget cuts are abound!
6) I don't know what to believe. My advisor is CERTAIN that next year will be a much better job market (more jobs). I hope he's right. What he bases his opinion on- I have no idea!  All I know is that this year was ROUGH. I don't get how increased budget cuts lead to increase positions...
7) Aside from the UT and UC systems, what other state systems or schools are undergoing budget cuts? just curious...
8) I know the U of Illinois system had some budget cuts but I think they were able to continue hiring TT faculty at least this year.
9) Anyone have any info on how the UT system cut will affect the UTT future searches?

11) No.
12) probably not hiring again next year.

Just FYI. 2)I used 1 yr, and have to call the tech support for sth...after free trial, I never used it again... 3) I have applied for a number of jobs via interfolio. I have never had to pay though.

But I don't have to pay. I'm expecting problems with letters though. 6) You just have to make sure that you request the letters via interfolio. In some ways this is the best feature because you get an automatic email/update when your letter writer submits. You don't have to wonder if s/he has submitted.

On the other hand, I just had a skype interview that was AWESOME because I could see thier facial expressions and nodding/etc.  Would it be bad for me to ask the next place I am phone interviewing at if we can do skype instead? 2) I wouldn't ask. While I totally agree that phone interviews are horrible, it would be unfair for the committee to make a change for you. They would have to make it for everyone. I think SC should do skype interviews but you don't want to come across as telling them how to do their search better. 3) I agree, although I'm still curious to hear others' thoughts.  I was recently given the option between the two, and having never done a skype interview before, I almost opted for the phone option but thought I might be perceived as chicken or oblivious to technology so I went with skype, which turned out to be awesome.  In hindsight, I think they probably didn't actually care, but it worked to my advantage that it was skype.  But if they do care, you don't want to be perceived as knowing better than they how it should be done. 4) I live abroad, which makes it convenient for me to suggest Skype over phone when invited for phone interviews from the US. I haven't had an interview just on the phone, but I like Skype a lot since you can see reactions and who's talking. Would I do that if I was in the US? Maybe. Just say you think it would make the experience more personal and you want the chance to get to know each other a bit? I would think that would go over well. I've been invited to campus after each Skype interview, so I think it can really work well. Just remember to smile, look into the camera, and don't look at notes all the time. 5) Everyone hates phone interviews compared to Skype. 6) @ 5, not true, I prefer phone... 7) Ok ...Most everyone prefers Skype. Why do you prefer phone? 8) With skype, I get distracted by making sure I look confident.  One the phone, I feel more sure that I sound confident, and I can jot down notes and look at my notes without feeling like I need to constantly look directly at the people on skype.",They damn well have a preference if there's a spousal hire that might trip things up.  Or two body problems.  And they might have a pref if they mention 20x that everyone here is married with kids oh oops you don't have kids you might not fit in.  And don't get me started on heteronormative or gender roles bullshit that comes out in these conversations.  #VENTING,"Major HR Flub/ Personal Questions 1) Several schools someone has asked very personal questions, implied that only people with a particular lifestyle would fit in, or point blank asked something illegal.  Does anyone know a way to tell the school that they could handle these factors better without causing a huge investigation from the dean's office?  Who do you report to and how? 2) I would probably send a message from an anonymous email saying I was one of the candidates and this was my experience. I would copy search committee chair, dept chair, dean, and HR. That is, unless I was ok using my name then I would do the same openly. Former seems better IMO cause I don't trust people to not hold things like this against those reporting issues. 3) I don't have the money to do this, but I'd talk to a lawyer with experience with employment law in the state in which the incident occurred. Universities don't do a damn thing until there's legal action. The hint of it might provoke some response. The attorney would at least be able to give you the rundown on your options, and most importantly, should be able to tell you how to do something without exposing yourself to professional retribution.  4) I'm probably going to get flamed for saying this, but let it go. First off, I believe these questions are not themselves illegal (but can be used as evidence of discrimination against protected classes, which is illegal; don't believe me?  read <http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/practices/inquiries_marital_status.cfm> carefully and note that this is from the actual EEOC).  Don't get me wrong, people should not ask these questions, but was it a random clueless grad student or a misguided faculty member who wanted to make small talk, or was it the department chair or the chair of the search committee, who should know better?  In any case, there's nothing to gain here.  Instead, vow that when you're a faculty member you will remind your colleagues not to ask disciminatory questions when searches occur.  5) For me at one it was the person doing the HR discussion whose sole responsibility it is to make sure these kinds of discriminatory things don't enter into hiring and promotion decisions.  At another it was a senior faculty member who knew better in the context of how I would fit in at the school. At a third, it was a department admin.  4) That sucks.  Still, I don't know if you can meaningfully improve their approach without any negative repercussions on yourself, so I'd still say let it go.  6) Well, now, I have joined the club where the associate director directly asked me if I had a husband...  good times... 7) Had a phone interview yesterday, and in the course of talking about myself, mentioned my husband. Wondered later if that was a stupid thing to do or not. 8) @7 don't worry about it, and don't overthink it.  Many people have spouses. ","Is it just me or are evolution searches taking their sweet time this year? 2) they are probably waiting for clearance from the Trump DOJ whether evolution will be legal after January 20. 3) As an evolutionary biologist, I've been applying to a lot of the 'general' or 'organismal' searches, basically all the ones that aren't looking for a molecular, micro, physiologist, something super specific. But I'm more of a SLAC or master's granting uni person","Interview stories Bit of levity - any one have any funny interview stories to share? 1) I don't, but if you look at the wiki a couple of years ago, you can read funny stories (whether they are true or not, I am not sure) about someone trying to sleep with the SC chair or something like that. 2) That might deserve someone going and searching it out to repost as a 'starter' :D 3) I was home for a family event during a phone interview, so I used my Dad's office phone because it's a landline. When the search chair called back the next week, she called that phone number and ended up talking to my Dad, who then texted me to tell me I was invited for an on-campus interview. Looking back, I should have clarified where they should have contacted me after the phone interview...4) Hah, dads. 5) Group interview in the UK. One candidate was an obvious favorite (he was the only one who truly matched the job description and already knew everyone on the search committee, was chumming around with them at dinner, etc.). Each candidate met with the search committee for an hour. ""Inside candidate"" went last while the rest of us hung out in the hall way. There was some commotion & we were told that the last interview had to be interrupted. Eventually it leaks that the chair of the search committee had experienced a seizure during the last presentation. Luckily the insider was a former EMT and tended to the search chair while the ambulence was en route. Surprisingly enough, the inside candidate got the job. 6) On campus interview at small lib arts school in the southern US. HR person is telling me about benefits and what benefits for children/parental leave the college has. Then she leans over the desk and points to my abdomen and says ""and it looks like you'll be needing some of those benefits soon!"" I was NOT pregnant. And, for the record, I'm fairly slim... 7) D:   8) We had a job candidate ask the faculty where they could score the best pot.  No job offer.  9) Sounds like a stiff department 10) Not the biggest deal, but I had a faculty member during the faculty interview portion get visibly upset over something I said (can't even remember what) and storm out of the room. I got the offer, and turned it down, in part because of that moment. 11) That time when all of the faculty wanted to discuss departmental politics OR the moment when I was going to get the big scoop about departmental politics but then my time was up and had to move to the next appointment. 12) Bumped to the top: we need more stories here! 13) here's one: being contacted by department members prior to an interview who tell you that the administration will lie to you. You don't know these people and have never met them either. It's a great way to start an interview. 14) D: to 13 -  I had an interview and went for lunch with the undergraduate students - they were all awesome and gave good info, represented their school well, but I don't think any one told them about illegal questions - I just kind of went with it because I figured it would do me way worse to lecture them on what illegal questions were than to just give a quick answer and redirect. 15) to 14- I had the exact same experience! And like you, I just went with it because I didn't want to embarass them. After the search finished (I didn't get an offer) I told the chair that they should tell students what sort of questions not to ask. The chair thanked me, so hopefully it won't happen to any future candidates at that school. 15) Partway through an interview the search chair and I figured out that he taught I class I took as an undergrad (the chair was a postdoc at that time).  16) In a prof's office where he has photos of his wife, another prominent scientist, all over his office.  At some point he sheepishly admits he knows her work. I mentioned I'd heard they were married.  His jaw drops and he asks how in the world I could have known that.  If I hadn't known, the shrine to his spouse would have looked suspiciously creepy! 17) @16 - maybe he confused ""don't ask job candidates about their partners"" with ""don't mention your own partner""!  18) Job candidate starts talk by acknowledging Search Committee Chair's generous introduction: ""I've only known SCC for 24 hours, but I know how to tell when SCC's lying: *dramatic pause* his lips are moving."" This was the first sign that this would be a memorable interview.  19) Figured out two faculty were married when the second one pulled out baby photos from the same kid I'd seen 30 min before.  They were pretty proud of the kid. 20) Or you are wondering if two faculty are married (or were married) since they look about the same age and have the same last names and collaborate. Then find out independently that they are not married and you breath a sigh of relief that you didnt say anything stupid. 21) That time when I was taken by surprise by how they worded the ""what are your biggest weaknesses?"" question during on on-campus interview, and instead of giving my prepared answer, rambled on for ten minutes in great detail about all my weaknesses. It's starting to be funny in retrospect :)  22)  That time during lunch on the last day of a campus interview  where I was asked by the same person (faculty): a) do you have other campus interviews? b) where? c) are you married? d) what does your husband do for a living?  Ok, that was not funny but, lukily, I had already decided by then that I didn't want the job anyway.","Just got another rejection from a school I had an on-campus interview at....and it was probably my last shot of this year. Funding ends in 10 months and the lab hasn't gotten the grants they applied for this year. So....I guess I'll see some of you next year...either here or when I make your drink at Starbucks. Bitter. 2) Sorry to hear that :-/ x2 3) was just talking to my spouse last night about whether I give it another go next year if none of the jobs I'm interviewing for this year work out... starbucks sounds good compared to that  4) I only had one on-campus interview this year. I just know that I am the second candidate on the list. Not sure how big my chance is. frustrated, too! :(    5) This is the shitty thing.  Coming in 1 behind the hire gets you nothing, even if you are great.  Stochastic chances mean searches fail while good candidates come 1 short at other schools.   4) nah, dozens of searches don’t get the top dawg, then go back to the dawg pile dawg. hang in there. woof.","How to tell your brand new dept you're pregnant? I am 11 weeks pregnant and I knew I was pregnant (6 weeks) during my interview. God it was horrible. I had to run out of a meeting to go barf in the bathroom. Anyway, they offered me the job, we went through negotiations and I accepted. My husband and I tried for a year, I had a miscarriage a year ago, and I had to have surgery to finally get pregnant. Needless to say I wasn't super confident that this one would continue but it appears to be going smoothly. I'm due in the middle of my first semester so I will have to figure out arrangements for my class. I'm wondering what the best way to approach this is? I have another ultrasound at 13 weeks and, assuming all goes well, it'll be time to start announcing. I want to tell him before it circles around to him and he hears from someone else. I'm so nervous! Any advice? Just saw the post below haha. Glad I'm not the only one in this position! 2) Congratulations! You shouldn't worry at all about how to tell this great news! 3) Agree with 2! Congrats! I just got offered a job and the most recent hire before me in the department was a woman in exactly the same situation. She said that the chair was super understanding (as was everyone else) and they even let her start on leave (and thus being paid) when they could have just asked her to defer her start date. Congrats again! You're going to do awesome!:) 1) thanks guys, that makes me feel calmer. The dept head seems like a really family oriented guy (talks about his grandkids etc) so I hope he's excited! 4) Congrats and how exciting. Hopefully you can get teaching deferred for the first semester. As someone who has had miscarriages and ecotopic preg, only to get preg during one of the most inconvenient times, I totally understand. Good luck and I bet they will be understanding. ","Interview invite 2 weeks ago and now.... nothing. No contact to schedule. I'm beginning to wonder if this department has its shit together at all. 2) Same here. Invited two weeks ago, decided on a date, now nothing. The supposed visit is now less than two weeks away but nothing has been booked. 3) They finally contacted me and gave a date. Never asked my availability at all, just handed me a date. When I said it interferred with travel for another interview they said too bad, only time the committee is available. 4) sounds like this department is a bit disfunctional. I would say avoid them but chances are you are desperate for a job and need to take every chance you can get. If you're travel is already booked for the other interview than there is little you can do but tell the university that you absolutely can't make the date they assigned you. 5) FWIW, scheduling a non-negotiable date is standard in many countries.  6) I just made it work. They're a pretty high profile school, so maybe they think they can get away with it...","Spousal hire data Out of some discussions with others, I've been wondering how spousal hires may differ when a woman is the leading spouse versus the man as a leading spouse for male-female couples. My hypothesis would be that a woman offered a job would be less likely to receive a spousal accomodation for a male partner (or receive a ""lesser"" accomodation) given that women are known to fare worse in employment negotiations both inside and outside academia. At the same time, it may be that departments are more willing to accept an ""extra"" hire when they are male. I did some searching onlineand in the literature, but haven't found the answer to this particular question, although I might just need some better search terms. I'll keep looking, but thought someone here may be able to point me in the right direction.  2) This is just a gut feeling based on what I've seen over many years: it is close to neutral, but maybe slightly harder when the trailing spouse is female.  But I've seen all outcomes in all permutations. 3) Jeremy Fox from Dynamic Ecology here. Afraid I don't have much data on this. Spousal hires are a very small fraction of all TT hires in ecology, plus it's not always possible to identify which hires were spousal hires from publicly-available information. So all I can tell you is that the very few spousal hires I know of in my data are split evenly between cases in which women and men are the ""trailing"" partner. 4) OP here, thanks Jeremy. My suspicion was that you wouldn't really have much on this topic, both because of the low numbers and because spouses of ecology folks (both leading and trailing) would often be in other fields/departments. It seems like the type of university-wide datasets that would be needed likely just don't exist and one would instead need to rely on some survey methods to quantify what candidates have been offered when requesting spousal accomodations. 5) Nothing really to add except that I would be really interested in this, too! I also wonder how the competitiveness of different fields combined with the gender balance of those fields (eg engineering faculty searches vs ecology faculty searches) affects any differences that exisit in the liklihood of spousal accomodations. My spouse (male) is in a very specific field that is male-dominated and faculty positions have many fewer applicants whereas in my search in ecology I am competing with sometimes hundreds of qualified cadidates. He is two years behind me in the process, but we both sort of expect that he will land a job first based on the experiences of others in his program. 6) Spousal hire hire. I don't know how representative this is but my department has 4 spousal hires all female and all younger than the males that got jobs first.","Applying for academic positions is a lot of work. I only apply to positions I care about. I spend more time than I should admit on crafting my documents. The least a search committee could do is to SEND ME A FUCKING REJECTION LETTER AND NOT KEEP ME HANGING. I'm grateful for this board, at least I can figure it out, but I can't help but feel shitty that they don't send rejection letters. x6 2) Same thing here. And I now feel grateful for the places who send one  3) I know this is not usually recommended, but I reached out to the search committee chair for 3-4 positions about 2 months after the deadline. A couple of them responded politely stating they are in the midst of conducting phone interviews. The rest said they are still reviewing apps. I am aware of the arguments often made against reaching out to the chair, but it was helpful for me to get that closure. 4) We're not supposed to tell you you're rejected until the very end of the process, i.e. negotiations are complete and the chosen candidate has signed and returned their letter. It's HR's rules (HR is paranoid about being sued by an aggrieved applicant).  I am sure anonymously posting on here is against the rules as well. 5) I understand that #4. But, I wonder if there can be a middle ground, i.e., SCs can at least inform the applicants about the status of the search with a caveat that more applications might be reviewed if the need arises.  I am sympathetic to the need for the HR rules. But, the absolute lack of transparency is unfair to applicants. x3  6) If you are waiting after in-person interviews, reach out so they know you might still be interested if #1 rejects.  Before the interview list has been picked you're probably going to annoy the search chair. 7) I got a rejection email last month... for a job I applied to in Dec 2018. 8) The harsh reality is that if you don't hear anything about an interview/offer, usually within 2-3 months, you didn't get the job.  I recognized this to be true after waiting to hear about jobs for which I phone interviewed and even inteviewed in person where I never heard from the SC chair, department, or university (still wiaing 8+ years later, Uni of X!).  By the time a search officially closes (which, as 7 indicated, may be MANY months down the road), it is usually very obvious that you are not going to get the offer.  This is not to excuse the lack of communication, but I found it better for my mental heatlh to assume every application was a rejection from the moment I submitted until the moment I got an offer (which did ultimately happen). 9) B/c of complaints on here about not being notified, I asked HR if I could contact all phone interviewees to update them about their position in the search, even the ones that didn't make a campus interview. My HR asked to see the rough draft email and then granted me permission, but only after campus interviews were confirmed. The next time I chair a search, I will also ask permission to contact the rest of the pool. I would suggest that all SCs do this in the future. The whole process took about 5 minutes of my time. 10) (8 again) - cheers to (9) - agree that it would be great if all chairs did this. x2 11) great job #9! x3 12) As soon as I send my materials, I try to assume I'm not good enough and didn't get the job anyway.  My self esteem is already low enough (related to the job search only! hah hah) that it doesn't really make a difference there, and I already know it is unlikely I'll ever hear from the committee. 12 again... Sorry for overly dramatic self pity there... Rough week (not just application related, hah hah) 13) I've gotten emails from colleagues about not getting on-campus interviews and not getting jobs. They send normal polite emails, ""hey I just heard you're not getting an offer"" or ""hey I hear you're not in the shortlist"". These people are on the very top of my list of nice human beings. It feels horrible when you know colleagues are in search committees and don't reach out. WTF. I understand how the system works, just F*&^% let me know where I stand. It's not too much to ask. ","Job talks as webinars in the age of COVID-19 Hi all, I just had an upcoming campus visit and job talk moved to an online remote interview because of social distancing and COVID-19. Does anyone who's perhaps recently been a similar situation (1) have any advice for maximizing interactions during a day-long Zoom interview and (2) have specific tips for converting a job talk into an engaging webinar? X3 2) I just had to do one of these... it's a real bummer. The small informal conversations and fluidity of discussion are lost. As for the job talk, I included lots of animations, and insterted slides between my different sections with questions for the audience to think about to break things up and show how I would have engaged the audience if everyone was there... I also put a little extra enthusiasm in my voice to compensate for not being able to be there in person...it seemed to go over well. Another piece of advice: have more questions ready than you would have otherwise. I think virtual discussions just naturally peter off more quickly because it's hard not to accidentally interrupt someone else so people are quieter than normal; be ready to keep the conversation moving. I would also ask if they are open to (short) follow-up discussions on email - as I said, everything seems truncated in a virtual interview relative to in-person. (3) I just got done with an all day Zoom campus interview - it was absolutely exhausting. It was 10 hours long sitting in one chair in front of a computer. My face hurt from being ""on"" for so long. I agree with 2, that I had to have a lot of questions ready. Also I liked what 2 said about breaking up slides with possible think questions - I did this once and asked students during my teaching demo to use the chat box or turn off there microphone to answer questions. It's completely different than in person - but i'm glad the committee decided to do this rather than totally cancel. 4) Here's a site with tips about using cue cards for remote interviews: https://www.higheredjobs.com/Articles/articleDisplay.cfm?ID=2185&Title=How%20to%20Use%20Cue%20Cards%20for%20Your%20Remote%20Interview 4) I just finished up a multi-day remote interview. I think it went pretty well but I agree with what others have said. It was a long haul and a lot of opportunities for informal/fluid conversation were lessened. It was helpful to have a LOT of questions for each meeting prepared ahead of time to make sure that conversation value was maximized. All in all the webinar was a very similar format as it would have been on campus but we had breaks throughout with opportunities for audience members to ask questions. Obviously would have been great to visit the department in person, but it was still a good experience and I enjohyed my ""visit"" "
University of Central Florida The rejection email didn't even bother to say what university it was from. I had to look at the email address to figure out who was rejecting me. WTF? (1) It was totally a general rejection - all schools rejected us at once!  Saves time I guess.,"Job description Does anyone know if the % breakdown of job is ever negotiable?  I am neg in a department where 45(r)/45(t) is common but this job is 45(r)/50(t).  I am not really concerned about the actual percentage so much as perception (and this is a research uni, so I doubt teaching will be weighted > heavily than research for tenure review).  I would like to neg for 45/45 to be consistent with other appointments in the department, but don't want to ask for something inappropriate.   I don't think you should quibble about a mere 5% difference, can it really be that quantifiable? It's really about a 50/50 composition since service is usually a did some/did none evaluation. 2) It might be that the university or department has changed its standards for tenure recently and that what is in your contract reflects a new/newish change. And this small change is probably more symbolic (school may want to appear less biased towards research maybe?) than something that actually merits a ""negotiation"". Although I guess you could just ask about it in a very off handed way to see what it is based on. Maybe couch it as something you noticed compared to other faculty members you had spoken with and you were curious why there was a difference. 3) I'd actually be careful about a 50/45 split weighted toward teaching. I know it seems small, but at my university (which is a research uni) you need to demonstrate ""excellence"" in your primary role - which is whatever you have the highest percentage in. Tenure requirements to demonstrate excellence in teaching are much more onerous than just demonstrating effectiveness in teaching. I would at least inquire about what this might mean for your tenure process.",NA,NA,NA,"Do you guys list manuscripts that you have submitted for review on your CV? (Manuscripts that have been submitted to a journal, but are still under review and haven't been accepted)  If so, how do you list them?  Thanks! 1) Yes I list them. I have a separate section after Published papers (this section also includes in revision papers). I think these are quite relevant and should really be included. 2) I list them and I list a few of the next papers that I will submit in a 'Publications in Preparation' section. I don't go to crazy with this and only include a few that really are going to become submitted manuscripts shortly. I've seen some cv's that have more 'in prep' papers than actually published ones and that definitely does not look. 3). Definitely put MS that are submitted in there. Along with journal submitted to (helps that they are glammy types). Ideally, I wouldn't want to put in prep stuff there, but I need to pad (and general feeling is that yes, it looks like padding. Never more than 1 or 2. 3) I have a section for in prep where I have a handful of manuscripts that are soon to be submitted.  Its all a proportional thing.  If you only have 5-6 manuscripts in your entire portfolio, then indicating you have 1-2 in prep is ok, if you have a dozen, the committee might laugh.  However, if you publish 5-10 manuscripts a year, or more, it might be reasonable to have 5-10 in review (or more) and another 5-10 in prep.  So, there really is not a set rule.  A lot of people say to leave in prep off entirely when applying.  However, I disagree, especially if you only just recently graduated.  Any new graduate should have a few publications, 1-2 in review, and 1-2 in prep.  Others may disagree with me, but I would rather see you have papers in various stages and that you are not coming to my school having nothing in the pipeline. ","""For this application, please write a completely new teaching and research statement with extensive extra sections not required for other jobs you applied for and in a completely different, rearranged format. We want to really screw your time for a very low probability of payoff."" 2) This is why I'm amazed by the people who submit 100+ applications a year while hopefully continuing their research so they'll be well qualified next year too. It takes a lot of time to rework each application, and then x100, how do you do it? Then again, if they are going to make 99% of the decision based on your CV, maybe I'm the fool for trying so hard on the other parts. 3) I have heard from search chairs that this is done at SLACs especially to reduce the number of applicants. It works. I have definitely had to pour many hours into writing ""integrated"" statements. Got the campus interviews, but holy christ was that a lot more work than any of the other applications. I also feel the same way about the ""diversity"" statement, which can be a real bitch to write. I get its value, but like #2 said, it's such a fucking waste of time if you end up not being considered because of your CV or cover letter. 4) As a practical matter, one should have diversity statements that they easily modify as these are so common now. I always wonder how important these are. I am guessing that diversity statemets wouldn't get you hired but if you said something stupid it could be a way to cut?  5) Diversity statements are important at SLACs, in my experience, because they show that you understand something about the climate on campus. It is also a chance for you to demonstrate your understanding of the liberal arts environment. Lastly, if the college serves underrepresented groups, the diversity statement is the place to reveal that you understand what that means and how important that is to you as an educator and, in my opinion, a mentor. 6) there is only one thing you have to understand, treat everyone the same. 7) I interviewed at a SLAC that required a diversity statement. Diversity stuff never came up in either the phone or the on-campus interview. It's something I'm genuinely interested in increasing in the sciences and I've been involved in diversity programs before. So on the way to the airport, I finally asked the search chair about diversity initiatives and its importance on campus. He told me it was basically not actually important at all in the hiring decision or anything going on much on campus (very, very white, like 97% in a very white, small community). He said it was something HR made them put in there, but no one actually cared or read those things. So there you go. Be even more pissed about it. This was at a SLAC by the way, so they aren't actually always important there. 8) Someone deleted my comment. I asked #7 if they interviewed at highly ranked SLAC because my interviews at such schools did bring up the diversity/inclusive environment statements. 9) I am not #7 but I have interviewed at least one ""highly-ranked"" SLAC. I did meet with a campus office interested in increasing diversity but they told me they had no say in the decision (just that the office had no decision...they didn't say diveresity statements weren't important to the search). They also wanted to be clear that they are there for faculty as well. The search committee never really brought it up. It is a good thing to write however as it can help you think about how to increase participation of under represented groups as well as making sure your teaching/mentoring style is sensitive to these issues. However, for a ""typical"" faculty position, even when they state they want diversity statements, the quality of such a statement is far down the list of things that make the search committee excited about hiring you. I work with and teach students from varied backgrounds, volunteer with the SEEDS program etc. and happily engage in discussions about these matters. It just never seemed a deciding factor to me while at job interviews. Just my anectode. 10) I can deal with every school requesting different materials, but would appreciate if the information in the job ad matched up in any way to what is requested by the online application form.  Job ad - ""have 5 letters prepared"", Website - ""list your 3 references here"", Job ad - ""write a cover letter that includes research interests, future directions, teaching experience and philosophy"", Website - ""upload your 1-pg cover letter here, your research statement here, and your teaching statement here, and also we'll need that diversity statement we didn't mention in the job ad."" My request, one person on the search committee please try to apply for the job and check for inconsistencies and fix it.  11) I have interviewed at top 5 SLACs over the past few years and no one ever brought up any diversity stuff.  In fact, beyond the check form, I've never been asked anything about it ever.  ","Equal Opportunity Forms 1) There used to be a discussion about this but I can't find it. Anyways, has anyone heard of an outside candidate beating an inside hire? 2) It's ridiculous how much this topic comes up. It's almost like a joke. Here's my experiences (again). In two searches at my current tenure track position, where inside candidates were in the pool, both times they were not hired. As a PhD student I saw two additional searches where inside candidates were not hired. As a masters student I saw one search where an inside candidate was not hired. My best friend in grad school beat out an inside candidate for his first tenure track job. These universities encompass SLACS, M/Ls, and R1s. So, in my experiences (and everyone is going to have different experiences), I have never seen an inside candidate get hired! Now, a good friend of mine who used to teach at a SLAC told me that his university only hired VAPs as kind of a ""pre-tenure track"" position. If they  liked you, a crap search would be created and you would be hired on as tenure track by the next year or two. If they didn't, they would cut your position and hire a new VAP. So, in that scenario, it would appear that inside candidates are the only candidates hired. 3) Inside cnadidates get beaten out all the time.  Your strategy should be the same no matter what: Be the best candidate, regardless of whether there's a VAP in the mix or not.  You're almost certinaly competing with people who are friends/colleagues with people in the department where you're applying, but no one worries about this since it's clearly out of your control.  Just like VAPs are out of your control.  Trust me, all departments want to hire the best person for the job.  Sometimes it's an inside candidate, sometimes it's an external candidate.  Be the best candidate.  99 times of out of 100, if a VAP beats you it was because they were a better candidate, end of story. 4) Some searches for VAPs are created with a search for a tt position built in to the VAP term. When that happens, I think it's pretty clear you're going to have a favorable situation. Like much about the search process, though, it's hard to know from afar. I've never heard of an R1 using a VAP as a way to feel out a candidate for a tt position, but I think it's much more common for SLACs to do that. 5) If you are on the inside and you fit in you have an advantage.  If you don't fit in you are at a disadvantage.  Community colleges very frequently hire from their adjunct and temporary folks.  SLACs vary.  If an SLAC or regional state U is a sweat shop 18-20hr/sem school, and you are a VAP, you have a huge advantage if you just smooze.  These folks dont care how good you are, just go to the weekly lunch and be buddy buddy with everyone.  At research schools, its the opposite.  Here, VAPs have a huge disadvantage because they will be teaching more than a typical faculty member and will not have much opportunity to perform at the level the faculty at that school do. 6) When a SLAC wants a 3-year VAP, doesn't that suggest they're thinking about hiring someone? A 1-year VAP indicates to me someone went on sabbatical or bought out for a bit, and there's probably not a chance to stay on. 7) I know of multiple year VAPs at SLACs that exist due to a hole in the course offerings for reasons that may or may not be temporary (length of ""problem"" creating the hole was for an unknown amount of time [ended up being 2 years], 3 years [will end up being more], and [potentially] 10 years in the specific situations), and the administration will not open a tenure track line anytime soon. 8) One SLAC that I'm familiar with has 3 year rotating dean positions and they often hire 3 year VAPS with the expectation that the dean will return to teaching after their 3 year term. Not sure how common that is. 9) I have experienced that also, #8. Further, the VAP slots are 3 years MAX, so if the dean stays on for longer than 3 years, they hire a new VAP to maintain the position. 10) If it's a true search, then for sure outside candidates frequently beat inside candidates; the problem are the searches that aren't ""real"" where there is a job posting for a spousal hire or a pre-selected candidate where they aren't really going to consider anyone else - these fake searches are done because departments often aren't allowed to hire without a search - without inside info, I would never assume that a search isn't real",The emphasis on kids is surprising given that most biologists acknowledge that overpopulation is problematic. ,"What to wear on interviews? 1) Any good sources of attire advice for on-campus interviews? Would this differ by school -- i.e., diverse Biology department at a private university vs. Ecology department at a state school? 2) I do slacks or dress pants and a button-up. Jeans are generally discouraged, esp on the biomedical end of the spectrum. 3) Suit up. 4) What region? I think it matters a bit more if you're somewhere more pretentious (south, eastern seaboard). I've only been involved in searches where the faculty don't care, which might or might not be the case for you. 5) You really can't go wrong with a cape. x5  6) Star Trek Uniform  7) How about for a Skype interview? Seems like a shirt & tie should be appropriate. Right? 8) Honestly, I don't want any job where what I wear is a deciding factor. 9) I bet there are some jobs you want where the dean or academic VP is going to consciously or unconsciously evaluate whether you dressed the part, even if none of your future colleagues will. x2 10) #8 here, and I'm being a bit facetious. But once we are within the range of looking presentable I think worrying about this is superfluous. Understand why some might be concerned though. 11) Fair point. 12) I'm on an interview now, and was told by my home institution to dress down a little bit on the second day. My department head told me that he didn't trust candidates over-dressed. Here, I asked the admin if that was a good idea during an escort between meetings, and learned that doing that is VERY, VERY discouraged. I'm interviewing at a department dominated by ecologists (and they dress very casually), not fancy genomics biologist. And still it was semi-formal wear both days (sports coat, dress slacks and tie both days).  So, definitely dress very serious on day one, and have some options for day two, and find a confidential informant to tell you that school's culture, because I'm learning that it varies by place, and you can't judge how to dress by how the faculty dress when you are there. 13) #10 is correct.  As long as you're somewhere between a Slayer Reign in Blood tshirt and a tuxedo it really doesn't matter. 14) Can confirm that my Slayer shirt was not helpful when I interviewed at Red Lobster. 15) I think #12's advice is good - Dress formal for Day 1 when you'll be giving your big seminar, and pack 2 options for Day 2 so you can decide between being formal again, or dressing down a bit (although I think it's better to err on the side of looking professional rather than too casual). Also, I think that because of concious/unconcious bias, clothing choice matters a lot more for women. Studies suggest that women who dress more formally are often more likely to be seen as competent and serious candidates. 16) Good advice that I received suggested that both men and women suit up on day one, especially if that is the day that you are giving your research talk. Day 2 you can dress down a little, but you should still be dressed better than everyone else in the department. Best advice I can give is to make sure that your clothes fit and you are comfortable in them. Interviewing is uncomfortable enough, you don't want to be stuck in itchy, tight clothes all day long, or worse something that is hot and shows all your sweat. I never thought this would be such a big deal, but after sitting in on a number of hiring committees drunig grad school, even our laid back department judged heavily on dress. I once sat in on a conversation where the faculty complained for 30 minutes because one of the male candidates didn't wear a tie, this coming from a department where NO ONE wears a tie ever.","I'm wondering if there's any point in checking the wiki for the next week, what with break. Also, I wonder if SCs are aware of this place and what their thoughts are?2) search committees know about this place. depending on SC member some will read over what is being said. 3) some SC are getting phone requests out before the break, so might be worth checking","University of Pittsburgh-Bradford Thought I saw the job posted here, but apparently that was a different St. Edward's position! Posting here for updates 2) Any updates? They were supposedly meeting last week to make the short list...3) Still haven't heard anything... anyone have an update? 4) Nope : ( 5) Sent them a major update to my CV (a substantial grant) about a week or so ago (around 01/21) and they congratulated and thanked me for the update, but said nothing about the progress of the search. 6) Word has it they are still narrowing down - I think since it's a smaller school they've skipped phone interviews and are just going to campus visits. 7) Well, then here's a question along those lines, has anyone had their references contacted for letters? They just wanted contact information with the application materials. 8) Haven't heard from my writers, and they typically let me know. But the order of operations is sometimes weird - I've had references contacted after an interview (x2) 9) I'm actually really curious to know how many people applied for this position - I'm the first poster. I wonder since it wasn't originally on the wiki we're seeing a smaller than usual slice of applicants? 10) Does any one want to contact them? 11) LOL! Go for it. I prefer not to pester folks, as it gets you in their heads for the wrong reason 12).....#11 here again, I have another grant update to send them, so let me ask and take the bullet. Will report back if I hear anything. May the Force Be With Us 13) You who are about to email the chair, we salute you. But seriously, daaaaang congrats with the grants. What kind of invert stuff you do? Also, it's gonna seriously suck if there were phone interviews but none of those folks made it to the wiki 14) Conservation genetics 15) Neat - the question came out of 'maybe these are grants I should add to my things to apply to list for next year', but our fields are different (taxonomy/syst). No word back? 16) Nope, radio silence this time. Will let you know if I hear. I updated them with my new grant and asked where they were with the search, but have not heard anything yet. 17) Thanks for the update! 18) I got a phone interview when they advertised this position two years ago, but never heard from the committee again since. Learned later through this wiki that the search was canceled due to budget issues. So, a) they do have phone interviews at St. Ed's, b) let's hope it's not another canceled search this time around. 19) OK, the dept chair got back to me and said they are moving a little slow and that they are still narrowing down the candidate pool. He said it may be a few more weeks. 20) Thanks conservation genetic person! My hope is that they would've told you if there had been phone interviews, so maybe we're all still in the running? Also concerned becasue it's starting to run a little late in the season... 21) Well, there's always the possbility that he lied to me, but I believed what he said. 22) This thread motivated me to send in an update as well (published a paper) and he said that they would be narrowing down to ""considering just a few candidates within the next few weeks."" Not sure what that means in regards to my app, but it sounds like people are still in the running. 23) 'Few weeks'! I feel like they're risking loosing applicants to other searches with that time frame, but who knows : / 24) Alright, here we go again, any news? 25) Nope, and I'm not e-mailing them anymore, as I'm afraid it'll label me as immature and pesty. 26) 24 here again - fair enough! I think we've all emailed them once, lol (27) where there's smoke? 28) Are we the fire? Are they the fire? How do I metaphor? 28) Maybe he/she is saying there are problems with this school due to it having issues moving forward with the search??? 29) What is this thread even about - St. Ed's, U Pitt-Bradford, ??","Are people upset that departments would hire candidates specifically to add gender or racial diversity? 2) When that means not hiring the best candidate, yes. And these days, this is pretty common. There's nothing wrong with designing a search to address specific barriers that affect various groups. For instance, making an extra effort to get a broad applicant pool is great. Providing resources for expecting or nursing mothers who are candidates is also great. Cracking down on sexual harrassment and assault is great. But more and more these days, it seems like universities want the quick fix. So they do ""equity"" hiring based only on gender or race (usually gender) without any consideration for how barriers differ within various groups. Often they end up hiring white women from privileged backgrounds who have no kids and are either single or have a trailing spouse. If universities want to get equity right and truly maintain excellence as the central mission, they should copy the fields with the highest stakes, like the military. In the military, they devote resources to helping support people from disadvantaged backgrounds, but they don't lower the bar (or else people would die). I worry that the more our field goes over the identity politics cliff, the more it declares to the world that the work we do no longer matters. (x3) 3) It's also not fair to people from UR groups who are hired when they are the best candidates. In my dept, we just hired a woman who was clearly the top candidate, but in previous years we've done diversity hiring. Unfortunately, this latest hire will probably feel some of this stigma unfairly.    4) Think how incredibly demeaning it would be to say to someone, ""You were a diversity hire"" or ""The only reason we hired is that you are a white male"".  The reason those are demeaning is that deep down inside we all know that the job is supposed to go to the best candidate, irrespective of factors they can't control like their race, gender, orientation, etc. (x2) 5) doesn't this message board sort of illustrate that you can define 'best' in many different ways? If a Dean literally says ""you can only hire X demographic regardless of qualifications"" then sure, that's unfair. But this conversation is often had by people frustrated they don't have a job yet, and so they undermine or belittle the resultant hire because they can't objectively see their own weaknesses or the hire's strengths. Maybe the faculty need someone who can promote online education, or get military funding--there are often lots of other criteria and the peanut gallery does not always know them  6) #5, are you saying that ""diversity"" is not a factor in recruitment?  Also, yes, a department may decide that a candidate who adds diversity to their department is the ""best"" candidate simply because he/she adds diversity and that's what they value.  That's their call.  But suppose another department does not value diversity.  In fact, they think it would lead to strife and they want to avoid it.  Are they allowed to specifically *ignore* ""diverse"" candidates?  If not, why not?  Hiring/excluding any candidate on the basis of race, gender, etc. is a form of discrimination, so why would it be acceptable in the first case, but not in the second?  Or we could be ethically consistent and say that all discrimination is bad, period, and hiring should be completely blind to race, gender, etc. 7) glad to see people having this conversation - hiring on the basis of diversity is a load of crap. It only gives the racists more fuel and hurts diversity hires in the end (and everyone who isn't white). 8) Keep in mind that administrations (and administrators) have their own priorities that may or may not be aligned with departmental requests and recommendations.A department may ask to hire one peson only to have an administrator make the offer to someone else. 8) #5 here again, I agree diversity is a consideration in some searches. @6, I appreciate your point, but what I think makes those examples different is that if you take a bio dept. that has 30% female asst. profs, and look at the gender ratio of applicants to that dept (assume for argument's sake it's 50:50), then you are left with two possible explanations: 1-- women candidates are not as talented or accomplished as male counterparts, or 2-- there is some sex-based bias in either opportunities available to women to be on an equal footing, or implicit bias in judging their accomplishments more harshly. For example, there's evidence that letter writers write differently for men vs. women. If a department wants to consider those things when reviewing candidates, I don't think that is inherently bad. I think ignoring diversity issues leaves us exactly where we are with accepting institutional biases. 9) @5, the data compiled by Dynamic Ecology suggest that new faculty hires have recently been ~60% women in EEB, so for every department you describe with 30% women assistant profs, there are more depts with the opposite numbers. NRC also did a study comparing recent hires to the applicant pool across STEM fields and found women have about a 2:1 advantage, which matches the findings of the experimental study by Williams and Ceci in PNAS. So, in current hiring, there is strong evidence that whatever bias there is against female applicants is currently being more than compensated for (probably by AA). Also, interestingly, there is very little evidence that implicit bias, as measured by the IAT (which measures mental associations), translates into actual biased actions. So, the argument that AA (as it's currently practiced) merely compensates for institutional biases doesn't hold water. And that's not even considering the fact that AA tends to be applied based on group identity rather than barriers, so, e.g., rich white women with no kids and supportive advisors get more AA than poor, first-generation straight white men (whereas the latter probably faces more institutional barriers). 9 again) One thing I'll add re: 5's hypothetical is that you'd need an absolutely gigantic dept to be able to infer anything about bias from comparing numbers of assistant profs to applicant pools. e.g., a typical dept at a large R1 might have 5-6 APs max, so 5's example would be akin to having 2/6 women vs. 3/6 being deemed evidence of bias, i.e. a difference of one hire. No one would ever apply statistical thinking that sloppy to their research, but people seem to do it regularly when it comes to politically charged topics (where they are invested in getting a particular answer). Not a knock against 5 specifically--it's human nature and we all do it--but it's something to guard against. 10) The dynamic ecology methods apply statistical thinking to severely incomplete data. Talk about sloppy, I dont understand why people continue to reference it. 11) @10 do you think Dynamic Ecology is wrong about the 60% women thing? As far as I know, they went and figured out who all the hires were at every job for two years. So their sample (from which 60% is derived) is almost the same size as the population--seems pretty robust to me (even if some people don't like their answer). Kate Clancy's survey studies of self-selected participants are way, way sketchier statistically and people cite those constantly (because they arrive at politically correct answers). And even if D.E. is wrong about 60%, there's still NRC, Williams and Ceci, and, I suspect, the anecdotal experience of everyone who's been at a North American R1 the last 5 years and has seen this stuff again and again. 12) Williams and Ceci is absolute bollocks, as has been pointed out here before. Biology not math-heavy? Ha! http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2015/04/no_sexist_hiring_in_stem_fields_a_vaunted_new_study_makes_that_claim_unconvincingly.html  13) I am all for diversity in STEM and would like to see gender balance and minorities represented in our field. What pisses me off is self-righteous MEN (who are already in tenured faculty jobs), chest thumping and proclaiming on Twitter that departments should ONLY hire women nowadays to solve the problem of gender inbalance that THEY created because they screwed up. 14) @12 here is a good response to the criticisms of Williams and Ceci by a Northwestern researcher whose specialty is STEM gender bias (and which also references the NRC study) http://d-miller.github.io/PNAS-Debate/. Again, it's the multiple independent lines of evidence (NRC, Dynamic Ecology, Williams and Ceci, etc.) that make the case for a net-female advantage in STEM faculty hiring convincing to me. There's also a simple explanation--affirmative action--which is obviously salient enough in people's departments that threads like this get lots of input and attention. You can point out flaws in each study (as with any study finding pro-male bias), but is anyone actually arguing that the main conclusion--women currently have a statistical advantage over men in STEM faculty hiring--is wrong? And if so, what's the countervailing evidence? 15) It is a good question. For me, it is just another example of the generation before me fucking things up and forcing me to suffer from the consequences. 16) It's partly that, but let's not miss just how far off the rails some of this campus DEI stuff has gone: https://www.jamesgmartin.center/2018/01/university-michigans-costly-pointless-diversity-plan/ . 17) Here's some thoughts I've had: The pools for TT jobs continue to get more and more competitive because the # of PhDs is increasing at an unsustainable rate. When this is combined with real gender inequality issues, it means that slight advantages or disadvanatges are given. One way to ""turn down the temperature"" on this debate, which is desparately needed IMO is to create less intensely competitive pools. The logic behind the wide net ""ecolgist"" pool is not strong anymore to me - it's kind of selfish. SCs need to know what they're looking for and advertise more specifically. We're also pushing out too many PhDs, and the system has rewarded those that do. 18) I agree that turning down the temperature on this issue is needed, but I must say I've been pleasantly surprised with how (mostly) thoughtfully it's being discussed in this forum (for comparison, check out poliscirumors or econjobrumors, if you dare). So good on you, ecologists! Also, I strongly agree with the suggestion to reduce the number of PhDs. But I don't think making ads narrower will solve the aggregate problem (the total number of prospectives and jobs would still be the same). I unfortunately also don't think that reducing the number of PhDs (which is necessary in its own right) will obsolete these AA/equity debates much, because there would still be a strong filter, just applied at different stages. For better or worse, unis just need to think hard about how to best pursue equity without compromising excellence or fairness. My guess is that focusing on specific barriers rather than numbers and quotas is the way to get this right. For the sake of research funding and keeping tuition in check, I also think they should dismantle a lot of this extra diversity bureaucracy. It doesn't seem to accomplish much besides lead indirectly to higher tuition (which, ironically, is bad for equity and diversity if you care about economically disadvantaged folks). 19) Another way to help turn the temperature down is to excplicitly frown upon/reprimand profs who launch social media shaming campaigns against other scientists for (respectfully stated and honestly/rigorously arrived at) opinions, or worse, research, that they don't like. This happens often in the humanities, and has recently happened a couple of times in EEB. Science communication is important, but I think if we are honest with ourselves, we know deep down that researchers (especially profs) who rile people up on Twitter all day (usually at the expense of research and teaching/advising) are not really contributing to the field. 20) Faculty at most large institutions are teaching/mentoring a diverse student body. Shouldn't the faculty mirror the student body in terms of their own aggregate diversity (both gender balance-wise and race-wise)? What sort of message does it send if this is not the case? 21) When demographics and immigration create generational imbalances, it can make sense that the 40-60 year old pool doesn't match the 18-22 year old pool. 22) I also don't think people who make arguments like the one 20 made realize how insidious it becomes if you apply it to analogous situations. For instance, should there be a 50% quota for male K-12 teachers? Should we discriminate against Jews (which we used to) and Asians (which we still do) in elite university admissions? Because what kind of a message would it send if they were overrepresented and other groups were underrepresented? Should we discriminate against women in undergrad admissions now, since they are overrepresented? Should we have a 50% quota for women in prisons? What message does it send young boys that most prisoners are male? ..and so on. Or, maybe, why don't we just raise our children to have a common identity as Americans/Canadians (or wherever they live) and not obsess about the demographics of every department in every walk of life? This of course is not to say that we shouldn't address barriers that we find facing UR groups. We definitely should. But equality of outcome is a fool's errand at best, and dangerous at worst (see: the history of every communist country that has ever existed). 23) #20 here. The general implication of the responses to my comments seems to be that those who have tt faculty positions are, in fact, the most deserving, in some objective sense. What about the possibility of implicit (and explicit) bias skewing the existing faculty's racial and gender makeup? Are you guys really arguing that white males make up the majority of faculty positions because they are simply better? That seems like an indefensible position, given the Byzantine vagaries of the academic hiring process (on what objective basis are you calculating them to be ""better"" than their competitors were?). Now the comment about older faculty being more demographically out of balance with their student population for reasons of demographic lag: that is a good hypothesis. But that would imply that new hires are at least 50:50 male and female, with a sizeable number of African Americans and Latinos, among other groups. I doubt such a demographic shift in hiring has happened to keep pace with the shifting demographics of college campuses (and, by the way, women now make up a majority of college undergraduate students). 24) I think we have made or surpassed the 50:50 gender mark for new hires, but this seems to have been achieved by hiring the sisters of the old boys club rather than a broader swath of underrepresented groups. My general impression is that SCs fall over themselves to offer jobs to white women with expensive college pedigrees, but there doesn't seem to be anywhere near the level of motivation to after an ""unclubbable"" person of color. 25) Anecdote and conjecture don’t add much to the argument tbh . 26) @20, this notion that science is so subjective that people can't objectively recognize excellence reminds me of the comment @2 made, in that if it's really true that it's impossible to tell good science from bad science, then the work we do must not matter. There is of course no single perfect metric of scientific excellence, but there are many that are strongly correlated (pubs, pub quality, citations, ability to give good talks, etc.) and together provide multiple lines of evidence for excellence. SCs try to evaluate excellence based on these multiple lines (that is, when deans aren't telling them who to hire for other reasons; see thread in the box below). Also, @20 seems to be implying that in a perfect meritocracy, the demographics of science would perfectly resemble the demographics of society. I'm not so sure. If that were true, then if you looked at the fields in which it was easiest to objectively measure merit, you would expect to see the most balanced demographics. But in fact you see the opposite. For instance, it's hard to imagine a field where it's easier to measure merit than 100m sprinting--you literally measure it. Of the 500 all-time fastest 100m sprints, over 99% have been made by men of recent (i.e. last 300yrs) West African ancestry. In fact, just about all sports have severely skewed demographics in some way. In academia, the fact that about half of all Nobel prizes in STEM subjects (excluding Peace, Literature, etc.) have gone to Jews is also unlikely explained by privilege, since they have been one of the most persecuted groups in the 20th century. Also, the fact that meritocracies in ultra competitive fields shoiuld be demographically skewed is mathematically inevitable: even the slightest difference in mean or variance between two groups will result in a massive skew in the demographics at the right tail. Now, none of this implies that the skew should favor white men per se; it may be that once we remove barriers, science would consist of almost entirely WOCs. But again, this is why we should focus on barriers rather than numbers, and definitely rather than abandoning faith in scientific merit as a concept (the latter is an invitation for governments to cut our funding, which is happening). 27) wow there is a lot of decidedly NON-objective language and anecdotal examples of ""data"" to sort through here. I guess that answers the OP's (_leading_) question as to whether people are upset. It's hard not to be upset when you feel left out, especially if you're not used to that feeling. Unfortunately many people grow up feeling like they're destined to be left out, or they just think won't be able to succeed so they shouldn't bother trying - those people need role models and opportunities... role models and opportunities that other people take for granted.  28) ""There was another candidate who does better research than you and who gave a better talk than you. But we hired *you* because children are only allowed to look up to people with similar genitals and/or melanin levels as themselves, and that was more important to us than the quality of your work.""  #27, would you ever say that to someone's face?  If not, then why would you advocate for policies in favour of that statement?  It's amazing to me that I have to say this: **Race and gender are MEANINGLESS with respect to the quality of one's work.  Everyone should be on a level playing field when it comes to hiring. All discrimination based on race, gender, etc. should be completely illegal.**  29) Author of ""data"" comments here (9, 22, 26, etc.): @27, my fact claims have been that women currently have a statistical advantage in STEM faculty hiring; that a competitive true meritocracy in any field would not produce the same demographics as the general population; and that institutional barriers facing individuals can't be boiled down to just their gender and race (e.g., economic barriers can face men or women, white or non-white). Do you have any evidence or reasoned arguments to suggest that any of these are wrong? Do I have an opinion? Sure, of course I do. My opinion is that focusing equity work on dismantling specific barriers (expanding parental leave, paid opportunities for undergraduates, etc.) but not lowering the standards in hiring is the best way to pursue excellence and fairness. If you disagree, I welcome reasoned arguments against my position. If you think I'm biased, I welcome you pointing out what evidence I've overlooked. But the kind of trope you're offering about how white men are a monolith that take everything for granted is not intellectually becoming. 28) I'd like some of what you're smoking if you seriously think people who are equally good at their jobs all end up with the same CVs given the existence of BSD PIs who preferentially pick on members of underrepresented groups and their slightly less extreme friends. 29) As a WOC, I can tell you that representation really does matter. I've NEVER had an instructor who looked like me. EVER. Should race/gender be taken into consideration in hiring? That partly depends on the institution and the position. SCs constantly use ""fit"" and ""culture"" when deciding who to hire. How is recognizing the benefit of a diverse candidate any different than saying so-and-so ""is a better fit culturally for our department"". I've been on SCs where this was the argument for hiring a white male over non-white male candidates. This should, and usually only does come in when you have candidates that are otherwise equally qualified. I think valuing diverse faculty is particularly important in public schools and minority serving institutions because their mission is to serve the community. Private schools don't necessarily need to and the fact that most don't is why I was never interested in applying to any of them. 30) The logic underlying many arguments here shows a presupposition that members of underrepresented groups are less qualified for positions. That's more than a little disturbing x5. 31) @30: No one is saying URMs are less qualified for positions. What some are saying is that many universities now have policies or specific searches that in some instances mandate hiring URMs whether or not they happen to be the best candidate in that particular search (e.g., see thread below). In searches with such mandates, unless the best candidate is a URM 100% of the time, then some fraction of the time a URM will be hired that is not the best candidate. That is math, and implies nothing about the quality of URM applicant pools (which I'm sure we all agree are excellent). It is these searches (and only these searches) that anyone on this thread has objected to. 32) I think you might have missed the point there. 33) 31 here. @32, I don't think I missed the point. The topic of this thread is ""Are people upset that departments would hire candidates specifically to add gender or racial diversity?"" That is exactly the scenario I'm describing in 31 (i.e., scenarios where departments hire candidates specifically on the basis of gender/race). Commenter 30 (and a couple of the other commenters) seem to want to twist the arguments made on this thread to sound bigoted, so that they can avoid engaging with them intellectually. 33) Its not intellectual to observe that a debate around bias has revealed the exact implicit bias that led to the debate? It is brilliant. 34) It's clear that 30/33 is not interested in engaging beyond ad hominem platitudes and slogans. But I guess it was a matter of time before this discussion devolved into people saying 'you disagree with me, therefore you're racist.' No point in debating with such a person. Reasonable people can read through the thread, and decide which cases have been made convincingly and not. 35) ""Oh no, someone is sullying my libertarian echo chamber"". 36) Did you consider that it may be you who is unreasonable? Claiming that someone called you racist or is attacking you ad hominem, escalating the rhetoric when someone points out flawed logic, and not really considering anyone's point except your own. You may be right that it is not worth your time to participate in this thread, but I think the main reason for that may be your own intransigence. 37) OP here. I just wanted to point out how civil and constructive this conversation is. I know it gets heated, but compared to any internet thread I have seen (especially anonymous ones), you folks rock with the civil discourse. 38) Well said OP/37. Having said that, I think it bears the constant reminder that, while we all know discriminating on the basis of gender is flat-out illegal and wrong, the exact same goes for choosing a female over a more-qualified male because of gender. Maybe I'm being too emotional, but being a man does not mean that my life has been any easier, or that the gears have recieved any more grease than anybody else. Anyone who thinks I've had it easier than them just because I'm a man is making ridiculous generalizations, assuming they know a lot more than they do, and is every bit as sexist as all the sexists in all the departments that we've all heard about. x7 39) Well, since you're a man, you haven't experienced misogyny. People do not assume you to be less qualified on the basis of your gender. 40) I'm a guy, and it doesn't sit right with me to see wealthy white women get preferential treatment over other underrepresented groups. But I've also seen and heard some of the stuff women have to deal with - just a bit - because I took the time to listen or ask. I'm certain there's a lot more out there I was never looped in on or never bothered to look for in the first place. It's entirely possible for hiring odds to bend to favor women candidates at the same time as women in science still have to put up with s*&t that men don't. But if men can push to eliminate all the bad stuff women and minorities have to deal with in this process, I have faith that we'll be in a place that's not unfair to men. 41) Goes without saying that affirmative action should be looking at multiple intersecting identities. Misogyny and racism affect people's publication records and CVs, and as long as that is true, screeching about ""lowered standards"" for minorities is disingenuous..  42) If someone has a bad CV, it may be because he/she suffered racism/misogyny. It also may be that he/she had some personal calamity in his/her life (which is not limited to women or people of colour).  It may also be that he/she is just a crappy scientist.  Given that they don't know the applicants' life histories, hiring committees should judge applicants based on the evidence put before them (i.e., their CVs) not what gender/ethnic groups they happen to fall into. x4. 43) They know plenty about the histories of undrerepresented groups, and they should take that into account.  44)  I suppose you're right.  All women are a monolith and women from affluent families definitely have a harder go of things than men from poor families and the women need to be given an extra helping hand.  /sarcasm  FYI, what you're saying is the exact definition of sexism and discrimination. 45) And all those ""crappy scientists"" are going to end up in the viable section of the candidate pool? Please. No one is talking about CVs that are actually weak here. Given that there is no reason to assume that personal calamities just happen to disproportionately befall white men, but we know that structural barriers do affect other groups pervasively, your logic is unpersuasive. 46) Sorry, 44, it's not. It's a better way forward to a system that truly gives everyone a decent shot. I'm sorry if you feel hurt by what's going on, but the point is to prevent unjust factors from weighing down certain groups. What we have now isn't perfect, but it's moving in the right direction and improving on a worse system. 49) Balancing out injustices isn't giving a ""helping hand"". 50) If you read ""prevent unjust factors from weighing down certain groups"" as ""balancing injustices"", you're willfully misinterpreting things. x5. 51) 49 here. I was addressing 44, not disagreeing with 46. 52) poor white woman here. Personal experience. I can't think of anybody I've met in academia who didn't assume I'm ""affluent"". They're wrong. I am still paying for my own education, and it would be truly difficult to afford a family. Generally speaking, being in EEB, being in academia at all, is not a luxury lifestyle. But for a working-class kid, having a job I actually enjoy the majority of the time feels like a major acheivement, and I'm proud of this. Should I use my time and energy explaining myself to people? I resent when this happens - why should I have to talk about my personal background - it really *shouldn't* matter. And if I do bother, most people don't wan't to hear it, or totally don't get it, or both. Some of this might ring true for you, poor white man? Anyway, guess what, I definitely have a competitive CV. But I still might end up wondering whether I was offered a job over somebody else with a strong CV literally because I was a woman, or just because they figured I'd be a better deal. Or, if somebody else got the offer because they have a better ""fit"" than me for some hard to label reason, or if it just seemed like they'd be a better deal. All possibilities and I will probably never know. Anyway usually I don't say any of this because I'm pretty sure I sound like a whiny b*%&! Thanks for listening 53) Hey dude who keeps deleting sections of conversations, you do realize there's a version history? 54) Addressing the first question, I personally am not upset that departments would hire candidates to add to gender and/or racial diversity. I've seen this in action, and almost always, the diversity hire has a stellar profile. I find it hard to believe that departments would sabatoge their productivity for a candidate who wasn't capable, just because they check a certain box, but maybe it happens. Some of the searches I've seen ended with no diversity hire, but a wonderful hire nontheless, suggesting that for whatever reason, they did not find the exact profile they were looking for... but still found a great candidate to contribuite to their department. But again, this is only my experience and opinion :) dawg","timeline for declining offer I received two job offers about two weeks ago and both are good, but I think I prefer one over the other. Wondering when people think is an appropriate time to decline? A position for my spouse is the most important thing to make an offer attractive, and it's going to take a few weeks to figure out what the exact offer is for him at either place. I assume it's appropriate to wait and find out what that is in both places before declining? The chair of one department is pressuing me to move quickly but seems to understand my position that it's impossible to compare the two offers unless I know what the specific spousal accomodation is. Am I being reasonable about this? 1) Firstly, congratulations on the two offers! Awesome news. If the chair is pressuring you to move quickly, then you can use that to pressure them to quickly give you the spousal details. Make sure that both sides know that you have a competiting offer and they would have to move fast and get you the best deal they can offer you. 2) Decline whichever one I'm waiting on the first candidate to turn it down. Kidding, congrats on the job offers! x2","Why can't the committee chair just tell you when they're going to make a god-damn decision? Or at least give you a heads up when they're not going to give you a decision by the time they said they would? Maybe I'm more anal than most, but I've now gone through two situations where I was told they were going to make a decision on day X. All day (all week actually) I'm on edge, checking my phone constantly, until 7pm Friday night, because the school is in a different time zone. And nothing. Nothing. It frigging kills me. Now I have to wonder, did they give the job to someone else already? Did they hit a glitch like they said might happen if they happened not to give me a decision on the day they said they would? How hard is it to send an email saying that they haven't made a decision yet? I undertand they can't give a day-to-day account of their decision making process, but an occasional update over a long, drawn-out process sure as hell would go a long ways. 1) Usually this meant that they offered to someone else, and are waiting for the first choice candidate's reply. Officially they cannot reject other applicants yet, in case the first choice candidate rejects the offer, so they can move to the second choice. These decisions usually aren't delayed, because of the tight deadlines that the search committee has to meet in order to make sure they do not have a failed search. x 2) Been there many times OP. It's super annoying that the SC doesn't at least update candidates that an offer has been made. 3) #2, in many instances, they cannot update candidates that an offer has been made even if they want to. But if you email them after a certain decision deadline has passed, they will say something like ""the search process is still going and things are going through the systems here, and they will update you as soon as possible"". This is an indication that they have offered their first choice but the candidate has not signed the contract yet. True story. Happened to me. 4) The short answer is, we are expendable 5) OP, thanks everyone. I'm so gullible. I always think to myself, ""oh, they've just been delayed, I've gotta get the offer any day now"". I'm the gullible guy waiting for the call from the girl who's moved on. 6) @5, apt analogy"," I had a phone interview about a month ago, but I haven't heard anything since. This week I saw that my Interfolio application is suddently imcomplete and that it needs a few more documents like teaching evaluations. Even though I gave up hope for this position a while ago now I'm wondering whether I still have a change for a campus interview. Should I contact them to ask what the situation is or just wait? Is it possible Interfolio automatically added these new required documents to the Interfolio applications of all phone candidates, but that they only contacted the people that are actually invited for a campus interview? 2) I'd say just wait (although I know it's hard!)","First time SC member (untenured).  Senior prof stopped by to try to get me to sidestep HR scoring guidelines and circumvent the search chair.  Ick. 2) Fun (sarcasm). Seeing how people behave on a search committee shows one the pettiness of it all. I'd be careful about circumventing HR, especially if you work for a state university because a number of laws often require HR to do things certain ways. 1) Rest assured I'm not caving.  The search seems more important than letting this person just get their way.   And yes, there could be a lot at stake even beyond how we build our department. 3) Ick!  Presumably senior prof did this because they have a favorite candidate.  Sometimes the faculty meeting when SC presents proposed shortlist to entire department can get tense when Sr. Prof has a favorite they want bumped up onto the list. Don't cave; be vague with Sr. Prof; and then be careful (read the favored candidate's file & have clear reasons why they got score they did according to HR's ruberic). And since you're pre-tenure, be circumspect, let tenured members of SC address Sr. Prof's favorite candidate's qualifications if at all possible. 4) Look out for yourself first. If tenure is going to be a hurdle, do what you need to do to get it. I won't judge you. 5) Were these guidelines related to diversity goals? x2   1) These guidelines are related to fair hiring practices.    Update: admin intervention to get search back on track or get a new committee member who will follow guidelines. ","Offers and COVID-19 Anyone else dealing with anxiety about offer certainty in the face of COVID-19/economic uncertainty? I've accepted an offer but the official paperwork has yet to be signed. I'm having nightmares that it'll fall through with all this craziness. Am I just being paranoid? 2.)  I on-campus interviewed three weeks ago (1 of 2). I'm terrified as well. It's not just you. I actually wanted to post this very sentiment, but you beat me to it. Is anyone a search committee member that could provide some insight? I'm assuming delays, but the funding for a new position was already secured in advance? 3) Agreed, very nervous- I got invited for on campus interview supposed to be next week, it's now all virtual via ZOOM including my class lecture. I'm also scared that if an offer is made that it could be halted due to COVID and possible hiring freezes/economic uncertainty - worst year to graduate with my doctorate ever. 4) Having not gotten an offer this year and sort of decided that next year would be my last attempt at a TT job, I'm really worried that there won't be a job market next year. Now is the time when those searches should be getting approved. My university has already frozen new hires as they deal with the crisis and I'm worried that freeze will extend even after the crisis with the economy heading the way it is. Plus I'm now home with my two young kids and transitioning to online teaching so its not like I'm going to get a lot done in the next months to make myself more competitive. Obviously not the biggest concern given what is happening to the world, but it really sucks. The good news for those above is that at least at my university they are finishing out all faculty searches that were started and finalizing offers. I'm at an R1 though, I wouldn't be surprised if the fallout from this sinks some small colleges that were already in shaky financial situations. 5) I declined a TT offer this year, now I am seriously regreting it 6) I'm still waiting to hear back from a campus visit, with another video interview scheduled. I also just got offered a postdoc. Current employer is about to stop paying me. Guess I'm signing the postdoc contract and hoping they don't freeze the hire before it goes through.. 7) Some schools have delayed second visits for candidates to whom they are making offers and extended their offer deadlines, meaning that the 2nd, 3rd, 4th place candidates may have to wait a really long time to get a final decision.  Again, a small problem relative to the state of the world, but I know from experience that it's brutally difficult to live with that uncertainty for weeks and months. 8) Yes I have high levels of anxiety with everything happening and it's interefering with my ability to prepare for my now Zoom interviews. I don't feel prepared to give an effective lecture remotely, and I do worry that previous candidates will have a serious advantage over us that are remote. It's possible I don't land a job this year due to the virus. Unfortunately that's life. 9.) #2 again, thanks for the replies everyone. Also, good luck to those interviewing remotely. 10) We just got a word that our uni halted all hires (faculty, staff) if they have not yet progressed to the level of a verbal offer. We dont know how long this will last, but unis are preparing for long-term financial hit. 11.) @10: What type of uni are you at? Just curious. Also, does that mean the positions are cancelled or just delayed? Nevermind, just read the final part. 10 again) I'm at a big R1 12) sorry to bombard with questions! public or private? 13) @10 :O!!!!! 10 again) Public R1 14.) Siiiigh, well to quote a wiser poster than me, ""Unfortunately, that's life."" OP) To clairfy: hires that have a verbal offer are still proceeding? I have an offer that I accepted officially via email. I recently completed hiring paperwork as well, I just don't have signed paperwork/contract. I feel like it's pretty secure, but I'm not sure. 10 again) I cannot speak for any other institution but my own (and even for my own, the situation is developing so fast that changes to the current policy might be made any day). At the moment, we're told no hires unless verbal offer has been made. If verbal offer has been made, proceed with written offer. if not, suspend search.  11) I can confirm as a faculty member of a university senate that everything is developing very quickly and no one has any idea what is happening because it all changes so rapidly.  We were told that COVID-19 represented an ""existential threat"" to the university.  Given that it's not even clear that universities will be able to open in the fall, funds from tuition and from government have both got to be extremely uncertain at the moment.  In my opinion, unless you're applying to a Private School with more money than God (Harvard, Stanford), you should definitely NOT count on having a job this fall, even if they've already accepted you.  I think a lot of universities are going to have to enter restructuring, recommend early retirements, cut faculty (esp. pre-tenure), etc.  (Or maybe we'll all get lucky and the unions will let the universities fire some of the tenured dead weight.)  And the immediate push for all universities to go online means that the landscape has now completely changed, perhaps permanently.  Anyone can go to U Wisconsin now, for example, without having to leave their home in Montana.  I think this all may leave a lot of SLACs out of business.  Luckily, the economy is totally in the toilet right now and working is forbidden, so it's unlikely that prospective students will be seeking out work rather than entering university.  But this shutdown is going to be a game-changer for higher ed. 12) @11 thank you for sharing, and that's absolutely devastating to hear.  I guess a TTAP position was not in the cards for us this year. 15) Signed an offer last Wednesday - the same day most universities in my area shut down.  Feeling very fortunate to have squeaked in on time (hopefully), but yes, the future now feels very uncertain... 16) i just got a verbal offer and am negoiating, but i feel like the uni is trying to strongarm me into asking for less because of this. i also have a two body problem and i'm really nervous that it won't work out and my spouse and i will end up living in different countries... 17) I received an offer, signed the paperwork, the university has received it, and last week I complete the request for a background check. I assume the job is still moving forward. I don't want to tell my current university or my landlord that I am leaving and have things fall apart. How safe do you think job is? Should I continue as if I am hired? I know I am fortunate to be asking this question. 18) If hte place you accepted the offer is on good financial footing I would guess you are still safe. Small school that is already on the edge of financing I'd be less certain.19.) Is it safe to assume that anyone that interviewed, but hasn't heard yet that the position will be cancelled? I interviewed in mid February, so it hasn't been that long. Is it okay to ask the SC head if the search was cancelled through email or just wait it out? My funding ends soon, and I have to make some big decisions fairly quickly... 20) I'd email the SC to be sure before assuming anything! Some searches are cancelled, some are bad at communicating that they've selected another candidate, some are delayed. 21) I got three 'failed search' and 'cancelled search' emails today, ambiguous about being covid-19 related but I am guessing, one search of which I did a campus interview for. I am feeling very anxious about not being able to find employment this year. 22) I'm getting the impression some searches are continuing, so I wouldn't write off ALL searches this year as cancelled beacause of the coronavirus. There is a lot of uncertainty right now. The only thing we can do is continue with the interview processes, wait to hear back, and start to make alternative plans in case a faculty job doesn't materialize 23) I just did a campus interview (via zoom) for NTT 3 year contract  job on Monday and asked about possibility of the process freezing/being canceled, they responded that any active searches can continue but postings that haven't been reviewed may be canceled. If the position has the classes on the books for fall then that role will need to be filled (was their answer).  24) lots of variation. some searches cancelled, some paused, some continuing. my R1 is continuing all started searches, but pausing all who have not started phone interviews. much depends on how urgent teaching needs are for next year. OP again) Just saw the university that I got an offer from put a temporary delay on personel actions. Waiting to hear if it affects me. No one reached out to me yet so maybe that's a good sign? 25) unofficial list of schools with hiring freezes/pauses etc. here - some have details added it (e.g. some re 30-day pauses, others are continuing with in-progress searches but susepending all other hiring, etc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KohP4xZdN8BZy1OMeXCAGagswvUOWpOws72eDKpBhI4/edit 26) How do you guys think the current situation is going to affect the posibilities of negotiating spousal hires? I am in negotiations/ sencond ""visits"" with several places (others already cancelled the search) and hoping to negotiate a tenure-track job for my partner as well. 27) Ugh, that link just made me lose hope of even having another postdoc when my current one ends... 28) was told by the committee that I was top candidate but the university has frozen all new hires at this time. It sucks. 29) In response to 26- I am currently negotiating a spousal hire (non TT though), so I think it is possible? Maybe bring it up with the chair and see what they think. Also, when you say you are doing 'second visits' - are they virtual? I'm still trying to figure out what to do about that. 28) I have negotiated spousal hires for my wife (non-academic), This last time for my TT position, we halted as our current university offered to allow her to work remotely at a higher salary. She's a grant writer with a high success rate; so she thankfully always has good luck finding jobs whenever we move. "
"Univ of Toronoto Thought folks would enjoy the very thoughtful rejection email from UofT: ""...The Search Committee has now had the opportunity to review all the applications and regretfully, your candidacy was not successful...""   Not very tactful.  I have received an offer and bites from all other places I replied to this year, but I found this msg to be a bit harsh, particularly this quoted first part.  An email like this to someone that has not been successful with any of their apps this year, could really make someone feel bad.
  1) Oh wait, but what about the fact they said ""we received many excellent applications, including yours,"" shouldn't that have made us all feel better about that fact that our candidacy wasn't successful. I too have had other bites and interviews this year, but the letter still made me feel bad. At least they addressed to it to me specifically, rather than saying ""Dear Candidate"". (2) I thought the worst thing was the advertisement below the letter that talked about how great U Toronto is. ""The University of Toronto is also a great place to work."" Regretfully, you won't be joining us in our Canadian academic utopia. 3) I'm not sure what's so bad about this e-mail. Your candidacy was not successful, what else can they say - ""it's not you, it""s me""? I understand how hard these rejections can be (I've had my share) but I wouldn't read anything into this as being especially unkind or tactless. In any case I'm sure it wasn't meant to be harsh, no rejection can really feel very good. (4) I would prefer, ""Dear Dr. Candidate, Thank you for your stellar application. Unfortunately, we feel that you are too good for our little school. We wish you luck in finding a position at an institution that is more worthy of your genius."" (5) That's hilarious #4, I would only add: ""The search committee would also like to apologize for wasting your time. Please accept the enclosed $13.99 gift card for a case of Natural Light. Enjoy!""(6) What, do you expect a hand tailored letter? Why would any search committee take their time to do this? Why does it even matter. I would prefer a simple, ""No."" That is more than enough. 7) Although 4 and 5 make good suggestions :) i think as long as the rejetion doesn't come on a postcard that says ""Were you kidding"" I'm pretty happy (8) Really, this letter is not that different from most letters I received. And I received a few to many this year. (9) To me, it sounds like your wounded sense of entitlement, rather than a poorly worded rejection letter. You should consider yourself among the most successful and desirable applicants on the market. 10) Hmm, I thought this was the Whineing page, where we are supposed to Whine about things like rejection letters. I don't think any of us expect to get a beautifully worded, kind rejection letter, a rejection is, no matter how you phrase it, a rejection. However, the point of this venue, at least in my understanding, is to Whine and inject a sense of humor and shared experience into the whole difficult process. Now we are getting a hard time for doing that. Geez, #9 do you really think we are talking about ""our wounded sense of entitlement"", are you kidding?! I can guarantee you that I have no sense of entitlement, have had my share of both good and bad responses, I understand the perspective of SCs (as I've been on one), I've worked my ass off to get to this position, and I recognize that everyone else here is in the same boat. Entitlement! Give me a f$*&#ing break! (11) Seems like an overreaction to #9, who was merely Whineing as well.

12) I propose that #10 was Whineing about #9, #9 was Whineing about the OP, and the OP was Whineing about another rejection letter (which we've all accumulated a great number this year, I'm sure). I think this is strong evidence of the efficacy of the Whineing page. Thank you to all for your participation in this study. (13) OP here - It certainly wasn't a terrible letter. correct. I simply think getting rejections is a sensitive issue and yes, i have had other rejection letters that are very nicely written. I do think the subtleties matter, and think SCs should try to be thoughtful with their wording. It doesn't hurt to do that. (14) To OP: don't worry, dude. After a couple years and several dozens more of rejection letters, you'll be numb enough to not take it so personally and focus on more important things instead. (15) Last year I got the following rejection letter from Portland State: ""We are moving forward in our process and your application is no longer being considered for this position"". Seems on par with what the OP received.","John Carroll Any word on John Carroll? I have not heard anything. (2) Sent an e-mail inquiry (3/17) to the Search Chair his reply (in part): ""Our search process is still under way which is all I can tell you at this point."" Sounds like they are in the final stages of the search to me.  (3) Offer accepted. ",NA,NA,NA,"are there any guidelines for negotiating?  How do you as an individual approach negotiations when offered a position.  I've read plenty of articles saying to request things, but none that really provide advice on how to know if you should push an item hard and how hard to push on any given item that is negotiable. 1) A good piece of advice I received was to pick one thing that is the most important to you (e.g. lab space renovations, more start-up money, a spousal hire, higher salary) and make sure you get it. You will not get everything (e.g. great lab, more start-up, higher salary, a job for your spouse), so pick one and accept the rest.  2) Here's my approach: Remember (and remind the Dean) that you each have the same goal, which is getting you into a faculty position at their institution.  You must remmeber this at all times: They now want you, and you are helping them actually land you.  So, your job is to give them an honest accounting of what you need to make that possible.  Ideally, the Dean's job is to do everything he or she can (within reason), to get you what you need.  The emphasis here is on what you NEED, not what you want.  The cornerstone of successful negotiation is honesty, and if you're able to convince the Dean that you really need what you are asking for, then you're going to be in good shape.  If you're able to establish this rapport and this tone of principled negotiation, then the institution will work very hard to get you what you need.  They may not be able to meet your requests, though, and may have to offer you, say, a smaller startup package.  This is where the true negotiation comes in.  When something like this happens, you now have the fall-back position that you're not being offered what you need.  Stick to this point, and ask what can be done to make up for the smaller startup, since this could negatively affect you in ways x, y, and z?  Maybe a teaching release?  Maybe an extra RA position?  As long as you're being honoest with yourself and the institution, then the negotiations won't get personal since (again) you're all trying to achieve the same goal.  Ideally, you will also be able to find an advocate in your new department (search chair or department chair) who can help you make your case, help you understand what is and isn't possible, and back up your resuests with the Dean.  Not all negotiations work this way, but I'd say that this is the ideal.  So to answer your specific question ( how hard to push), if you can honestly make the case tnhat you NEED what you are asking for, then you can push as hard as you want, as long as you've communicated this point effectively.  Of course, there is still the possibility that the institution simply can't afford you, in which case you have a decision to make.  But you should always feel comfortable pushing for what you need (and you should always be careful pushing for more than that).  Good luck!","I ""love"" schools without a clue what they want, so they make the ad really broad (""ecology"") then select 3 people for the short list who are all working in the same area. If you wanted someone working in that area why didn't you just post an ad for that to begin with rather than getting the collective hopes of 100+ people who didn't make the cut?! Or better yet, decide what area you would really want (for teaching purposes or collaborations) then post a narrow ad that attracts only those applicants. Otherwise you just look like confused assholes. 2) This can also be caused by warring search committee members. Confused assholes is a strong possibility though. 3) Maybe the schools know exactly what they want...the best candidate they can find. So, they make a general job ad and see what comes in. If no one is a super star, they probably just go with departmental needs. It's kind of like the NFL draft. Do you take the best player or fill needs? However, how do you know if there is a super star out there without getting every candidate possible? Either way, someone is going to be pissed off...in this case, you! 4) Here's where the NFL analogy, and the whole ""fit"" argument, become ridiculous in this day and age. In the NFL you have to go with the best fit because you only get to play with the players on your team. In academic research you can play with anybody, anywhere, anytime. So if you want to take the three best quarterbacks in the draft, and you already have Tom Brady, you can do that and they can all be rockstars leading hugely successful collaborations all over the world. Skype and other networking methods make it so the person you want to work with on the other side of the planet is just as accessible as the person down the hall or across campus. This isn't 1990, but unfortunately many search committees are hiring like it is. Any department shortsighted enough to hire someone because they ""fit"" in a way that might help a few faculty members analyze their data in the next few years has missed the boat. And don't tell me it's about ""fit"" for a course you need taught. Any school that rejects the best scientists in the applicant pool because they ""really need someone to teach mammalogy this fall"" is making an even bigger mistake. Any top ecology candidate that is half decent at teaching can adapt to teaching what is needed. Let's stick to how academic hiring is supposed to work; a job comes up at a place where you know a lot of people and they hire you because they owe your PhD advisor a favor. 5) NFL analogy also pre-supposes people on here watch football and know what you mean. 6) Wow, #4, it is sad how little of a shit you give about teaching, even if you are gunning for R1. Shame on you. If those undergrads you don't care about at all weren't there for an education, you wouldn't have the chance of a university job with nice facilities for doing your research. Some people really have forgotten the main purpose of a university. 7) #4 again, take it easy #6, you missed my point. I have a ton of teaching experience (with high student evaluations and multiple awards for it) and I take it much more seriously than most people at R1 schools, and it probably hurts my chances when they see how dedicated I am to teaching. My point was R1 search committees don't give a shit about teaching (Most will admit they don't even look at teaching statements. Read the blogs about how search committees work, they are blunt and I appreciate it) until they are looking for an excuse to say you weren't the right ""fit"", and then suddenly that landscape ecology course is the most important thing on their agenda. That's all I'm sayin. Relax, I'm on your side.  6)  I'll continue your rant.  How about positoins that advertise they want A, B, C, and D, and then hire someone who has none of those things and barely qualifies based on the ad?  Saw it happen at three different universities for faculty positions, and then it happened with a research position.  ITs all a charade. Ihavenoideawhatnumberwereonanymore) There's one person on the Anon Quals page who applied for 75 positions this year and got like 14 interviews. Says he applied and interviewed for plenty of positions that were shaky fit at best and many places are really flexible in the end. Crazy. What's the point of job ads then? I've been very carefully selecting where to apply because I figure that with so many of us on the market they are sure to find an excellent person who also fits perfectly and has experience teaching every course they want taught. This is partly because I feel bad asking my references for so many letters. <--- Exactly! At what point do you start cringing asking for more!more!more! letters because unis haven't all figured out to long list people and ask those ones for references... Next #) I have heard more than one postdoc say we should have a system where we all have all of our qualifications on a searchable database (you can update it anytime you want) and then universities can go through and ask the 20 or 30 people they like to apply and have letters sent. They only really consider 10 candidates as it is, so why not weed them out before making everyone else revise their application over and over to fit meaningless job ads and ask for the 70th letter from your poor PhD advisor. Mine says he doesn't mind and he understands, but that doesn't make me feel any less frustrated every time I ask. Next) #4 again. I think that person on the anon quals page has it figured out. We are all throwing darts in the dark. You might as well throw as many darts as you can because you never know when a search committee is going to move the target and decide you are exactly what they want. ","federal jobs Just asking around here. Do you think that age is a factor in the hiring of tenure-track assistant professors? 2) To a point. Late 20s to 40s I don't think there is much of a difference. But to be honest, I've been on search committees when people in their 50s - 60s roll in for campus interviews and they are not received well. 3) Uh, I'm 52, just got offered a tenure-track asst prof position (yay).  I didn't even start my PhD until I was in my mid-40's. 4) congrats to 3). How about the length of a postdoc? Would someone who had done a 8 years postdoc still hirable?  5) I was on a search committee at a former university in which one of the check marks were specifically age.  I informed them that this was illegal, so they eliminated the question.  Yes, age bias is present but years since PHD tends to be more of a factor than actual age. A lot of dumpy schools prefer to hire new graduates who are more easily taken advantage of. 6) Yes I think this is a major factor. However, I believe it works something like this: oh x person is 7 years out of their PhD and has a solid resume, but y candidate has much less experience and pubs, but I think their potential is much higher. This form of bias often has little grounding in reality and is driven in my opinion by the ""what's behind door #3"" mentality. Older candidates are oftentimes at a disadvantage becuase their potential has filled out more. SCs are expecting the moon nowadays and no one can keep up the super star pace for a decade alone. This is especially problematic when you consider this is the age peiod when people are building lives (families etc). Better to be a young blank slate.  7) The young blank slate / door #3 approach has apparently been around for a while. That would explain search committees full of associate professors choosing from young candidates who already have CVs that rival those of the associate professors. It's frustrating enough to get beat out by someone objectively less qualified. But it's much worse to find out you were more qualified than most of the hiring committee. 8) Definitely. Guess there is no way for the clock to go back...","Perhaps we're supposed to have kids during hiring, but not while trying for tenure.  Anyone know where I can find a good price on a rental family? ","Interviewing while pregnant 1) Anyone have any advice about interviewing while pregnant? I'm not showing yet, but I get super tired in the evenings and I worry that I'll look like a zombie towards the end of the day. Would telling the search committee ahead of time cause people to be a little more understanding during an on-campus interview, and would it be reasonable to ask them to not push the interview activites too late into the evening? 2) Various perpectives here: http://theprofessorisin.com/2012/02/16/pregnant-on-your-campus-visit-a-crowdsource-project/ 3) I just interviewed at 5 months pregnant. Good news: I got my energy back a few weeks ago, and I allowed myself some extra caffeine during the interview days. I was pretty much a zombie months 3-4, so I can sympathize. Tips based on my experience: Ask for a bathroom break between every meeting. Seriously, it will give you a breather and make sure you don't get uncomfortable. I did request one dinner to be earlier by saying that I only needed a half hour break instead of the 1.5 hr break, if the dinner hosts would also prefer to make it less of a late night - that way you're potentially doing them a favor as well. You don't need to say why if you don't want to, and you don't need to apologize. Wear comfortable clothes and shoes. At this stage, I found clothes that were just loose enough that paired with a blazer, it wasn't entirely obvious that I was pregnant - this allowed me to decide if I wanted to disclose my pregnancy during 1-on-1 conversations, vs. it being obvous. A few months from now that won't be an option anymore. Bring several clothes options with you because at a certain point things might suddenly not fit or be comfortable! I haven't had problems with morning sickness, but its best to pack a few ""emergency"" meds to carry during the interview in case you feel nauseous, get headaches, or have heartburn or bowel discomfort. Ask your hosts to keep you hydrated - carry around a water bottle or ask for one frequently since you can feel dehydrated and lightheaded much more quickly during pregnancy. And pack whatever you need to feel comfortable and get a good night's rest! Good luck! 4) Thanks for the advice, I really appreciate it! I actually just got back from my first on-campus interview and it was no problem (I'm 4 months now, and my energy came back after 3 months, thankfully). We'll see what happens when things get more noticeable... 5) I just interviewed while pregnant too (2 months along), and although being tired is a daily problem, the interview kept me energized and I didn't actually crash until I returned to the hotel in the evening. I did feel a little weird about not partaking in a glass of wine with dinner (I didn't want to seem like a prude), but I jusy blamed it on jetlag and no one seemed to care. Drinking lots of water helped a lot, but since you will be moving around every 30 minutes, it keeps your blood pumping and fights off exhaustion. Go forth pregnant academics of the world and conquer the job market!  6) My advice (male asst prof at an R1 here) would be, IF this is going to affect your performance, tell 1 person who seems friendly, early on in the interview, such as your faculty host. If you're 'off'', especially in the evenings, and nobody knows why, they may assume it's you, rather than your condition. At the same time, obviously, this is a protected status that is supposed to NOT be a part of the evaluation. Also I'm not sure this is the right advice for all situations. ",NA,"assistant professor hire Any advice or experience for somebody negotiating a second asst professorship? I have 4 years at the asst level already under my belt, and I'd like to negotiate a shorter tenure clock. 2) Just tell them that up front. They'll either get it or they won't. If they dont get it or won't write it down, think twice about going to that place. 3) I moved a couple years into an asst prof position. The new school suggested that writing in a shorter tenure clock was risky because then you're stuck with it; you should reset the clock and come up for promotion & tenure ""early"" if things are going well. I agreed, but made sure the phrase ""would not be considered early promotion if going up in < 6 years"" was included in my offer letter, because some places are more demanding about ""early promotion"" cases. Everything more or less worked out as planned (although at one point I had to remind administrators of that ""would not be considered early"" clause). 4) the correct way to argue it is that you are wanting your pre-tenure time at the other institution to count toward the new one, not that you are asking for something free.  The time spent at the other institution was used teaching, researching, service, skills that will serve you well at the new one.  5) 3 again.  If you do want a shorter clock, 4 is correct. Call it ""staying on my original clock"".  If you do, one other issue to consider is to make it clear what is expected of you for promotion on this shorter schedule.  Some people will want to see that you've successfully established your new lab / research program / teaching at your new university before they promote.  Lots of other people besides the dept chair weigh in on promotion & tenure (the departmental P&T committee, all senior departmental colleagues, the college P&T commmittee, the dean, the provost), so it's important to get the expectations clearly defined in writing.  Another thought: if you're negotiating from a position of power, you might go for ""hire me as a tenured associate professor"" and therefore bypass the whole P&T thing! 6) I agree with 3/5, if you are in a position of power, you might try to wrap the whole thing up now if you are close to tenure at your current school. It will protract the hiring process, but if there is a good case to be made, thaht would be convienent! 7) Don't forget that the chair is not your friend, he/she probably would like the negotiations to go as easy as possible, especially if they are an administrative chair and/or answerable/appointed by administration, thus making them somewhat more insulated from disgruntled faculty. Such a chair will also be under pressure from administration to get faculty for as cheap as possible and then make it as easy as possible to deny them tenure, should they decide to do so. Of course not all chairs or administrators will be like that, but assume they will have different interests than your well being.  8) @7, this is a pretty pessimistic view. Might be true in some cases, but not common in my experience. 9) Not all places will be like that but it doesn't hurt to think that people/entities will have different interests.  10) It was pretty obvious from the beginning which chairs were trying to take advantage, which were lazy, and which were enthusiastic or supportive.  Even in places where I never got an offer.  It will probably be obvious even before you get to the tenure clock discussion which one you are working with. 11) Sounds like you have a lot of experience reading chairs - not sure many people do or have the luxury of choosing jobs based on chairs 12) OP--thanks all, good advice. Not sure I'm in a real position of power yet, they might like #2 pretty well. On the other hand, it's a place that's not geographically desirable so gunning for tenure should be seen as a positive? ","Curious to hear from people who have been on search committees recently: how common are the types of 'hidden hiring criteria' referred to in this article (e.g., dean says hire has to be a woman)? I know of four cases of this (not all at the same uni) through the grapevine over the last few years, and I get the general sense that affirmative action is becoming a major force in the academic hiring decisions the last two years, but curious as to what percentage of searches are this extreme. See article here: https://www.chronicle.com/article/Academic-Ethics-Hidden-/242381 .  2) I was on one search committee last year to hire a Canada Research Chair.  It was strongly, strongly implied by a VP that we were wasting our time if our department put forward a male candidate.  I'm not sure if this ""equity"" requirement was imposed within the university or by the CRC program, but I suspect it was by CRC.  For comparison, the search committee for a non-TT position I was on this year gave no consideration to applicant sex whatsoever. 3) My experience at an R1: Faculty often speculate that the administrators would like to hire an X, but I haven't heard any such ""hidden hiring criteria"" directly from an administrator. 4) R2 SC member for past two years; never had any pressure from administration to hire female or minority candidates.  The emphasis was largely on getting the biggest applicant pool possible, with specific efforts to reach out to schools and networks that would encourage underrepresented applicants (e.g., contacting people at HBCUs, hispanic-serving institutions, and doctorate-granting schools with strong record of graduating underrep PhDs).  In both cases, interviewee list was gender/racial diverse, so wasn't an issue.  However if we had an interview list of all white males, HR would likely have requested specific justification for why other candidates weren't suitable. 5) Making the applicant pool as large and diverse as possible is great (I bet few would disagree). I however have seen two searches with hidden criteria. In one case, prospective male candidates who knew members of the SC were being quietly told to not bother because the Dean had told them there'd be no job if they didn't recommend a woman. In the other case, potential female candidates were being contacted by SC members and told that the department really wanted to hire a woman. Both were at R1s    6) I had all kinds of people tell me they needed to hire a woman but in the end they hired someone who did not check any diversity boxes at all. 7) for comparison, I must ask how common is it (now or in the recent past) for administration to silently favor hiring candidates with degrees granted from their own institution? Or more softly put, applicants with a favored pedigree; this was noted to be commonplace in the cited article. 8) @7, as an interdisciplinary person, I get the strong impression that this varies widely by field. Some universities love to hire their own in some fields, but in EEB, I think the reverse (people try not to hire their own) is more common. 9) Served on SC twice in the past couple of years (R1). We do want to promote diversity, so we try to interview equal number of females and males. However, in terms of hiring, we just picked the best candidates (top 2 in our case). For both of the years, our female candidates got highest scores. However, in year one the female candidate declined the offer and we hired the second best (male).   10) @7, my impression (anecdotal) is that preference to hire someone from one's own institution varies.  Smaller schools may seek to do it because having a degree from that institution shows you already have a connection, and you're not just using their uni as a stepping stone to somewhere bigger & better. I doubt R1s care very much at all unless a major hotshot is retiring and really wants/needs one of their former students to take over their lab. 11) Ivy league schools are notorious for only hiring ppl with ivy league degrees. Harvard goes so far as to require that a facutly member has a Harvard degree prior to receiving tenure!  12) This is an admin position but clearly relevant to this discussion: http://nationalpost.com/news/canada/dal-restricts-search-for-new-vp-to-racially-visible-indigenous-candidates  It's not clear to me at all how this is legal. 13) Then go ask a Canadian lawyer. 14) This is actually legal in Canada (unfortunately, IMO), but not in most of the U.S. 15) Zero out of 157 TT asst profs of ecology (or allied fields) hired in N. America to positions advertised in 2016-17 were hired where they received their PhD: https://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2018/02/22/where-did-recently-hired-n-american-tenure-track-asst-professors-of-ecology-get-their-phds/. True percentage is surely not literally 0%, but it's surely very small. ","negotiations I recently interviewed for two positions, and was told I would hear about both jobs by the brginning of April. I found out about a week ago that I'm pregnant, which is exciting but unexpected, and assuming everything goes well, I'll be due in mid/late November. In the event that I get offered one of the jobs, when should I tell the search committee that I'm pregnant? I don't even have my eight-week appointment with my doctor to confirm all is well with the pregnancy until mid-April, which would be after I would theoretically have to respond to the job offers. Is it acceptable to tell the search committee and ask to delay my start date until January instead of August? Can an offer be revoked if I'm not able to start when they want me to? Any insight would be greatly appreciated! 2) Would they actually expect you to teach the first semester? 3) I understand how stressful this must be, but I think it's not worth worrying about until a bit later. Wait for your 8 week appointment, give yourself a chance to get excited. At that point, if you need to disclose it as part of a negotiation, then I think it's wise. I don't think they can rescind an offer for pregnancy, though I'm not sure they techinally have to accommodate it either (federal law is that they have to give you some time off if you have worked there for at least a year). But I would like to think most schools would help out - you could potentially teach the first part of the semester (team teach, perhaps?) and then take off from Thanksgiving to the beginning of the next semester, giving you a good amount of time off while not having to delay your start. Or maybe they would just let you delay. I think there are plenty of creative solutions to this, if you find yourself needing to offer up other possibilities. And in the meantime, congratulations!  4) I think, wait until the end of 3 months before telling chair.  In negotiations beforehand, ask about materinity leave policies, and you could ask in such a way so as to give the impression that your questions are more than hypothetical, but the general rule of not telling until end of 3 months, seems like a reasonable one here as well. 5) I agree with previous posters. What sort of schools are these? If they're teaching institutions where you'd be expected to teach 3 courses this fall, that's very different than if they're reserach universities where you get a semester of teaching release in your first year anyway. We didn't tell lots of important people in our lives that I was pregnant until around 15 weeks because it was kind of nice to enjoy it between me and my husband for a while. Congrats!! 6) I've seen this happen before. Once you sign the contract, you are contractually obligated to do what you signed on to do and they are contractually obligated to provide you the benefits of the job...nothing more, nothing less. If you don't negotiate a late start or a semester with no teaching ahead of time, and the university only offers a 30 day maternity leave, then that's what you will get. If you want the whole semester away from teaching, you should try to negotiate that in advance. If they are smart, they will say no teaching the first semester. It will be more of a pain in the ass for them to try to find someone to cover your courses for your maternity leave than to just make adjustments to the course offerings ahead of time. And yes, if you play hardball and say that you can't start on the start date, regardless of the reason, they can say that both parties couldn't come to an agreement on the start date and not hire you. They have every right to do so. Hopefully you are dealing with a department that really wants you and is willing to not offer the courses or hire an instructor for a semester to accomodate your needs. Good luck and congrats on the offer and the baby. Ps, my friend who was in this situation signed a contract without negotiating anything ahead of time, showed up pregnant, and when the time came, took her maternity leave as provided for in the faculty handbook. Pss, and no, they can't rescind an offer because you are pregnant...that's descrimination. Psss, I was just talking to my friend...the big thing she advised if taking her path of just showing up pregnant is the notice you must give. Her faculty handbook says 30 days notice for maternity leave (as does mine). 7) OP here - Both of the jobs are at schools that are mainly teaching, so I would be expected to teach the first semester. Thank you for all the feedback! It gives me a lot to think about. 8) Hey OP, I'm in literally the same position except I knew I was pregnant at my interview (6 weeks along). The advice I got was to not say a word until I accepted the job offer. Legally they can't do anything because of your pregnancy but I was worried they'd find some other reason to rescind. I accepted the other day with the assumption that I'll be teaching this fall with a due date of Oct 15. I am waiting until my 13 week ultrasound to tell the chair. I will let you know how my situation goes since I'm a little ahead of you. Congrats! 9) I am in the same situation as well, due in October. I was 6-10 weeks during 6 interviews. After the dating ultrasound at 10 weeks, I emailed the schools at which I had already interviewed, and simply told the other two during interviews, that I would either remove myself from consideration or require a delayed start date. Another component to this is that I am high risk due to prior complications, and already went through the process of identifying a high risk doctor that I like, so I don't want to find a new doctor in the middle. I have received offers from 3 of the 6 schools, and I am anticipating at least one more. All have been incredibly understanding, and appreciated honesty about the situation. ","PRO tip: Don't blow off the graduate students on your interview!  Good god-- just because they're not faculty-- you should still act like they matter! Filter on, guard up, smile on your face, interested in how you could make their life better.  We ask our students what they thought of you, and if you blow them off, even in subtle ways, they will tell us.  In fact, if anything, they can be even more quick to harshly judge a candidate than faculty.  We just had a super tight dept. vote for whom to offer and #1 slipped to #2 after that candidate's grad lunch carelessness came to light. 2) I have an example of the opposite situation happening. The one candidate who got no votes from students, because they were standofish with grad students, was the one who got the offer and eventually accepted the position. Regardless, you should always be nice to students, not only because you're putting up an act to get the job. x2 3) What did the candidate do that was ""careless""? x 2 4) didn't ask grad student anything during lunch, didn't show interest in grad life in general, made a comment about how they expected their grad students to work unreasonable hours 5) Thanks for sharing  6) To me, this is insane! I always found that the grad students so so helpful. All the faculty know to be on their 'best behavior' but grad students will inevitably give you honest insight into how the department functions. If they feel supported and are happy, then this is a super positive sign about how well the department functions. Or, if you get any whiff that the grad students can sense there are major departmental politics, then this is always a huge red flag. 7) The offer I'm currently considering came from a place where at my meeting with the chair, he started it by saying how highly the students had rated my job talk, and transitioned into talking about what the students I had lunch with had to say about me.  I've been on the other side of that too; when my PhD program was hiring someone a few years ago, the candidate chosen was picked in part because she was the overwhelming favorite of the students, and the search chair told us that our student input had been part of deciding whether she was choice #2 or #1.  If it's a good place to work, *everyone* you interact with matters; faculty, students, office staff; waitstaff at dinner (not that the waiter will be filling out an evaluation of you, but the people at dinner will note if you're rude or dismissive).  The department is trying to evaluate whether they are going to want to work with you for the next 30 or so years if everything works out, and even 7 if they don't.  A whole lot of us would rather work with someone who is slightly less of a rockstar but is collegial and pleasant than someone who will publish an extra paper during the tenure process but be prickly or demanding to interact with. 8) I have seen a candidate slip out of the #1 position and effectively lose an offer for treating office staff poorly.  As (7) said, how you treat people is noticed and important.  I also once saw a candidate's ego get them in trouble and cost that person an offer.","UK vs US My experience this year: UK: 10 applications, 5 on campus interviews.  US: 76 applications, 2 on campus interviews.  Are the US really so much more competitive? Or there are other factors in the game (e.g. UK does not care about Nature/Science papers, which I do not have, nor about pedegree [I did postdoc with a junior P.I.])? 2) Are you currently in the US, UK or elsewhere? Any connections to either location? 3) OP here.  I am postdoc in the U.S., while I did PhD in Europe (NOT UK). I had zero connections in any of the UK places where I was invited.  I had instead connections in both of the 2 U.S. Departments that invited me. 4) UK unis absolutely care about high-impact papers (because of the REF), but I think ppl from the US have other advantages in that they often enter with independent research programmes and teaching experience. Perhaps the comparatively smaller startups and salaries also dissuade people from applying? There is also the prospect that Brexit will result in the UK becoming a Mad Max-esque wasteland. 4) OP. Here.  I have been invited to interview also at some of the Russel group Unis (i.e. their Ivy league) and trust me, they get many applications. 5) It's a stretch to equate most Russell Group Unis with the American Ivies, but even the lower-ranked Russells get hundreds of applications for a broadly-worded advertisement. 6) Agree with #5 Russell Group are very good but they are more like US R1 than Ivies. 7) That doesn't change the fact that they still get hundreds of applications. 8) Same experience here, I have applied to many more US than UK positions and I have had more success (well, on-campus interviews, no job offers) in the UK. For example, I have had an interview in one of the big two UK unis, but still no on-campus interviews in the US. 9) I feel like I don't see many UK advertisements; where do you all find them? 10) @9 www.jobs.ac.uk ;) A Brit here. I've had the opposite experience, more interest from the US than UK for interviews, (although I'd prefer to be in the US in tailor my application pack accordingl)y. The UK universities are definitely comptetive especially so with the REF system but it could be that PhDs take 3 years (research only) then you transition to a postdoc. For a PhD and postdoc you don't necessarily need any funding / scholarships. So it might be that if you did your PhD in the US and took 5 - 6 years (therefore more / better publications) and have teaching experience as a TA and have some sort of funding then you're more competitve than a lot of the candidates who went through the motions in the UK system. 11) I've had 4 interviews in the UK (I am from the US), but they all eventually went to UK citizens, who I think have an advantage at the interview stage.","Who likes people who get jobs and then complain about it on Twitter? And then complain that they might not get tenure becaus they enjoy teaching more than research? Anyone?  2) I've got an acquaintence who loved to make the point that he didn't really care about his job, he just happened to be good at it.  He'd much rather be a musician.  But oh here's my paper that I didn't really care about but I just happened to spend 2 years on it.  Then he said his spiel to a Dean after getting a great job offer.  The Dean said if he didn't care he shouldn't come.  The conversation spiraled and the Dean pulled the offer.   Schadenfreude. 3) Ignore people on twitter. All they do on there is brag and complain. 4) Twitter is the worst. 5) @2 Doesn't sound like he is very good at his job - he should have stuck to music...","Applying to the same department multiple years? I'm a non-traditionally trained eco/evo biologist, and this is my first cycle applying. I applied to a few math/physics and one long-shot, crazy-dream bio dept. I ended up getting an on-site interview at the evo department, and fell absolutely head over heels for both the field and this department in particular. I got really really nice feedback from the faculty after thank you notes ('can't wait to see you again!', 'so excited to follow up', etc.), but in the end the position didn't work out, and 'fit' and 'distance from EEB' was cited. I know these things are complicated and behind the scenes who knows what went on...but is it reasonable to think that I could spend the next year or two grounding my future research plans closer to evolutionary biology and try again at this department with better success? Or should I just pack it up and move on? It felt like the *perfect* place for me -- everyone was wonderful during my visit and I felt at home, I ended up starting a collaboration during my visit, it would solve my two-body problem, it is close to my family, the list goes on... 2) On one of my interviews I meet with a faculty who said she interviewed in the same department three times before getting a job. 3) It all depends on whether they advertise another job that you fit for though right? I would 100% apply again if you can, but I wouldn't change anything about the direction of your research program just for this possible opportunity (unless you are just convinced you want to move in that direction anyway, which is different). OP) #3: The search this year was down to two candidates (myself included), and nobody got an offer in the end...so I'd guess they will readvertise it soon-ish? (But it also seems like they've run this search a few years running without offers, so I'm not sure at all what's going on...). And yes, the visit made me realize that I am far more inspired by questions rooted in evolution. #2+#3: Thanks a lot for the input! I'm a bit devastated right now but am trying to focus on the future. 4) I applied for a job in a department, didn't make it past the first round, then got invited to take a VAP in that department. Applied for a TT position the next year with a completely different research proposal and got an offer. Things can change! 5) I applied for a job in a department - didn't make it past first round. 6 months later the position was readvertised - I was a finalist, came second, they asked Dean for a second hire (wasn't possible). One year letter I have signed my offer letter - a joint position in this department. If the ""fit"" is there, it could work out for sure. But I had several interview inbetween and there are LOTS of nice places, departments and research directions. I say keep applying widely and if this place is meant to be, it'll happen. OP) Thanks everyone! I wonder how the fact that nobody 'beat' me changes things -- it's not like I was second choice and just missed the cut...they just hired nobody (for the third search cycle). Why do failed searches happen? If you like a candidate but are worried about their future work 'fitting' in the department, why not just try them out and then not renew -- isn't that the whole point of a TT position? 6) I don't know any departments that view the several pre-tenure years as a ""let's see what happens"" stage. They invest a great deal in faculty, and so there's a large cost (as well as an opportunity cost) if the person doesn't fit. A visiting position of one year might not matter as much, but there if a TT position doesn't work well, it's a huge loss to both the department and the faculty member. No one wants that. OP) Fair enough!"
"U Penn Got one of the kindest rejection letters I've received to date.  Not anything major, but even going so far as to have a pdf saved with the last name of each rejected appicant had to be time consuming.  Much nicer than the generic letters with no names that translate as ""you suck so bad that we don't even have the time to let you know that your level of suckiness is different than the level of suckiness of the applicant pool as a whole.""  All joking aside, it was a pretty thoughtful rejection.  Thanks, U Penn! 1) That is sweet! I wish I had applied there...

Due to an illness, The Department fo Biology at Cornell College is suddenly in need of an instructor for a course schedule to begin April 5 2010. We may also need an instructor for a course to begin May 2. Cornell College classes are taught in blocks lasting three and one half  weeks. 
See web page for info: http://life.mcmaster.ca/~brian/evoldir/Jobs/CornellCollege.2mnth.instructor http://life.mcmaster.ca/~brian/evoldir/Jobs/CornellCollege.2mnth.instructor",NA,NA,NA,"Teaching Requirements Survey - I was wondering what the teaching requirements are for those at SLAC and MS-level institutions. I would be interested if folks could list their requirements or requirements they have seen during interviews. I am particularly curious as to how labs are counted. I often see the notations such as 2/2 but I find this notation confusing. I am guessing that this means 2 three-credit courses for 2 semesters but how are labs traditionally figured into this? Thanks! 1) The load SHOULD include labs with equal weight to lectures. The idea is that 1 ""course"" is equal to 3 contact hours (NOT CREDIT HOURS) per week. If you're teaching 1 lecture and 1 lab, that's 2 courses, i.e., 6 contact hours per week divided by 3 contact hours per week per course. But beware! Department chairs at regional/SLAC schools may hide the true teaching load by excluding labs from the course load they quote to you. This is a total racket because labs take up just as much of your time as lectures, especially if you factor in all of the grading! When you go on an interview, always make sure to ask other faculty how many lectures AND LABS they teach every semester, on average. If the department chair quotes a different amount, or generally tries to throw smoke in your eyes with confusing administrative-speak, take this as a red flag. The best indication of how much you will be teaching is how much the other faculty are teaching. Don't think you can get some sort of a sweet deal that's better than the other faculty because you're just that awesome or something. This is is extremely unlikely and such a feeling is probably just a dellusion. The more parsimonious explanation is that the chair is not being straight with you and that your load will be higher than s/he is telling you. Bottom line: ask the other faculty how many lectures AND LABS they teach (excluding buyouts or weird arrangements with the administration -- MAKE SURE YOU TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT!), and that is your true expected teaching load. 2) I typically teach two courses (3 hrs of lecture per week for each course), each with labs (2.5 to 3 hrs, once per week, for each course), each semester. This is typical for me and my colleagues. We're expected to have two publications for tenure, one of which could include work done prior to the appointment (but published since arriving).  Large externally funded grants count because they're peer-reviewed.  Of course, odds of getting those are lower so it's more rational to focus on the pubs and use smaller external or internal funds to do the research.  Big grants will buy you out of some teaching, and my colleagues do get big external grants (NSF, NIH) on occasion. In the beginning, new preps are hard, especially with labs, but once you've got your course skeletons done, the teaching/research balance seems manageable to me, especially with summer time for research. (3) Regional state liberal arts: 4/4 (12 contact hours, generally half lecture half lab) with expectation of limited research; Private small masters: 2/2 (6 hours) with sub-R1 research expectations 4) I'm at a top-10 SLAC, load is 6 contact hours per week per semester (i.e., a lecture course with two lab sections per semester will fill this load).  (4) every school is different.  Some give you 1 contact hour credit for 1 lab hr, some 1/4 contact hour.  I think 3/4-2/3 is most common.  In all, this is the most unfair part of teaching in science.  Labs are more work than lecture, not less.  (5)  At a regional M.S. level school and our teaching load floats around 9 contact hours per semester, but we are supposed to have 12 contact hours.  The extra 3 hours are made up by listing us as instructors of record on labs taught by grad students.  Labs here are 3 hours long, so one lecture and two labs is 9 contact hours.  Some teach much less than this for some reason (some buy out their teaching time with grant and other monies) and some teach a little more, but I've never seen anyone actually teach more than 12 contact hours/semester.  It's all a bit much when you are also expected to publish out the wazoo and get major grants.  When I went up for tenure with about 20 pubs, our chair indicated that that was below normal for someone at my stage and he tore me a new one for never getting an NSF grant, even though I had gotten about $300K in other grants prior to tenure.  These M.S. level schools are expecting more and more from folks in terms of research, but the teaching load is still high, so you're expected to teach a lot, get a lot of grants, and publish a lot.  No easy task. (6) I taught 18 hrs regularly in Louisiana, until I bought out my salary. 7) this is very helpful. One take home msg is that 12 contact hours will be normal maybe towards more teaching load...","I can't take one more colleague saying ""You are the most qualified person I know. I can't believe you aren't leveraging multiple offers by now."" It is amazing how many people in our own field don't know what the current job market is like. Take a look at the CVs of some associate professors you respect. Look at what they had accomplished by the year before they started as an assistant professor. There was a time, not that long ago (maybe 10-15 years), when a couple of good publications and a little promise could get you an R1 job. Now many of those associate professors are less qualified than the top candidates in the applicant pool, yet they are charged with selecting among us. Pick me, please! 2) I'm in the same boat.  I'm a tenured Associate Professor with over a million in competitive grants, decent pubs, and a lot of teaching experience and my letter writers don't understand why in 3-4 years of looking for a new gig that I can't get a new job.  I find myself asking all the search chairs why I didn't make the short list, but the most popular answer this year is simply that I wasn't the best fit.  The market is flooded and I'm drowning.  Maybe it's time to suck it up and stay some place I don't like.  idk anymore. 3) This post was spot on. I've been a postdoc for 7 years (and I still haven't had one campus interview). When I looked at the CVs of three of my advisors, I realized that my CV was just as good as their's when they got jobs, yet I can't seem to get one of these jobs. I've applied for over 230 faculty positions and I'm sick of this whole processs. I'm getting out of academics for sure if things don't work out this year. Life's too short and there are too many other things you could do with your life. 4) OP again, I share your pain #2. ""Just not the best fit"" is the only answer you'll ever get. However, I went back recently and found three people who got jobs I applied for last year. They average about 1/3 of my publications, 1/2 of my teaching experience, and not even close to my research funding, professional service, or outreach. In case that isn't frustrating enough, none of them ""fit"" the job description or the apparent needs of the departments any more than I do. I think ""fit"" is code for a lot of things they can't say and we'll never know. Here's to both of us being that perfect fit somewhere soon, and everyone else scratching their heads in confusion. 5) I have been in a search for 5 years with over 500 applications. I have had a lot of phone interviews but almost all are from lower tier schools. I am an associate prof in a low paying school. I have worled hard to get out but I can't. It is clear that my age is a factor in not being selected and I am getting older every year.","Georgetown U Marine Ecologist I learned on the same day that I got picked for an on campus interview, and that I'm pregnant! Yay!!! But that means I will be interviewing at 7.5 weeks, when morning sickness is likely to have kicked in. Tips for hiding it? Not feeling sick? What to say if someone clearly suspects I'm pregnant if I'm sick? Has anyone here been through interviews while pregnant? 2) Claim the flu. A couple of colleagues did this, but women in the department will be harder to fool. I am a fan of full disclosure, but pregnancy is one of those very bizarre topics in academia. Regardless, congratulations!!! And good luck!!! 3) Wonderful news on both accounts. Morning sickness is pretty variable in terms of when it kicks in and when it occurs, so it may not be an issue. That early, you will not be showing and nearly everyone to whom it may occur you may be pregnant will not ask. The good news is that you only have to conceal it from most of the people you'll meet over small chunks of time, and they can be easily distracted into speaking about themselves if you need a break. 4) Congratulations!  You can see if your doctor will prescribe anti-nausea meds.  I found sea bands helped a little, sometimes preggie pops (sour candy), sometimes candied ginger, sometimes snacking throughout the day (not having an empty stomach), sometimes running out of a lecture to throw up..I can understand not wanting to tell people you’re pregnant—especially this early in the pregnancy.  However, if I got sick during the job interview I would probably mention it. Being at a family-friendly institution is important to me.  5) Didn't do an interview while pregnant, but I recommend sucking on sugar-free hard candy when you feel nauseous, peppermint worked wonders for me.  It might not be super professional, but it could eliminate the need to explain getting sick. Hopefully strong smelling foods at restaurants won't make you nauseous. Good luck!! 6) I recommend refusing to admit to them that you're pregnant. Say you have the flu, say you're nervous, whatever, but deny deny deny. The giveaway will be when you're at dinner and don't drink. Even still, make up an excuse, even if it's flimsy. As much as I want to reassure you that our colleagues in academia are enlightened about women in the workforce, we all know that exactly the opposite is in fact the case (i.e., your search committee/department will be dominated by old white men with very Eisenhower-era views on this matter). But congrats on the pregnancy! 7) I hate to agree with the ""deny"" crowd, but (as a woman) in your shoes, I would deny. I want them to judge me on my science and my abilities. I wouldn't want them to fixate on this matter. Land then job, delay your start date. Go get'em girl! Congrats on both! 8) Congrats to you.  I interviewed while I was 7 months pregnant and so it was completely obvious.  You have the luxury of hiding your pregnangcy from potential employers now and I would highly recommend you do so. I was also invited to interview while I was in labor.  I couldn't fly out so I interviewed on Skype when my baby was 2 weeks old.  I don't think they were even seriously considering me at that point.  I had to stop the skype interview every 3 hours to breastfeed.  It was an all around terrible experience.  Now when I go to interview I even take off my wedding ring so the department won't judge me as a married woman, just a woman.  We have enough going against us, and unforunately, whether conscious or not, pregnancy can count as a significant factor for not hiring a woman.  I think once you get the job, many places have great benefits for families, so you can ask the HR department once you have an offer, but I wouldn't bring it up at all during the interview.  Stick to science and teaching. 9) I agree with number 4. Would you really want to work at an institute that didn't support you having a family? Personally, I'd wear a ""Baby on Board"" t-shirt.  8) I saw a research paper in HR that demonstrated pregnant women interview better than non-pregnant women.  If I could find the cite, I'ld post it.  So, I would just ignore your ""status"" in taht regard.  No one cares, at least no one on any search committee I ever was on.  Also, I've been passed over twice in favor of pregnant women!!!! 9) I know of one case when a candidate interviewed via Skype from the hospital 2 days after giving birth, nailed the interview, and landed the job. 10) to #9, that search committee should haave been slapped.  The last thing you should be stuck doing 2 days after giving birth is sitting in an interview.  THey should have worked with you to reschedul in a few weeks.  Don't believe the BS they dish out, they CAN wait if they want too.  11) How do you quantify who ""interviews better""? Seriously, aside from getting the job. Do you score it negatively, like those who mess up more?  12) People under more stress and more distractions interview worse.  Pregnancy is a signficant stressor and distraction.  Also, are you married pregnant or single?  Make no doubt about it, some folks will cross you off if you are preg and single  I've worked in enough places to see it. On the other hand, people who are pregnant do tend to have a more ""happy"" attitude compared to when they are not pregnant according to research.  That is a trend, not an absolute.  So it can play both ways.  It still was not right for them to ask you to interview 2 days after giving birth.  That is just inexcusably wrong. 13) Sheesh. All of this complaining about interviewing while pregnant..come on people. When my ex-wife and I were 39 weeks pregnant, I had 3 back to back interviews. I even interviewed during labor. Not once did I mention it to the search committee. Never did I complain. Focus people focus!!! 14) Thank you, #13 - this thread has been desperately in need of a man to tell women exactly what it's like to interview while pregnant. Your insight has been so piercing, so cosmically brilliant, that it clarifies everything. OP) Thanks everyone...I think. ;) I am married and we've been having fertility treatments for a long time now. I cannot delay start date because I could not afford to do so, it's a long story. It's going to be difficult becuase the position starts in August and I'll be due in late September. This is at a SLAC, so they will be relying on me to teach. So I REALLY don't want them to know I'm pregnant because they won't be able to help but worry. I'm willing (at least I think, at this point, and also able because husband is willing to stay home) to take a very short maternity leave to make things work out in the best way possible for both the university and me personally. Thanks for the thoughts on preventing barfing, folks! By the way, I think #13 was joking. I hope at least. 14) My apologies, then! Too close to the truth. You can lump me in with the people that thought Curb Your Enthusiasm was a reality show. OP) Got to see the little bean on US for the first time today! Shit just got real! Momma needs a job!!!!!! 15) My department interviewed a 7 mo pregnant woman, and it was of course very obvious. She is now my colleague in the departmet and a good friend. If people care about that, then you don't want to be there. OP) I got the offer folks!! Woohoo! Now to negotiate!!!  16) CONGRATS!!!  There is hope, after all.  Sincerely, another higher ed job seeker who just found out she's pregnant. OP) Good luck #16!!! By the way, I told the dean I was pregnant during negotiation and it totally helped me. Everyone understands the need to be financially able to support a growing family! Feel this out carefully though. I met with the dean during my interview, and he watched my teaching demo and research talk. He was really friendly and helpful in persona and on the phone when he made the offer, so I told him when it came up naturally. After negotiating and accepting, I just told the department, and within minutes was getting reccommendations for OBs and hospitals. There ARE family-friendly places out there, folks!","Lol. Last year I went on an interview and everything was great until one of the faculty members kept mentioning how great the school district was and which schools my kids should/could go to, until I told him I didn't have kids. Everyone suddenly went quiet. I was not offered the job. Haha.","Anonymous what? Does anyone know how I can tell which anonymous animal I am? It's not a big deal, but I am curious. 2) You could log in from another browser, edit a cell in the first, and see yourself on the second. OP) Thanks!","What sucks is when you have major federal grants, are at an ok institution but get no interviews at better ones. 1) No. What sucks is that there are not enough jobs to go around when there are so many good postdocs here. x3 2) Solidarity. What also sucks is when all your mentors can't understand why you can't seem to get a job , and all their advice is relevant to an unsaturated market. 3) What really sucks is that you realize if you could do it over again, you might not have chosen a career of pursuing your intellectual interests/dreams. So many of the jobs announced are goal-oriented about specific systems (lake fish, freshwater, estuarine, disease biology, etc.), so my guess (judging from what I see at my current state institution) is that universities have given up on standard pots (NSF, NIH) and are trying to keep their faculty lines open by hiring people who can bring in indirects from other sources, such as state funds. Even worse is that some of the state 'grants' come with strings attached so that neither the PI or the university own the data, which in 'red' states means that the data could be used in court cases to weaken the EPA, clean air, water, endangered species, you name it. That's what is sad. In grad school a profesor told me once that if I wanted to change the world, I should have become a lawyer. So true. 4) not to be a pedant, but you don't own the data if NSF funds it, either: https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2015/nsf15052/nsf15052.pdf - and I don't think it's a bad thing. 5) OK, but NSF is not restricting what you publish and what you don't. NSF funded data is owned by the public with no strings attached. That's a huge difference. 6) what also sucks is that most universities seem more concerned with producing as many phd's as possible to increase thier ""prestige"" than whether or not those students will find jobs.  I know at the last instutution I was at, the faculty were pretty smug about how most of their phd students were employed after graduating- but this was mainly due to temporary post-doc positions.  There was no follow up to see if the students actually found permanent positions in the field. 7) that's a problem generally at all levels, there is little follow-up how far their undergrads or MS students go in their career-getting them into Med school is one thing, but how many of them complete? Anecdotally, I know that many of our students have sort of crapped out after leaving but getting into a grad or med program, but nobody is interested in collecting that data because it would require massive change. ","insufficient applicant pool? I recently got an rejection email saying that they liked my application, but the applicant pool wasn't as large or diverse as they wanted, so they wouldn't be proceeding with interviews. I don't really understand this, can someone explain? If they got even a handful of applications that they liked, why does it matter that they didn't have 200 other ones to reject? Or maybe they didn't get any they really liked, and were trying to let me down easy? 2) Maybe they didn't get a handful they liked? 3) My understanding is that HR sometimes actually does have requirements about number of applicants and diversity of the pool or searches will be called off even if there were good applicants in a small pool. 4) in my department, 200 applicants are common, but searches in a couple sister departments sometimes only attract 20 applicants -- their searches are rather specific!","Oh my god, that's who my colleagues want to hire... UGH!  Their talk was pretty lackluster. The postdocs we interviewed were better. 2) Seriously! Applied to a job in the department where I am a postdoc. Didn't even make short list. One candidate has half as many pubs, none in flashy journals (basically the same journal quality as me) and is 5 years younger. They came last week and gave a pretty blah job talk. Not sure if that should make me field better or worse about my job search. 3) Very discouraging. Does the other candidate add research diversity that you don't? 4) @2: A lot of places (especially in the US) try to avoid hiring their own postdocs as faculty. 4) #2, five years younger is the thing. A lot of departments want to hire younger (less time out of Ph.D.) folks over folks who have a longer postdoctoral record for the ""potential""....I don't understand why....but it is very common. 5) Young person here, where is my job? X7 6) Cynical take: They know they can offer low startups to less experienced people. Anecdotally, many of the very young people I see getting hired are female. 2 again) @3, not really research diversity, but they do ad diversity I don't. @4, yes I knew it was unlikely to get hired in my own department. I still hoped that the candidates they brought in would be as good or better than me so that I could at least not feel too annoyed about it. @6, definitely not a cost saving strategy, I'm at a private school with lots of money and they are not afraid to throw money around. 6 again: I've observed a department simultaneously trying to offer a junior woman a bad deal to check boxes, claiming the slightly more experienced woman is too expensive, while trying to recruit a senior guy.","postdoc interview Is it customary to fly out for a postdoc interview? I've had two phone interviews now (one with the SC chair and the other with a full 'committee' that was a video call). Wondering if typical next steps are campus interview or if i'll just get an offer/rejection notice. And if they don't schedule a campus visit, is it reasonable to request one? It's a 2-5 year position in a place I've never been with people I've never met. Would be nice to see the place and meet in person before committing... 2) I think both are fairly common, but my sense is that just a phone/skype interview is more common than a full campus interview. The difference is that the PI is probably paying for the campus interview out of their grant, so may be more reluctant to do that than a department. The cases I can think of that did have campus interviews brought out just 1-2 candidates each. 3) It depends on the lab's funding situation and how far away you are, in my experience. I've done both Skype and full-on two-day interview with dinner. Some PIs will only interview people they actually intend to hire in person. 4) For named fellowships, a campus interview is common. For a PI sponsored position it seems to be 50/50.","Today I found out I didn't get a job I interviewed for in December.  My heart is broken.  It was perfect location for me and spouse and great Department/Uni.  2) I'm sorry. I understand how you feel. That happened to be last year, I'm still very bitter about the whole thing 3) I am sorry too. Many on here can empathize. It never gets easier to get those rejections when you have invested so much time/energy into preparing for that school 4) OP. Thanks everyone! 5) What's an interview? x6 6) I just had my heart broken too, OP. Courted by the search chair. Felt like I rocked the phone interview. Perfect location for research and SO. No campus interview. It's a brutal process. Take some self care tonight and I promise you will feel better in a few days. <3  7) OP. Thanks #6 I hear you! Take care of yourself too! 8) Dr Pepper and the broken hearts club band ..... (all I can do now is make bad song parodies and perhaps lower my coffee intake) 9) @6 do you have any idea why you didn't get an on-camus interview after phone interview? especially if you felt you did really good? Something similar happened to me and I'm trying to make sense of what happened. I wonder if it was my research that they thought was boring (or not a good fit... eyeroll) or if I was not as great as I thought I was, any insights? 10) #6 Here - They went with a more biomed focus. The job ad was ""physiology systems"" - I study physiology of social insects and argued my system can be used to study physiology of individuals and groups. Based on who they have invited (their colloquium schedule is public) they went with physiology systems of humans. I also asked them for feedback and they said that even though they could see me as a productive scientist and a great colleague, I can't cater as strongly to students who want to go into the health fields. I of course think my work absolutely appeals to those students (in fact I just had a campus interview where they said I'd have a line of students waiting to be in my lab because of it). Sucks but at least it's less personal? I generally think this is the case - they already knew your research was super rad before the phone interview! 11) @6 thanks!  12)did you demonstrate how you can use your model species to study physiology? we used to have human phys labs that used cockroaches to show reflexes and other neurophysiology.  There must be other examples of using insects to teach physiology. Cheap to do too! 13) Cricket respirometry is the one of the classic ones 14) sending lots of good vibes to all struggling in this messy 15) ....? 16) Sorry - 14 here, not sure how my comment got cut off - just saying that I empathize with everyone else dealing with this messy, strange job market. 17) I like the truncated version! 18) Getting a TT job is indeed a messy. 19) 6 Here - I totally did. But clearly not enough. Everyone they have invited has been human phys.","Dinner w/ search committee After a long day of a campus interview, you go to dinner with some of the search committee to....Applebee's ?!?! Interesting sell by the committee...what does it mean? [Not a vent, just curious...] 2) It means if you get the job, be prepared to become a much better home cook x 2 3) I don't get it. I love to go to Applebee's x4. 4) Oh no! The fancy dinner is one of the best parts of an interveiw! 5) Maybe not many restaurant options near campus? 5) Maybe it's a good sign that the faculty likes to get down on some ice cold 32 ounce BLs from time to time. Count your blessings OP 6) I would give anything to crush some BLs on an interview right now, maybe get an app sampler for the table? 5) Don't think much into it. Last year my university was hiring 4 positions. We are in a small town so we had to start mixing in some chains because we got bored of going to the same places over and over. 7) We have some idiots in our dept who think that is fine dining and have no idea why anyone would object. Another guy didn't think any candidates deserved better dinners until they got job offers (schmuck). That's on them for sure. 8) Sounds like a great place to work",NA,"travel, COVID-19 and job searches So - is anyone else concerned the COVID-19 situation is going to bring in-process searches to a halt? Yes, academic people problems, I don't think my job search is more important that saving lives or preventing a pandemic. Practically though, I have visited several campuses already and still am in the hurry up and wait phase after phone interviews for others. . .I'm concerned about the timing. And also concerned about feeling pressured to travel because I want an opportunity when as a good global citizen, perhaps I should not. . . 2) Yeah seems likely that it will. Some universities have already banned all travel paid for by university/grant money, which I think would include searches and seminar speakers, etc. Seems like more will be following suit in the next few weeks. Maybe time to try out full scale zoom interviews... 3) I had this happen already, albeit for a position at an institution in China. The hours-long,  late night zoom process sure is impersonal, which can be awkward, but on the other hand there is a lot less down time and having to repeat yourself! Some benefits too, like easier referencing of notes. Overall it's easier to manage than a trip would be. I say that as a candidate but probably goes for committees too. I wonder if this gathers steam as a format it might allow for evaluation of more final-stage candidates. 4) As a candidate at on campus interviews, I've had quite a few one-on-one meetings with faculty over zoom while they were traveling or on sabbatical. For those most part, I've liked those just fine. I think it wouldn't be a huge difference to have all the one-on-ones over zoom. A seminar or chalk talk where you might be trying to interract with or respond to a bigger group I could see being a bit more of a problem. One benefit (I think) would be eliminating all the interview time that is spent trying to talk over meals or in cars or in semi-interview but not really formal situations. Presumably no one is going to try to recreate those over zoom. 4) Have also had this happen with an 11hr time difference, both for panel interview and seminar to the department. Agree with #3 that it worked out fine, though for me it was a bit weird to give a seminar via skype and see the slides on my screen but not the audience! Also had a one-on-one follow up with one of the faculty for general chat and questions. 5) I am on a similar situation and I am wondering how to proceed, can someone advice on whether I should wait for the department to make the decision or should I contact them and ask what the status is given the current situation. Although WHO hasn't declared this a pandemic for political and economic reasons, this IS a pandemic and it meets all the criteria. I am obviously worried about putting myself and others at risk. I will be traveling from an area that has confirmed cases. Classes have not been moved to an online platform yet, but I think it is a matter of time. What should I do? 6) This is the OP again. #5 you should definitely check in with the search chair, especially if there is travel already planned. I imagine they likely don't know what their admin may decide yet, but I can't imagine it'll be business as usual. I'm about to cancel on a society meeting planned for the end of March, but I think it will still be hard to say no to a campus invite even if I know I shouldn't travel. Technology and the improvements to accessibility things like zoom and skype have made are amazing, but I am not sure I could make a decision on a job without an actual site visit. Maybe I am archaic. 7) Two of my second visits (one on each coast) were cancelled because of Covid19. One will happen at a later time, the other through Zoom/Skype. 8) @7, did you contact the chair before these were postponed/cancelled? or you waited for them to tell you? 8) #7 here, I was contacted by the chairs. I still have 2 interviews supposedely on. Maybe I should contact the chairs. 9) I'm in a similar boat and waiting to hear whether upcoming interviews will be moved to a remote system. I don't think it's quite fair to continue the search, given that the in-person candidates who have already visited have a clear advantage over those of us unable to travel. All that down time to chat over meals and in between meetings is part of getting to know us (and us them!) 10) #5 here again, I emailed chair and apparently they are sticking to the original plan and leaving it up to me if I ""prefer"" to postpone, which really seems unfair, this isn't a matter of prefering. 11) @9, the flipside is that maybe hte other candidates down time and chatting over meals convinced the committee that they *were not* a good fit. Seriously though I'm sorry; that situation really sucks. I'm sure they don't want to cancel the search though. That is also a huge risk and unfair to all the candidates who made it to the interview stage. There isn't really any good solution here. 12) I agree that candidates who visit in person have an advantage over those who do not. Imagine if even one committee member has hesitations (even unconscious) about offering a TT job (with start up and a 5 plus year committment) to someone they have not met in person. 13) I just got a Zoom interview request that mentioned campus visits will hopefully follow in April.. depending on what happens with travel. Eeek . 14) I just had an already-scheduled fly out turn into a remote interview. It's happening, people. IMHO, departments that are still planning physical fly-outs are kidding themselves. 15) 9 here again, I still have an interview planned for next week, but one the following week has been moved to Zoom. I suspect the one next week will be canceled/moved as well, as things really don't seem to be improving in the US. 16) European travel ban should be interesting. Ignoring whether it's sensible to travel for a moment (prob not). 17)I am in a similar situation, on-campus interview next week at school who has cancelled in person classes and is essentially at the epicenter of one of the US clusters...I spoke with the SC chair this morning and they are still planning on my coming as planned 'if I am comfortable', which I am totally not but this position is my first choice and I absolutely love the school/department....so conflicted??? I know I would be at a disadvantage if I don't go. 18) @17, if I were you I would still go (as the chair is still comfortable with it), but you may need to seriously cosider isolating yourself when you return home. Also keep an eye on the news for any new travel restrictions before next week. 19) I had an in-person interview rescheduled as a zoom visit. It went surprisingly well, and all of the faculty were in the same situation of having to transition to everything being online too. I'll be honest, giving a seminar to a screen instead of a room of people was awkward, but I think it was ultimately fine. Most people practice their talks while looking at their screens anyway! Couldn't do anything about it, and I think it's a needless risk to everyone to fly for interviews, even if the campuses are closed. Hang in there! 20) you know what I wish ? we could have a virtual zoom meeting to discuss this in person - i just got asked to visit a campus for literally my dream job, and the search chair asked me to suss out the feasibility. they're willing to do it online, but it's not ideal. that plus the growing sense of dread over the risk to my parents in N America (I live overseas), and worrying that my govt is going to impose nationwide quarantine... well, it would be great to support each other, you know ? 21) I support you! I would stay away from overseas travel right now, because what if you can't get back home!? This whole ordeal is not ideal, nor is it fair to those of us who waiting so long for these shots at these jobs! I'm trying to remember to be grateful (our situations could be so much worse), and it's helpful to know that #19 had a positive Zoom experience. (Still bitter about not being able to see the campus and facilities in person though). 22) #19 here, yes I was bitter about not being able to see the facilities and meet students in person too. It was less than ideal for sure, but then so is a pandemic. x2 23) I was just offered a position last week and I'm in the negotiation stage. I'm not sure what to do about the second visit. I want my partner to see the location and make sure he likes it, but I obviously don't want to put others at risk by traveling. And they want the offer signed by April, so I can't delay the second visit too much. One option is a really long road trip, to avoid air travel. Really not sure what is best. 24) Even by road trip, the city might be shut down enough to not get a great feel for a place.  25)  Are universities even physically open still?  What's the point of visiting a ghost town in person? 26) as someone who had to make a final decision somewhat blind, i think it's useful to see the place you might be living for the next several years, even if it's not running as usual.  With that said please be safe, prioritize health and minimize interactions!"
"Trolls Beware of trolls, folks.  Notice the ""Antagonistic comments are encouraged""  I don't think that means it is ok to antagonize one another ",Mississippi St. U Any update on the 2 positions in Biochem?  on-campus interview finished (3/5),NA,NA,NA,"600+ job posts on this wiki, this has to be an all time high.  I wish more of them had updates, but hey, I get a lot of people could save a lot of time if they looked here! Are there really more jobs, or are we just adding types of jobs not put here before? a&P, community college, etc.  feels like a bit of both. 2) A&P and CC jobs have always been up here.  This year there are frankly far fewer A&P jobs than most years, but there are more CC jobs than usual.  3) Just add a note, jobs teaching at CCs are often better (both financially and professionally) than those in other subjects and at other levels.  In many states CCs have better funding, no more teaching responsibilities and less service expectations.  If you don't need a personal lab or you have access to one, then you can do a lot at a CC if you put your mind to it.  Further, if you have a bad year, no one is going to harp on you for not getting those papers out this year. 4) That's one job posting for every applicant to the UMD position! 5) I've been coming to this wiki for a few years, and it does feel that we have more non-ecology related entries than before. I can see including A&P or CC jobs, but there also has been quite a few molecular, cell, microbio, etc. positions lately. My understanding is that there's a separate wiki for those more ""lab-oriented"" positions. But I guess I'm not particularly against being more inclusive here. <--there used to be, but it is not being used this year, not sure why.  There is also a neuroscience one.  However, it seems that a few of the ecologists on here tis year have serious molecular skills explaining the rise in those.  ","I'm sick of this. I'm tired of hearing the anger, hatred, and angst in my partner's voice. This is my last year searching for an academic job. If this year doesn't work out I'm dropping out. I'm not sure what I'll do, but I'm putting my family first. 2) I'd like to hear how you plan to keep a family without a steady job. 3) Right, because everyone here has a ""steady job."" 4) Right #2 - because the only steady job is an academic one 5) 2 again. Read the OP's post. He/she has no idea what he/she will do afer quitting academia. I'd like to hear how many success stories people have about turning from academic to non-academic, especially for someone specializing in, say, skunk mating behaviors or centipede population ecology. 6) @1, #2 is just being a jerk. there is a lotta BS in this process. I know folks who have left academia for greener pastures entirely unrelated to their expertise. Best wishes if that's the road you take - what you're doing is tough. 7) I'm currently working for the gov't and came from a very specialized field and now work in a broad-scoping office that has nothing to do w/ my original field of interest. People need to get out of the mind of ""academia only"" and realize that there are many other opportunities out there. 8) I will reiterate what other supportive people have said here. Academia is not a supportive environment for having a normal, healthy family life. The skills you build as a scientist (written and verbal communication, simplification of complex processes, management of small to large-scale projects, database creation and analysis, training of staff, teaching and evaluating student performance, developing methodologies) are highly useful and valued in industry and the government. You just have to try to sell yourself and learn a new employment structure. And to the OP, I can totally identify with your experience. I have been unable to negotiate positions for my spouse (and him for me as well). We have decided that the strength we have is from each other and not our careers. It's amazing how much better I have felt after letting go of the idea of a career so I can just allow some happiness into my life. Good luck to you.  9) Look up Michael MacRoberts.  He worked with the likes of LEakey and Dawkins, yet currently runs a private consultancy doing botanical work.  He is not wealthy. 10) But he is not poor. 11) 2 yet again. Wow, the level of hypocrisy and reliance on anecdotes from supposedly sceintists never cease to amazfe me. Oh, and also the grass is greener on the other side mentality. If you're really so miserable in academia, please, by all means quit and free up some spaces for others. I can't care  if anyone here quits academia. All I was questioning is the notion that quitting academia is somehow the silver bullet. There was a thread on Ecolog last year (or the year before) aboutless the prospects of government jobs, and insiders reveal that the competition there is no less or even more than academic jobs, with large amounts of cronyism. As for family life, many different professions can be impeding for that. It's just how you manage your time and life. In fact, more family folks than bachelors/bachelorettes hold tenure-track faculty positions. And to #6, I love you too, dude. 12) #2, you are kinda being a bit of an a-hole.  Do you have any words of encouragement?  Any ideas for biology Ph.D.'s other than government jobs and academia?  How about teaching K-12.  I had a B.S. Biology student recently get a job teaching middle school making more than I make in a tenured Master's level position.  Are there jobs at zoos?  Aquariums?  Pharmaceutical companies?  Conservation groups (Manomet, for example)?  Biological supply companies?  I knew an entomologist Ph.D. that the army kept trying to get to enlist for some reason.  Good benefits there.  There have to be other options out there, because doing this year after year without any success and only focusing on college and university jobs seems to be getting some folks no where but in a suicidal state of mind with strained home lives.  What other options can folks think of besides government and higher education jobs? 13) Just the other day one colleague was mentioning that he saw a fast food chain was hiring managers for $45,000 a year. That's more than what most postdocs and some TT faculties make. So, there you go, that's an alternative option for you, #12, if money is all that matters to you. 14) http://howtoleaveacademia.com/   15) you want things to work?  get every academic to actually stand up against the adjunctification of academia, refuse to take the positions and strike the hell out of higher ed.  ITs not going to happen because most are too ""busy"" to be bothered  I aliken it to the situation in Germany before WWII. 16) Dude #13, it's not just about money, but money is an issue.  Working a community college gig where you teach 12 or more contact hours and make only $28K a year is a concern, so knowing that there are jobs out there where you can use a degree in the biological sciences (e.g., writing grants for a conservation group if you like the research side of things or teaching K-12 if you like the teaching side of things) and still make enough money to pay the bills is not a bad thing to discuss.  ...and if you're #2, again, I think you've just confirmed that you are an asshole.  You are really a bummer, man.17) This link is even a bit more of a bummer: http://sciencecareers.sciencemag.org/career_magazine/previous_issues/articles/2015_01_08/caredit.a1500008 18) LOLZ ""future generations of young scientists may have much smoother and less painful transitions to satisfying and productive careers."" To  Get in line, bitch, and suffer like the rest of us. I don't do this for the greater good of the academy. I do this to get a fucking J.O.B. These are the rules. Play by them, and you might be able to succeed. That article made it sound like this entire cohort from thewhich I say FUCK.THEM. past 10 years or so should just accept their shitty lot and we should completely restructure the system. I mean... seriously, fuck you.19) The venting page is in full force...unbridled rage and spite. It must be nearing the end of the job hunting season.  13) to #16.  Its about money.  Lets stop lying about it.  Yes, we want to further our ""career"" and work on stuff.  But, lets face it.  This is a money issue  None of us are getting paid enough and we are not getting hired.  Those are money issues.  Pretending they are not is a lie to ourselves and others.  Yes, there are a lot of other things its about, but not making enough money to fulfill basic needs is the problem.  ITs easy to talk about alternative careers.  To take alternative careers you must be trained for alternative careers.  The alternative career option is largely not an option for most of us.  14) Rage, spite and really, really crappy advice. Yes you can leave academia. The vast majority of people do. It may take some retraining and thought but a lot websites out there to help with this stuff. You also don't have to get a job you hate - data scientisit, industry, government, non-profit etc. This wiki seriously deteriorates as the job hunting season goes on (although the absurdity and thus entertainment factor goes up!). 20) #7 again. I took a science-policy postdoc position straight out of grad schook, with zero training in anything but applied science. The expierence has been challenging, but rewarding, and has shown me that there are many other opportunities outside of academia. After this I am going to work for science NGO doing sci-edu. I'm also applying my ass off to academic positions with the hopes of taking my non-academic training and applying that as a professor to show future generations that there are more options out there than just academia (to hopefully ward off discussions on boards like this with people spouting misinformation about ""academia or bust"") 21) Good luck #20...sounds like you have had a really interesting career! It is great to hear about these other paths. None of the paths seem easy but it is silly to sit and wait for an elusive faculty position and not investigate other options. Lots of ways to make an impact and have a fulfilling career.  22) #20, so let me get this strait, you did not have training in policy, too a postdoc in policy, which by defintion is a position where you get training.  Sooooo, that is not permanent, and you now have training in an alt career, right?  23) This Friday Links post in Dynamic Ecology has a short bit about ""alternative"" careers. it is mostly for PhD students but there are some helpful links.  24) consulting with the environental consultancies is the only viable option, then you better have the proper training.  That is obtainable, but costs $. 25) Consulting is NOT the ONLY option.  There are lots of options.  Prior to getting an offer from a university, I was also made an offer to be a middle school teacher at a private school.  I have zero coursework or training from an Education Department, but many middle schools and high schools will hire folks with grad degrees and then pay to have you take any additional Education credits that you might need to maintain the job.  26) It is silly to debate this...some of us are done with acadmia. We have no funding or are tired of applying to places we don't want to live or can't move for a spouse or whatever. The career change is inevitable. The question is how can maximize financial and personal fulfillment in that ""alt"" career. Hopefully people keep posting here and elsewhere to help others see where we can go. Not sure why some assholes have to simply state that it is not an option. We heard your opinion...thanks. 27) I largely think that the ""only option"" people are those who are terrified of having to find an alt career path. I don't blame them... I was there 3 years ago mid-postdoc at an excellent research institute. It is healthy to consider alternatives. One of the best things I did as a postdoc that helped me see and consider alternate paths was attending industry meet-and-greets in the area. There are lots of ways to find these opportunities, but one of the easiest is LinkedIn. For those thinking about alt careers, try to find these events and just ask blunt questions about what is needed in an application and an interview for these kinds of jobs. Industry is constantly interviewing and looking for new folks. Lots of turnover and growth and shifting of personnel. And, in my experience, those in the business are open and direct about what they look for and give good advice about how to approach the job hunt.  28) for those looking for the elusive alternative career outside of academia or consulting, TNC has an entire 4 jobs advertised on their website.  Lets get real folks.  Add up the jobs.  You are not getting a consulting job unless you have consulting training, you are not getting on the ground conservation jobs if you are already labeled an academic, you are not getting a government job if you don' thave the courses required in the check boxes.  This is life.  The alternate career does not exist because it is the mainstream career for someone else who would rather die than work in academia.  If you are trained for a track, you are not jumping tracks barring a miracle.  For ever one person who does their are a thousand who can't and don't.  Its not about qualifications even, its about perceptions.  Consultants do not broadcast what they find, academics do.  Those two philosophies are completely at odds and the perception of a consulting agency of an academic applying is going to be very similar to the perception of a consultant applying for an academic job in a biology dept.  Likewise, government folks must keep their traps shut, they do what they are told, and they largely do paperwork for, ultimately, politicians.  This again is counter to an academic's training.  Academics are their to protect us from politicians.  Government employees serve politicians (even though they should be serving us).  I'm not saying they are corrupt, its just what they have to do to eat.  IF you are an academic, good luck getting hired in a policy-type job with the government.  Research job?  Maybe, just maybe, and even then you better have a connection.   Early on after graduation, you can make some changes to get into one of these other tracks, but you have to do it VERY EARLY.  Once you have a reputation as an academic, a consultant, or a government worker, that will be your bed and you must lie in it.  29) Yes you must lie in that bed. There is no hope. I know of 1,000 postdocs and only one has gotten a good job outside of academia. Your life and situation sucks but there is no hope. None. Don't even try. Give up. It is over. McDonalds, R1 prof, homeless or dead. Your choice","green card 1) I've seen some comments on here previously about strategizing the order of your interview, but now I can't find them.  I recently totally rocked a phone interview and then also had a great campus interview.  Was told that the process is going to take awhile, for a variety of reasons, including a couple more candidates still coming after me.  Any advice for helping them remember how much they liked me in the interim? 2) If you haven't sent your thank you emails (search chair, committee, maybe some people you met with), then that is the only way I think is appropriate. Just be sure they know you want the job and you had a great time during your visit. After that, you just have to wait it out. 3) couldn't have said it any better than #2. Thank you emails are a must.  And if you really rocked the interview, they'll remember :)  OP) Awesome, thanks!  I love this page. 4) Send them some sexts and nude selfies.  Works every time.",NA,"Two jobs at the same university? What do you all think about applying for two faculty jobs at the same institution? For example, should a person who studies computational evolutionary ecology apply to both the computational search and the ecology search at WashU, or is that risky? 2) If you fit both, apply for both.  They might be in different departments and certainly have different search committees.  When we've had such cases the search committees were supposed to ""share"" appropriate apps but why leave it to that chance? 3) Yes, I can't see any harm in applying to both. We had a similar situation when I was a grad student with positions in two departments. One candidate for the earlier search gave a good talk, but wasn't offered the job. She had been on the short list for the second job (but not the invite list) and that search committee ended up offering her the position. 4) And another similar story: https://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2015/10/14/the-hardest-part-of-academia-moving/ 5) I applied for 2 jobs at the same place, interviewed for one, and was offered it. ","Rule #1: There's always a jerk on committees and panels. 2) I agree. x3 Rule #2: there are also crappy applications, publications and proposals. 3) I wonder about rule #2 a lot - a friend of mine who's served on a bunch of SCs told me that a quarter of the applications are usually routinely tossed because they're super generic, poorly written, for the wrong position, etc., Considering the job market, this always seems shocking to me 4) Rule #3 33% of job candidates give a crappy talk, have poor interactions with faculty and students, or are unprepared. This from being on 5 searches. x2 5) @3 I don't find it shocking: there are tons of people in the world who apply for anything regardless of the appropriateness, in the off chance it works out.  It never does. 6) @5 I wonder if this is a bigger problem in the US, because all the unis use the same application format so it's tempting to just apply to everything. In some other countries, each application requires written responses to several selection criteria, slightly different for each job.","Help improve a job ad? I'm the SC chair for the position at CSIRO on line 486 of the TT page. So far we haven't had as many applicants as we might have hoped. It's in Australia, which will put off some applicants here, and it's at a research agency rather than a university, which will put off others, but it's a permenant position and pays quite well. Can anyone have a look at the job ad and tell me if we are doing anything wrong that might be putting off applicants? https://jobs.csiro.au/job/Canberra%2C-ACT-River-Ecosystem-Modeller/380365900/ Or is it just that we are looking for a rare combination of skills and experience? 2) I mostly apply for academic positions but would apply for a CSIRO position in a second (I used to volunteer for CSIRO after undergrad). However, this position is not in my area of expertise (i.e. I'm not quantitative ecology/eco-modeling/ecohydrology).  I'm assuming you have a two prong issue with people wanting to stay in their respective countries and the specificity of the ad. 3) ""Previous applicants need not apply."" That sounds a tad snobbish to me. So even when the person who applied last year got a Nature paper this year and they need not apply? Once rejected, forever rejected? 4) I think that they mean that, because this is re-advertised during the same season, people who applied previously are still under consideration and don't have to re-apply. 5) Yes - previous round closed only a few weeks ago. You can definitely apply if you've applied unsuccessfully for a different position at CSIRO in the past. 6) If you are allowed to specify that the position is open to all nationalities that may increase your applicant pool - many people may assume that because it is at a national science agency, you need to be a citizen of Australia to be eligible or have a chance - it is also a fairly specific search. 7) Thanks #6. It does say that somewhere in the fine print, but I'll ask HR if it can be mentioned more prominently.","Being an Asian does not mean Asian faculties can ask whatever they want!! Two Asian faculties (one male, one female) asked me (a female, Asian too) whether I have kids. One of them even argued with another faculty that was present at the same time, saying ""We Asian do not care about these questions."" What?!?!?! (By the way, this is a prestigious R1....) 2) wtf man 3) to #1: They are unprofessional, but not because they are asian. I understand your frustration but your tone is annoying and equally unprofessional. If you think that they treated you unprofessionally,  you are not any better because you label them separately as well. Faculty of any skin color asks inappropriate question. Shame on them and shame on you. From OP, please read the full comment. One of them, in front of me, argued with another faculty who stopped her from asking me the illegal question, saying that because I am Asian, so it is fine for her, as an Asian, to ask me that question. 4) Don’t worry OP, we knew what you meant. There is a history of at least one race-baiting person in this forum, so ready to chomp on a percieved misstep, that they either can‘t make their brain comprehend words or they purposefully misquote you. Sorry for your experience irl and in this forum. 5) OP, because you were criticized by 3, you edited your original post, which was specifically targeting a certain group. Your original, unedited post showed that you were condescending. 6) I remember the original post and also understood what the OP meant.7) I saw the original post. The tone was unequivocally racist to me as it specially points out the race of the two faculty members and the OP specially mentioned that she is not of that race. 8) She mentioned their nationality 9) If you really must vent about a candidate here, please go ahead and make another entry below, #3 10) lol what?","feedback from SC Has anyone ever received useful feedback about why they weren't chosen from a search committee? (Presumably this would only be for people who make it to campus interviews, or at least phone interviews.) I've heard people say it's not even worth asking, but of course we're all curious why we ultimately weren't chosen. 2) I think the better question to ask is why the other person was chosen. Maybe you were great, but the other person was just better. 3) Have asked several times and never gotten any useful feedback. x3 4) Through backchannels, yes. The official reasons given, which sometimes happens, are usually on the generic side.  5)  The standard bullshit answer will always have the word ""fit"" in it.  The only useful feedback I've ever gotten was from faculty members I bump into at meetings after the fact or folks that I've know in those departments. 6) I was told once it was because my PhD wasn't in the exact right field. This was despite being a finalist, giving a kickass talk and having great interviews with everyone on campus, being clearly able to perform all aspects of the job, *and* the fact that the job ad said nothing about a PhD being required specifically in Environmental Science. Like most ads they were looking for someone with a PhD in a number of fields as long as the person's expertise was in line with the position, which mine was. I would rather have been given a generic ""fit"" response. It was a lot of time and mental and emotional energy to put together an application and go interview, only to have them choose the other guy just because his PhD was technically in ES and mine's not. If that was going to be a litmust test they should have stated it in the job ad and I never would have applied. *eyeroll* 6) Generic replies also sometimes refer to ""experience"". I've received actual feedback from a committee member who liked me, someone who knew my boss, someone in the department I ran into afterwards, etc.  7) Received feedback from one place, which was great - SC offered to chat with me about the process in the rejection email, so I took him up on it. My email requesting feedback from another school (following on campus interview) went unanswered. 8) Have had a very useful and positive feedback conversation with an SC chair on one occasion. I have also been an SC chair advised by HR not to give useful feedback, as our institute got sued by a previous applicant for a different position who used that feedback against us (SC chair told them they were weak in area X and they thought it demonstrable that they weren't). 9) @8, any idea if there was a decision or a settlement in the legal case? 10) Could a SC get around this by offering advice on what a candidate might improve on next time, rather than why they didn't get this particular job?","VAP applies for within department position --> VAP doesn't even get phone interview --> VAP is asked to teach course that new hire will teach when s/he arrives --> VAP is asked to mentor new hire in course instruction --> VAP.....? 2) 🏢🔥 x4 3) Bummer. I would say quit but you are probably like the rest of us and desperately need employment. I would refuse to mentor the new hire and explain to the department your reasons. x3 4) I am so truly sorry.

That's a BS situation )9 OP here, thanks peeps. I was feeling pretty crappy about it, so it is good to know that I am not the only one who thinks this is crap.  10) I was in a similar situation before - got out of there as soon as something better came along. I know it's not easy, but they are in the wrong to do this.","First Gen So it's getting to the point where getting an academic position feels utterly hopeless. I'm sure I'm not the only one. What are some of you considering for an alternative career (other than data scientist)? Are there any one or two year diplomas out there that will ""guarantee"" a decently paying job? It doesn't need to be eco/evo-related or even science-related for that matter. 2) CS, but of course then you're entering a whole other potentially toxic (though more lucrative) field. OP) I don't mind being in a toxic field as long as it leads to a career. I'm in the 5th year of my postdoc, and I have no probems connecting postdoc positions, as I have another 2 yr position lined up. But that's another 2 yrs of uncertainty while raising 2 kids. I'm just wondering if there's other possibilities out there that I'm blind to because I've been so focused on obtaining a faculty/government research position. 3) I'm looking into climate change or susatinability consulting, though not really sure yet whether I can convience them that my subject matter knowledge is enough in the absence of any experience in actually implementing it... 4) You can make bank as an environmental consultant looking for endangered species and delineating wetlands. Depending on your skills, there are always state and fed jobs like the USGS/USDA/etc. Quantitative folks often also go work at medical or ancestry companies. Ag. tech companies are another good place to look. 5) The (legal) marijuana industry values people with plant or microbial skills. If you're near a community college, a number of programs in fields like sonography are quick and well-paying ($60K or more). I feel for your position, having been in a simlar situation. The good news is that you're enormously capable, and there are careers like that you can do fairly easily that still pay well. 6) I am tentatively considering GIS work, and possibly getting certified for this. But I still don't know much about it, how lucrative it is, or whether I'd be good at it. However, it seems like one possible option. Otherwise, pastry chef is another option. OP) Thanks for your suggestions folks! Funny that I had actually considered pastry chef, sonography tech and cannabis industry XD... I guess $60K is considered ""well-paying"" if academics at some PUIs earn $45K... 7) I didn't get a tenure track job, but am now a lecturer. I teach 4 sections a semester (2 lectures and 2 labs) and earn $65. I have a month off over the winter and from May until September, but could teach summer courses for extra money if I want to. I only need to be on campus 2 days a week, so it works well with children. Even though I only get 3 year contracts I feel the job is fairly stable. I miss doing research but I love the flexibility. 8) As an aquatic ecologist who hasn't done any wetland delineation and next to no endangered species work, no consulting company wants anything to do with me. 9) Absolutely, consulting isn't something you are going to jump into except at the entry level to learn NEPA, wetland delineation, TMDL...etc 10) It also seems like once you have a PhD you're overqualfied for any consulting jobs and they consider you to have ""no experience"" 11) Plant taxonomists may be an exception here for consulting. There's a real need for them in the consulting world. 12) @11, that must be very low paying and unstable work though, right? 11) Not necessarily. If you're a botanist and can ID T&E species, you can get some well-paid positions.The ones who can are increasingly scarce and, as a whole, their population is aging. 13) Have you considered intelligence analyst positions? I've read that analyst working for a federal intelligence agency (e.g., CIA, FBI, NSA) pretty much just write and present mini dissertations on topics having to do with national security. Many agencies have some kind of science/technology analyst position. Starting pay is ~70-90k I think, and if you don't mind living in DC/NOVA, it could be a viable option. 14) management consulting if your family life can deal with travel....after 2 years with a big firm you'd probably be able to move into a permanent home-based lead/analust/management position if you have good people skills. starting pay with your experience should be around $115K. big firms include Bain, McKinsey, Boston Consulting, Deliotte (most of the big accounting firms also have consulting arms, think KPMG etc). I have never posted anything here before but have been following discussion over a few months, but I'm about a year from finishing my PhD and I just can't get excited about continuing in academia so this topic is one of great interest to me. I also agree with the thought about intelligence analyst or looking into jobs with DOE or even DOT or something like that. At AGU last year I met a scientist from DOE and he loved his job. curious to see this thread continue. 15) Someone I knew in grad school took a position at a tech company they described as a ""gister"" -- someone leading a lab would contact their department and basically request a lit review on a particular topic, one of the gisters would then spend a few days on Google Scholar putting together a document that outlined the fundamentals and then summarizing either a couple of recent lit reviews on the topic (with citations to them), or a dozen or two recent data papers on the topic.  In between specific assignments, they'd keep up with recent literature in either their particular specialties or others they were interested in which they felt might become relevant to the company, so they could do things quite fast if those came up.  If I could do that remote, so I wouldn't have to have the insane cost of living of the Bay Area or Boston, that would be a pretty good job, I'd think.","Such a hard week. Just realized that I did not get a Skype itw for a job I had the exact profile for. I know from one insider that they thought my application was strong. Thought I was overestimated myself when I realized that somebody with a bit less pubs, and a CV not as good on any other points was invited. I know this is the case for everyone but this has been a tough year (or yearS). I submitted my applications while recovering from a major accident that happen to me at the end of the summer, I lived apart from my loved one for almost two years, I sacrificed so many things for these two stupid high impact papers, thinking that, at least, I would get a cool job and do what I like. The result? This. And I am far from friends and family in a country time zones away from them. Sometimes I don't even see the point anymore.  1) Ouch. But I'll say that things do tend to work out for most people in the end. I totally feel for you, though. I got my hopes up for a number of things that went nowhere. The uncertainty is really tough. 2) I am really sorry. First, I hope your recovery is going well and that you'll be back on your feet in no time. Second, hang in there, I'm sure things will work out for you soon. I'm in the same boat as you. Two years in long-distance relationship and counting, very far away from friends and family, living in a place I really dislike and have been here for two years but I haven't been able to make any friends (IMO their fault not mine, I've really tried but the community is really tight and closed). To make matters worse, I'm in a ton of financial distress associated to crappy postdoc salary, loans, traveling to visit loved one, and so on. The thought of not getting an offer this year gives me so much anxiety.  3) Same boat also. 5 years in a place I dislike, ended a relationship, but no interviews yet this year. And what should have been next year's postdoc funding was declined on Monday. Happy Thanksgiving. 4) Just want to chime in here and remind people to practice self love. No job is worth your sanity, or your family or loved ones (PS. My sig other of SIX YEARS just dumped me, and I blame it on my awful work life balance.) 5) thanks @4 I agree with you and at the same time, what else should I do? I've been doing science/academia for the last 15-18 y of my life. Don't really know how to do anything else, don't really have the CV to search for some other type of job. Yes, no job is worth family/loved ones, but I need to eat and pay rent, so what should I do? OP) thank you all guys. It is frightening and depressing to see how many of us experience the same things and this is not good at all. Happy thanksgiving all, hang on, and I agree with 4), we should all practive self-love and take care of ourselves. 6) It's true we need money to survive! I would suggest doing your best to land the interview/offer this year, if it doesn't happen, you could look for another postdoc if you want to stay in academia or find an industry/private/government job otherwise. After trading away time with my family and friends and realizing I lost out on a whopping 8 years of their lives, I'm going to re-think what I commit to and the hidden ""cost"" associated with work gains. I think it's good to set boundaries for yourself, since we give so much to the academic gods as it is. You are worth a lot more than the number of high impact papers that you have. 7) Just learned that commercial truck drivers start at 60k... with better hours than many academics. Perhaps not as intellectually stimulating, but then again think of all that time for audio books!","Turning down a TT job offer?  Not sure what the OP was going to ask since the cell was blank, but I turned one down for--I think--good reasons shortly into my postdoc. Now 4 years later with no other offers I still think about it. 2) What do you think are good reasons? Do you think it would've been easier to get another TT job if you already had one? 3) This is a complex and personal question that is difficult to give advice on. I would say generally, if you get an offer and have been getting interviews, you will likely get more in the years to come. So, I don't think you should feel like you have to accept any offer that you're given if it's not a great offer. Especially if you have something else lined up. It is not necessarily easier to get another faculty position once you already have one. This is esepcailly true if you are at a teaching college and are hoping to move to a research university. This is just really hard to do, unless you have enough postdoc papers in the pipeline to sustain you for the first few years. 4) But getting a job at a teaching-focused insitution is easier once you've already had teaching jobs 1) No job prospects for partner. Pretty low salary. Poorly funded grad program where I would feel guilty accepting students who are going to really struggle to get jobs themselves (was an R2 hoping to become an R1). Not the greatest location for our family for a variety of reasons. I'm sure there are lots of other good reasons too, but it takes a real toll to turn down (or to have turned down) a permanent job and still be stuck in non-permanent positions. 4.) I turned down a TT job early on in this years' market and have some regrets but it was a tough logistical situation (no support for spouse, moving countries, low salary). I have several interviews still to come so I guess I feel like I made the right call. Definetely a personal decision. 5) I have a TT offer I'm happy with but my postdoc advisors have suggested I decline and hold out for a 'better' job. Better for them means massive startup and a school with a huge endowment. It's caused some friction as I think my chances of ever getting a job like that are low and I'm not sure I want the additional stress. In the end I decided to take the offer I have. 6) #5 seems like you made the right decision for yourself. Congratulations on your position and good luck! 7) @5 for me it was more of a family decision. It was interesting to get different takes on what is a 'good' job - lots of variation in opinion. 8) I also just turned down a TT offer for many of the same reasons as #1 - I've been in this search 3 years (really turned up the octane this past year though) and hundreds of apps in, tens of interviews. . . and I worry that maybe I only get one offer, but honestly, it was somewhere I'd be miserable and wasn't enough compensation. I'm hoping it was a good choice. 9) Also turned down a permanent job, and similar thoughts to #8. I think ultimately it was the right decision but I underestimated how much it would continue to weigh on my mind. 10) One factor in my decision to take an offer was hearing horror stories from the last recession. With stock markets down 20% over the past two weeks I was bit afraid the market might be smaller next year. 11) There is no right decision in taking or turning down a less-than-ideal offer -- deciding between multiple paths forwards is always a wild guess at best "
"Total lack of contact! Ugh, someone posted that ASU sent emails saying they had made a short list. I haven't heard a word. I know I didn't make the short list, but why no email. Am I on some back-up list or did they just lose my application. Not that it matters if I didn't make the short list, but it just seems like simple courtesy to let us back-ups know something.  1) Are these back-up lists we all imagine ourselves on real?  Don't know how many times I haven't got a letter when everyone else does and assumed I was a back up, but then still never got notification after the hire is made.  Why would they notify after the first cut but not the second? 2)  In most cases, I would guess that, if they haven't contacted you references, than you've been rejected, whether you got an e-mail or not.  There are a number of places from which I never got a rejection letter or e-mail, even after the job has been filled, while others have.  My last name is at the end of the alphabet, so I figure that I'm the most likely to be forgotten or have an error in my e-mail address.  After all, why would any SC need a SECOND backup list for who they still don't have LoR's?  (3) I have gotten a backup list interview after a bombed phone interview, not at ASU, though. (4) Once you've made the phone interview, or any other short list than you are automatically part of the back up list, should the first three interviews not work out.  However, if your references haven't been contacted, or you haven't been invited for a phone interviews (in searches with phone interviews), it's a safe bet that you're not on any short list.  Many SC's have little regard for candidates that have not been short-listed, and will often not bother with sending a rejection e-mail or letter. ","Any news on UF Wildlife Conservation Any news on this one???? short list of 5, 3 interview candidates should be notified this week (3/22) 2) I assume there was a phone interview with the 5?  One more place I don't have to worry about!",NA,NA,NA,"Posters Any correlation between those who post information here and their likelihood of being hired? If you can’t capitalize school names, screw with the columns and information, can’t be bothered to spell check, etc. you should wonder why no one will hire you. (2) If you have a bad attitude, caustic personality, and tend to be petty over trivial details, and you must insert profanity into yoru posts, its no wonder why people won't hire you. 3) OP here. Well, I already have a TT job so I guess my attention to detail paid off. Also, not sure where you are seeing profanity (unless bother is now a four letter word). And 2, details are never trivial when it comes to jobs (or science for that matter). 4) I think worrying about capitalization of university names on an informal jobs wiki qualifies as trivial. I agree with your thoughts on people screwing with the columns.  5) being able to decipher between details that are important and details that are trivial is more vital than simply attending to all details.  Done, is better than perfect...it really is.  6) Apparently 2 is my 86 year old grandfather, as I believe he/she thinks ""screw"" is profanity. 7) I thought it was a fastening device.  Technically, it is profanity when used in that context. 

","Passing the million-dollar mark in funding 4 years out of your PhD... awesome; Publishing your 30th paper 4 years out of your PhD... even better; Polishing off your CV with tons of service and teaching experience... all bonus; Realizing none of it matters because the system is fucked and you'll never get a job... priceless.  What have I done?  2) You've made bad choices like the rest of us. You drank the kool-aid. You believed that this career path is merit-based. 3) OP gain, If I only I had looked up from my work long enough to kiss the right asses and massage the right egos. I tell my field techs looking at grad schools that it is all about who you know and not what you know. I should have looked in the mirror with that advise. Looking at who got the jobs I applied for last year, they all have less than half of the on-paper quals but they all come from big labs with famous PIs. Then universities wonder why these people tread water for 3 years once they're on their own. I guess the joke's on me and the universities. 4) It's also about personality and the ""management"" mentality. The people I know who got jobs right out of postdocs were not the best in their field... but holy shit did they know how to have a conversation with anyone and manage large experiments with lots of people (this is for R1 jobs). Yes they had grants and big papers, but they also could work a room. And a lot of that is definitely kissing the right asses. R1s are all about egos. They don't just want someone who is doing great work... they also want someone who is going to bring connections into the department. 5) Man, you guys just highlighted why I have zero interest in working at an R1. ""R1s are all about egos."" Yep.","handing the faith question Can anyone who has been on a SC answer this: when a posting asks for several documents to be sent to an email address, do they prefer it to be condensed into one PDF?  Or all PDFs to be assembled into a Zip file?  Or is sending them all as individual attachments okay-dokey?  I've been doing the third option for a while now, and it just hit me that maybe that's annoying for the head of the SC.  (2) Separate is fine to me.  There's usually someone else organzing the documents before they get to the search committee anyway. 3) I usually merge them into one pdf, with the single docs in the same order as announced in the posting, and name the file something meaningful: name,position number, etc. Makes it easier for the people who sort the files. In some smaller places the search chair self might be the one doing the sorting.  OP) Thank you!  Good to hear. 4) If you put everything into one doc, I would suggest having a clickable table of contents at the beginning so that the SC can still read the documents in the order they want, especially if you have a longish CV right after your cover letter. I did this for the ones that specifically asked for all docs in one PDF, but sent them as separate PDFs for the ones that didn't. A zip is a good idea.","I've totally sat there on a drive saying ""Oh how nice,"" while they showed me houses and school districts that would be great for me and my imaginary kids. ","need not apply A search chair informed me that it is against their rules for them to allow tenured faculty to apply for an Assistant position even if they are willing to give up tenure. Anyone else heard of this? 2) I'm not familiar with such rules at any place I've been. In fact, I've seen tenured faculty get interviews for assistant professor jobs.  3) I've seen them create a new assoc or senior prof position at the school when someone submitted to assistant prof position.  There are ways to get it done.  Just send the app in, especially if you have an active grant. 4) OP here to 3, Seach Chair said I could not be considered for the position which suggests that they won't even look at my application.  5) Sucks about that particular job, but if it were me I'd keep sending apps to other searches.  6) same thing at our university, we had a couple AWESOME associate prof applicants we had to throw out!  You should state in your cover letter that you're willing to be considered at asst prof level, that MIGHT have helped in our situation and can't hurt",Aaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. Crap. x11 2) *Passing the wine* 3) need something stronger than wine x4 4) Straight whiskey? 5) That's usually where I go 6)ggrrrr#$@asdlfkjasdf!!!!!!,"Human A&P What's with the outcry against Human Anatomy and Physiology jobs? There are plenty of jobs on this site that aren't 100% evo/eco, and many of us anatomists and physiologists (who study evolution and/or ecology as well) are interested in these positions. 2) I've been wondering where to draw the line in what jobs I add here, too. Do environmental engineering jobs and biological oceanography jobs belong here? 3) My opinion; post anything remotely evo/eco/zoo and let people filter it themselves, easy to scroll past job that doesn't appeal but if it stands out and gets someone a job then it's a win. x3 4) OP here - I agree completely! It seems to me that Human A&P is kind of singled out, and I was just wondering if there was some deeper reason that people keep commenting that these jobs don't belong on the list. Is it just negativity of a few people or a larger consensus? 5) Maybe they don't understand that these Human A&P jobs are mostly about the teaching duties, not the research area. 6) I'm a vertebrate ecologist that ""gets"" to teach A&P.  Those jobs definitely belong on this wiki.","Why can't we just show up in boots and field pants? Ironing clothes is my least favorite part about campus interviews. 2) Poor you (sarcasm) x2 3) I wear synthetics that will look presentable after a night on a clothes hanger. No more ironing. 4) I have a small portable steamer that I bring so much better than ironing. 5) I haven't been invited on-campus (yet...hopefully I will) and I can tell I need to go shopping for clothes when that happens.   5) Just hang them and let them cill out while you take a super steamy shower.  Or turn on the shower with super hot water with the door shut for 30 min before bed the night before.  Totally works in a pinch. 6) Also, that feeling when you go for the interview and it turns out the dress pants that used to fit you perfectly for last year's job search season no longer fit! Should have tried them on before I left. 7) I unpacked in my hotel room during a recent on campus interview and realized I packed only kid's toothpaste. YUM!  8) Got to one interview with no toothpaste, no hotel office to ask for it, no pharmacy anywhere nearby.   At the end of day 1 I got so desperate I brushed my teeth with shampoo.   Dreadful, but not as bad as losing the job over dragon breath. 9) Dresses are more forgiving than pants, I've found, provided they match your gender presentation (mainly because the only ones that fit me flare out, guaranteeing extra space below the waist).   10) If someone cross-dressed on an interview I'd probably push for my department to hire them. 11) Wardrobe planning was almost as stressful as preparing for the rest of the interview. As a short, young-looking, Latina I was explicitly told a few years back that in order to be taken seriously in academia I needed to make myself look taller (heels, but not sexy ones) and dress more professionally (suit?) than other people without my ""handicaps"". My ""professional"" pants no longer fit so ended up buying a completely new outfit that cost more than everything else in my wardrobe except my wedding dress. Now I have a nice suit I will never wear again. So much stress, anxiety, and money... but I got the job so... worth it? 12) Unfortunately, there's no such thing as unmarked women's clothing... I occasionally tower over men on campus visits in my (moderately high) heeled, conservative black pumps and people still think I look young. 13) I've had good luck borrowing a jacket or other pieces of interview clothing I didn't want to have to purchase from friends. And as a woman who is 5'10"" I wear flats. 14) For those seeking ""women's wear"": If you know what size you wear in specific brands, thredUp (and similar online second-hand shops) has a lot of ""like new"" business wear for super-cheap. My J.Crew interview suit (skirt + pants + jacket) was < $20 15) I wish more formal clothes were cut for people whose waist:hip ratio is small 16) I only fit in petite business slacks. I know because I went to 6 stores and tried on 50 pairs and the only ones that fit were petites which don't usually exist outside fancy stores. I hate women's clothes so much. 17) Had good luck shopping at Boden. Lots of dresses that are formal enough for an interview without being too stuffy.","how were you notified of a job offer? how did folks receive good news (i.e., a job offer)? cold call on the phone? email to set up a phone call, followed by a verbal offer on the phone? email offer? On the flip side, how has bad news come? For me, all of my rejections (following interviews) have come via email, and I have yet to receive good news. 2) my only offer has come by email from school director to set up a Skype during which a verbal offer was extended. All bad news comes by email or not at all in my experience. 3) <--- And sometimes this wiki. There's been a few where the only outcome I ever heard about was on here. 4) tru dat. 5) cold call for good news 6) I've had three on-campus interviews and have received bad news via email and a cold call on a Friday. The one offer I got was a cold call on a Sunday afternoon. 7) You got a cold call for bad news, #6? That's brutal. 8) I've had a cold call for bad news. It was worse because the chair could not help but gloatingly tell me about the candidate who was bringing the $3M NSF grant and was their obvious choice. In retrospect, a bullet dodged? 9) I interviewed somewhere where the dean says she'll call either way. I don't see why they'd call w/ the bad news...I guess you don't break up with someone by text? 10) Is this common, though? Do most people hear good news by phone and bad news by email? 11) Good news=call, bad news=email or nothing at all. 12) #6 here again, the cold call for bad news was horrible. I was estatic when I saw the caller ID to instantly crushed within 30 seconds. I don't know if I've ever had an emotional swing that fast or hard before in my life. I really feel for #8, my phone call was atleast short and just entailed standard pleasantries. I couldn't imagine having to hear about the other candidate. 13) #8 here - thanks. Yes! The emotional swing was excruciating and my condolences back #6. Do search committees not think these things through? 14) Cold call (that went to voicemail because I was driving), with a requested returned call and then an email also asking me to call. I got off at the next exit so I didn't crash and called back immediately. Bad news has always been via email. 15) Call that I didn't answer because I was outside and couldn't fish my phone out quickly enough, followed by an email rejection a few minutes later. 16) Haven't gotten an offer yet, but good news about campus visits has come both by cold call and by email. Post- campus interview bad news has also come both by cold call and email. The emails are *much* preferred because I more or less assume that an email is bad news. The cold call with the rejection was the worst because as #6/12 says the emotional rollercoster in the span of 30 seconds is brutal. Vomit inducing almost. I suppose in the defense of the SC chair, she probably had the ""you don't break up with someone by text"" mentality. Which I can respect, but at the same time it's pretty brutal. Especially when it's a situation where not that much time has passed so it's not unreasonable to assume that the call is coming in with an offer.  17) 15 again. SC chair thought it was more personal to call, and indicated a call would be coming. I'm glad I didn't answer. 18) Email asking to chat the next day. No further details given. Happily, it was good news. But that was a sleepless night! 19) I told this one last year but my worst was a rejection via Skype. SKYPE.  I had to look the guy in the face and battle back my tears.  Could barely talk from the shock and the lump in my throat.  I was so sure it was a job offer because why the heck would you reject someone via SKYPE?!!!  I had called my mom and told her I was going to get the job and everything! 20) Wow 19, that is rough. 21) I am still waiting for a phone call or email about a job I had an on-campus for last March....22) I have gotten about a half-dozen offers over the years. I was informed via cold-call on the phone, email to set up a phone call, and an email offer. I seem to recollect that the email to set up the phone call was the most common. OP) Email to set up a phone call led to good news, but I totally agree with #18, that was the longest 20 hours of my life. #19, I'm so sorry - that would be terrible. Note to search committees: it sounds like people prefer the email rejection rather than a phone rejection - gives you time to collect your thoughts before having to interact with anyone in a meaningful way. In this case, I think it's fine to break up with someone by text, but if you are willing to offer some feedback via phone at a later time, let folks know! 23) The worst rejection I recieved was a scheduled phone call: they emailed THREE days prior to schedule the phone call, so I had three days of anxiety followed by rejection 24) Holy crap @ #23! That's freaking brutal!! 25) Do these people just not remember what it was like to be on the job market? I don't understand why a SC would do this to anyone! 26) They probably experienced a different kind of market back in the day. 27) @23, wow, I would have needed to be in a good mood to not say something to them I would have regretted later...","I turned down a fellowship because the salary was not commensurate with living costs, at least when you factor in the exhorbitant cost of childcare. The advisor even admitted that she's never had female postdocs with young children work with her before, due to this very issue. This is why the STEM pipeline is leaky! 2) FYI, male grad students and postdocs are not infrequently breadwinners and come up against this same issue. (I.e., postdoc is in a foreign country, spouse cannot get work visa there, fellowship does not pay enough for you to support your family). I hope you are not implying that this is a scenario that only women deal with. x3 3) It seems like the only good time to have a kid is after one gets tenure: even though it is biologically impossible for some of us. Very, very frustrating. 4) Paying for two kids childcare while a postdoc made me realize why people end up staying home with kids even when they would rather pursue their career. Partner and I both academics so neither can do that without abandoning career so we pay, but it is clearly not worth it in the short term and only worth it in the long term if we somehow win the job lottery (and we are lucky to be in a financial position where we can even make it work in the sort term). The worst part is that the child care providers don't even get a good salary despite how much we are paying. 5) I turned down two TT track offers for low salary, and I think I will be leaving the pipeline this year. 6) I always think ""why would anyone want to work this hard for so little money?"" I understand that there are some perks and many feel like it is a calling, but I just can't do it anymore. 7) See post below, and welcome to the club! 8) welcome to late capitalism 9) Still better than late stage socialism, I like my dog as my friend and not food. 10) We've never seen late stage capitalism, #9, so how would we know? Maybe the rich taste good. 11) Once you realize that industry is willing to pay double for more reasonable hours and still an interesting/fun job it's hard to imagine why people at all stay in. 12) the administrative class is certainly making out like bandits...13) @2 No, not an issue that only women deal with, but the biological clock is real. Can we accept that everyone has it hard, but women often have fewer good options? x5 14) Disagree x4 15) @14... wut? 16) @14x2 Care to elaborate? 17) Ya'll didn't know... white males are rapidly becoming a minority class and now have it harder than everyone else. 18) lol you're funny 17 19) That's not funny. Instead, it's very disturbing that there are white males thinking that they somehow have it so hard now. Instead, recognize that everyone else has had it much harder, for much longer, and that now equity means that you (white male) must give up some privilage. But that doesn't mean that you have it hard. Get over yourself and try to empathize with others. 20) #17 here... I was joking. Although I am a white male, I think this upsurge in dudes thinking their oppressed, or that the struggles they face are in some ways equal to those faced by women is absolutely ridiculous. People like #14 and those that agreed need to understand that not getting the privilege that they feel entitled to doesn’t mean they’re being discriminated against. x2 21) #18 here, I got your joke @17 but I think we shouldn't joke with that 22) #13 here...I appreciate the honesty on this board, even of those who disagree that success in academia can be more elusive and come at a greater cost for women. If nothing else, it serves as a reminder that silent misogyny still exists in the next generation of ecologists. x5 23) May be off topic, but related to the OP's question. How much flexibility does the PI have in salary negotiations when offering a postdoctoral fellowship? If you put 50K in your grant budget, can you still offer a 60K postdoc salary to someone who has kids to help pay for the childcare? And would HR allow this? 24) @23, the PI has loads of discretion here; typically the acceptable salary range from HR is very wide for these positions so the only limiting factor is what their own budget would allow. IOW, the PI could offer $60K if they had another pool of money/grant from which to draw the $10K.
","Other options So it's getting to the point where getting an academic position feels utterly hopeless. I'm sure I'm not the only one. What are some of you considering for an alternative career (other than data scientist)? Are there any one or two year diplomas out there that will ""guarantee"" a decently paying job? It doesn't need to be eco/evo-related or even science-related for that matter. 2) CS, but of course then you're entering a whole other potentially toxic (though more lucrative) field. OP) I don't mind being in a toxic field as long as it leads to a career. I'm in the 5th year of my postdoc, and I have no probems connecting postdoc positions, as I have another 2 yr position lined up. But that's another 2 yrs of uncertainty while raising 2 kids. I'm just wondering if there's other possibilities out there that I'm blind to because I've been so focused on obtaining a faculty/government research position. 3) I'm looking into climate change or susatinability consulting, though not really sure yet whether I can convience them that my subject matter knowledge is enough in the absence of any experience in actually implementing it... 4) You can make bank as an environmental consultant looking for endangered species and delineating wetlands. Depending on your skills, there are always state and fed jobs like the USGS/USDA/etc. Quantitative folks often also go work at medical or ancestry companies. Ag. tech companies are another good place to look. 5) The (legal) marijuana industry values people with plant or microbial skills. If you're near a community college, a number of programs in fields like sonography are quick and well-paying ($60K or more). I feel for your position, having been in a simlar situation. The good news is that you're enormously capable, and there are careers like that you can do fairly easily that still pay well. 6) I am tentatively considering GIS work, and possibly getting certified for this. But I still don't know much about it, how lucrative it is, or whether I'd be good at it. However, it seems like one possible option. Otherwise, pastry chef is another option. OP) Thanks for your suggestions folks! Funny that I had actually considered pastry chef, sonography tech and cannabis industry XD... I guess $60K is considered ""well-paying"" if academics at some PUIs earn $45K... 7) I didn't get a tenure track job, but am now a lecturer. I teach 4 sections a semester (2 lectures and 2 labs) and earn $65. I have a month off over the winter and from May until September, but could teach summer courses for extra money if I want to. I only need to be on campus 2 days a week, so it works well with children. Even though I only get 3 year contracts I feel the job is fairly stable. I miss doing research but I love the flexibility. 8) As an aquatic ecologist who hasn't done any wetland delineation and next to no endangered species work, no consulting company wants anything to do with me. 9) Absolutely, consulting isn't something you are going to jump into except at the entry level to learn NEPA, wetland delineation, TMDL...etc 10) It also seems like once you have a PhD you're overqualfied for any consulting jobs and they consider you to have ""no experience"" 11) Plant taxonomists may be an exception here for consulting. There's a real need for them in the consulting world. 12) @11, that must be very low paying and unstable work though, right? 11) Not necessarily. If you're a botanist and can ID T&E species, you can get some well-paid positions.The ones who can are increasingly scarce and, as a whole, their population is aging. 13) Have you considered intelligence analyst positions? I've read that analyst working for a federal intelligence agency (e.g., CIA, FBI, NSA) pretty much just write and present mini dissertations on topics having to do with national security. Many agencies have some kind of science/technology analyst position. Starting pay is ~70-90k I think, and if you don't mind living in DC/NOVA, it could be a viable option. 14) management consulting if your family life can deal with travel....after 2 years with a big firm you'd probably be able to move into a permanent home-based lead/analust/management position if you have good people skills. starting pay with your experience should be around $115K. big firms include Bain, McKinsey, Boston Consulting, Deliotte (most of the big accounting firms also have consulting arms, think KPMG etc). I have never posted anything here before but have been following discussion over a few months, but I'm about a year from finishing my PhD and I just can't get excited about continuing in academia so this topic is one of great interest to me. I also agree with the thought about intelligence analyst or looking into jobs with DOE or even DOT or something like that. At AGU last year I met a scientist from DOE and he loved his job. curious to see this thread continue.","The job season is like a marathon with required sprints through mud and people that periodically throw things at you. [Please feel free to elaborate with your metaphors. It's cathartic.] OP) Okay, technically it's a simile, but whatever. 2) Job hunting is like reasoning with a toddler... 3) @2 hahaha, yeah, that doesn't bode well for me getting a job. Usually the toddler gets exactly what they want 4) job season is the meme of the dog drinking coffee in a burning room saying ""this is fine"" 5) ""Do you know what a shit rope is Julian?"" 6) @4 - the dog says everything's fine when at work, but when at his therapist's office, he sobs. 7) In the original dog comic, the dog melts in the last panel. 8) I feel like the venting page doesn't usually get this dark until the winter holidays. 9) This is like mountaineering with all the terrible things, escaping a avalanche before falling into a crevasse, escaping with a broken arm and continuing, then fighting a storm to finally find out that the food is running low. ","Why don't you have a job yet? Looking for honest self-reflection and any legitimate criticism of academic hiring in E&E here.  Still too junior; not enough pubs/outreach/etc.?  Do you think you might be applying too narrowly?  Is the field just too competitive because there are not enough positions?  Do you think that bias against minority groups is holding you back?  If you had to judge your probability of getting an academic position, what would you say it is? 1) I'm honestly worried the reason is that I didn't go to the ""right"" schools, or know the ""right"" people. I don't know what my probability is, though people keep telling me I'm a shoe-in, and I wish they'd stop. 2) Same as 1. I can't stand the shoe-in comments. Its made me not enjoy conferences because everyone I see is always surprised I don't have a job yet. 3) It's the competition, period. There are just too many extremely qualified people applying for too few jobs. We are in a field where there are maybe a dozen jobs per year across the country that we truly have a chance at/are the right fit for. With 1-300 people applying to these jobs, the numbers just don't add up. x2 4) Mom?  5)  Thanks for the responses so far. 6) I actually agree with (1) also...I went to good schools, but not the ""elite"" schools (for postdocs as well) and see less qualified people getting jobs I was a finalist for always coming from a more prestigious school (or national lab/smithsonian). All this venting is anecdotal, but I think there is something in those data points 7) Agree with 1 and 6 that pedigree matters immensly. You can't really overcome it with papers either. Invariably, when pedigree is mentioned someone will put a link to an analysis that claims it isnt important. When that happens, look at how elite schools were counted in the analysis and you will quickly realize why the analysis is flawed. 8) Having been at an Ivy for the past few years and seen quite a few job searches, it is amazing how many candidates chosen just happened to come from other Ivys. Most (all?) of those analyses only look at the final person who accepts a job, but we've had searches with 5 candidates all with a direct connection to a single department at another Ivy with close connections. In a few cases, a non-Ivy (though still 'elite' pedigree) candidate has made it to campus and actually gotten an offer, but all of the others invited were from Ivies and that wouldn't be captured in a general survey. It also really seems like they go for people with the full elite pedigree: undergrad-grad-postdoc. Its gross. 9) #1 here again, yeah, part of me is really wishing I had just taken the editor position at a Nature journal, but my PI convinced me to stay :sigh:   10)  Thanks again, all.  OP here again.  I am interested in the Ivy angle.  I feel like this is not really an issue in Canada where most U-15s (our equivalent of R1s) are generally valued equally, although one's pedigree probably still matters.  In Canada, I don't think the academic institute itself matters much, if at all. 11) @10, I'm a Canadian citizen with an ivy pedigree (grad/postdoc). Can confirm I get interviews at US R1s, but have not ever been invited to interview in Canada. They don't care. 12) what about if I'm an ivy pedigree undergrad/grad but got no R1 interviews??? 13) I feel like I don't have enough pubs, and I don't generally work in a way that produces them very quickly. All my dissertation chapters are out now, ~ 9 months post graduation, but they represented many years of diligent field work, lab work, and modeling. I don't think I can replicate that approach and have a productive post doc, so I'm actively studying my colleagues, etc to figure out a more efficient approach. 14) Pedigree definitely matters in Canada, but it's more about your supervisor than the school. If you trained with one of the handful of kingmakers in Canada, you're set. 15) @14 I don't believe that. I was in such a lab, have more than 50 very good publicaitons and have not been hired in Canada though keep trying. Some from my lab group were hired, some were not. Names do not guarantee anythign at all... and can work against you if they have generated jealousy?"
"Top 10 NON-nondouchebag Comments In response to the ""Top 10 Douchebag Comments"" post below (hilarious! btw), I've decided to enumerate the most non-douchebag (i.e., nice, pleasant, amiable, encouraging, positive) type posts on here. Hell, even peachy and dandy comments count. Add your own as they occur to you.  I'll start:
1) ""Screw it, THEY lost out."" HERE'S ONE FOR ALL THE REJECTS! *slams back 4th shot of Sauza*
2) Oh, thought it was that Christian Pickle! Now, there is something I would study. 
3) sounds like my first teaching position except the pay wasn't good, the start up was lousy and the teaching load was oppressive. I had to get a grant with 1/4 release to get down to a 4/4. However, in that school a few faculty were very good and I still admire them very much. Its amazing how many terrible places there are, and how one person's hell can can be another person's heaven. I hop you posted your experience on the Universities to fear page of the wiki! :) 
4) ""Who deleted my beaver?"" (4.5) My favorite comment!!!
5) Those of you who posted nasty comments here - please remove them! This cell is for the opposite type of postings, comments like: ""That you got an interview means that you were good enough to get the job"". 
(6) ""Very refreshing and excellent advice, I think that's what we're supposed to be about here. Thank you."" From the 3/1 post on the Discussion page.
7) ""...all of us feel A LOT of pressure to try and make the cut and I think it's showing far too much on this wiki. The competition is FIERCE and we seem to be turning on each other as a result. Can't we all just get along? Evaluate your weaknesses, do your best to strengthen them, and keep plugging. That's all we can do.""","Universities to LOVE and FEAR Share your experience with others on the new Ecology- Universities to LOVE and Universities to FEAR sheets Be sure to fear any place that turned you down! 2) That's a stupid idea #1. First, if we all did that the ""Universities to FEAR"" spreadsheet would be flooded in hours. Second, being rejected is no reason to ""fear"" a university. 3) Put well, #2. (3) Clearly, sarcasm from #1 perhaps? (4) After seeing some of the comments on the wiki, I don't think we should assume 1 is being sarcastic. Sad, but true. 4) #1 here...I WAS being sarcastic, after reading the crap posted on the FEAR page I thought it would be obvious.

It was probably an inside hire from the start. 1) Nope 4) The inside candidate always gets the job...unless its me 1) No, no hint of an inside candidate.... 5) Not true about inside candidates. I know I have bumped inside candidates out of searches, so don't be dissuaded by the possibility of an internal candidate. I have also seen internal candidates at SLACs get interviewed but then not offered. Shit happens. 6) Wait, shit happens? Ah, nuts. 7) Just lost out to an inside candidate even though my interview went fabulously. :(","Hiring process 1) What is everyone's opinion on leaving a postdoc for a VAP? 2) I did that and needed it badly at the time. I don't regret it. I only had taught one course on my own before my postdoc, and my postdoc was research-intensive (e.g., >3 pubs/year and at least 1 grant/year, no teaching allowed/encouraged and very little research mentoring). I got burned out because I love teaching and training students, so I started looking at what made my peers successful in getting SLAC-type jobs. Thus, I took teaching gig at a *good* SLAC (that, to me, has been very important because the reputation goes a long way on the job market). It has paid off. Had many campus interviews this year and 3 job offers. I also mentored undergrads in research while here, and that went over very well in the job search.  3) Just make sure you have several publications before you go- even SLACs want profs w' publications, even if there is no research $ or lab space for the professors. If you have several postdocs under your bet, a VAP can give you the teaching experience you don't already have.  However, if that experience is a bomb, it will hurt you.  So, it still depends.

I know that having a secure job is good.

We all are!  https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2016/dec/02/short-term-contracts-university-academia-family","How do you ID search w/ inside candidate?  How do you ID list of candidates in general? 1) I've seen a number of comments on here that mention competiting with an inside candidate... curious how folks learn about this?  I've had 5 on-campus interviews this year, and was only able to identify the other candidates for one of the searches (they posted the names/titles on the dept seminar page).  How do you guys learn this information?  Any tips for figuring out the list of other candidates? 3) you can snoop around on their website and see if someone is already doing what is advertised. A great source of info that has given it away both times on an interview for me was the graduate student meeting. 4) Grad students are great in this regards and often spill the beans. In my case, when I asked the committee how many people they were interviewing they said 4, but the students said that there were 5 candidates including an inside candidate. 5) Department webpages are good, but searching outside the official webpages can also be helpful. 6) Why do you care? This issue comes up all the time - inside candidates don't always get the offer. I've seen it go either way. 6) Internal candidate here - my chair told me in my department they've never hired an internal candidate for a TT job, so it can absolutely go either way. Here's hoping I'm the first! 7) Fingers crossed! 8) People always say it could go either way, but in my limited sample size (4) it has been 100% for the internal candidate getting the job. 9) #6 here. We have 3 TT faculty searches happening now, with internal candidates on all. Will update with success rate of internal candidates to add to #8 sample size.  10) #1 here - thanks #6, that would be great if you could update here w/ those results.  If you're at the the University I suspect you're from, then I'm a candidate for one of those positions too.  Best of luck to both of us!  :) 11) What will you do with this information? 12) Complain that someone took a shitty adjunct position at a university and was rewarded for the effort. Seriously though, it's not that difficult to become an internal candidate. There are adjunct positions available all over the country. If you think internals have a guaranteed green light to a tenure-track position, take an adjunct job and wait. But I must say, while #8 has observed 4 our of 4 searches with internals go the way of the internal, I have seen 5 out of 5 go the opposite route. Good luck! Oh, and by the way, internal candidates that get overlooked for a person with a comparable CV get just as mad as externals that get overlooked with a comparable CV.  13) Anecdata here, but I'm a former internal candidate that didn't get the offer- they wanted someone 'more different' from my supervisor, which I guess is fair, but damnit, it sucked. (and I dare say it sucked worse for me than it would have for an external not hired person because it was so personal). Found a new postdoc soon after. 14) I agree with #12. I am rooting for the internal candidate who took a shitty adjunct job to get the tenure track position in the same department when it becomes available. x2 15) You wouldn't believe the horror stories I have about internal candidates. I heard an SC member at my university actually say he was volunteering for the search committee to assure the internal didn't get hired. I witnessed a search committee purposely not tell the internal that he wasn't on the campus invite list to keep him on the line in case the others fell through. Of course, he found out and was furious. The pathway for internals is just as bad as externals, but for some reason, the internals always come out to be the enemies. They aren't the enemies; they are just people looking for jobs. Most are in the exact same boat but had to take an adjunct job b/c of a spousal hire, loss of post-doc, etc... x4 16) That's why I wonder why people care how successful inside candidates are, so much that they'll collect 'data' on it.  17) Why are you so upset that people are interested in real ""data"" versus anon anectdotal evidence from the internet?  Why does this bother you so much?  Seems somewhat anti-science.  :)  18) Haha. I was poking fun at the tone - as if that data would bring about a 'change' that would benefit everyone. IME I've won against an internanal candidate once and then lost against one. I've lost against external candidates too. It really doesn't matter. 19) There are too many variables for the data to be meaningful. It would only be meaningful if you could account for every variable; e.g., publication number, years in post-doc, grant #, grant $s, $s per grant, grants per year, book chapter #, gender, race, age, etc...... All candidates are inherently different. So although the data (internal vs. external hire) are ""real,"" they aren't meaningful without 100s of covariates. 18) I have an interview coming up for a full Prof/chair position in Australia, so I've been reading the bios and publications lists of the school's current faculty to get an idea of who I'd be working with if I got the job and who might be on the interview panel. There's one current faculty member who is an Assoc Prof currently, and would be a better fit for the role than me. If he isn't on the interview panel, I'll take it as given that he's the inside candidate, which would make me the diversity candidate with no real chance. 19) #18, not true at all. Just remember, there's always a ratio of people who like a particular colleague and people who don't. Maybe it's a fairly divided department and the dean wants somebody external to not create a ripple. You never know. 20) #6 here - all three searches with internal candidates went to external candidates. I say this not to give real data, but to point out to folks that there is really no reasons to worry about internal vs external candidates - you are in competition with everyone regardless! I find myself descending into a sadness spiral when thinking about who I'm up against so....I mostly just don't.  ","When you see VAP positions you'd be super jazzed about... if you were single. But you respect your spouses' career/life too much to have them move somewhere new for a year... 2) Yes, the 1 year VAPs basically rule out people with kids too, yet they seem to be the best way to end up getting a job at a SLAC if you don't have enough teaching experience. Super frustrating. 3) On the flip side, us single folk get the pleasure of trying to date in whatever weird-ass town our portability allows us to end up in. x3! 4) Yea, basically VAP positions are crappy for everyone","Not being fully reimbursed after interview!?! I just completed an interview at a Southern R2 and wasn't reimbursed for the full cost of my trip (flight, taxi, parking = $1300). I was only reimbursed for 1K of it. Originally, they told me that flights should not be > 800, but when I let them know that it wasn't possible (small airport to small airport), I received an email confirmation that it was ok and I should go ahead and purchase the $1200 flight. Then when I was interviewing, they said that they would cover parking from my home airport ($40) and the taxi from the hotel to the airport ($50). However, I received the cheque in the mail yesterday with a form that detailed I would only be reimbursed for 1000 of it. I understand if some Universities have small budgets, but I feel that they should have been more clear to me. I also think it is down right shitty to ask a postdoc to pay for 300 of their interview. It doesn't help that I turned down the offer they gave me and the reimbursement was signed after I turned them down. Has anyone faced this and what do you do? 2) That sucks.  Write the chair of the search committee and department chair and let them know this needs to be fixed.  Otherwise, name & shame.  3)  Go above the department level to the Dean and also their HR folks. 4) Same happened to me at a PhD interview at an institution where I declined! Talk directly to the SC, he/she may be unaware what's going on in the finance office. 5) that's ridiculous... not only is small airport to small airport expensive, a lot of these interviews are only on a couple of weeks notice and plane tickets can be particularly expensive then... and oh so much worse that they weren't straightforward   6) That is almost certainly an admin applying a cap to the reimbursement. It would take special paperwork to get past it, that I bet someone didn't file.   It could be a dick move, but more likely someone was just incompetent or lazy.  Def write the search chair and dept head.   Try to be polite, but reference your previous conversation.   Reasonable people don't expect pdocs to cough up that kind of money on a whim. 7) My institution tried to do that once. It was at the chair level. We found out on the search committee (don't remember how) and called human resources. Problem was fixed. I'm willing to bet that this is against human resource's policy and it's just a chair trying to protect his/her budget without anybody knowing. I'd call the search committee chair on the phone and if not resolved in a few days, I'd call human resources. 8) Thanks everyone! (number 1 here). The reimbursement document was signed by the chair of the SC, Department Head, and the Surpervising Vice Pres. I will email all and hope that it can be fixed. 9) LOL. Not to be mean here but they have $$ to pay three people (including the VP) to sign a single document but no $$ to reinburse a postdoc which THEY invited for an interview....I am glad you are not accepting the position. 10) Was their a larger airport within reasonable distance you could fly out of?  I was about ~2 hrs from a more ""major"" airport while living in a small university town.  I would never have expected a university to fly me directly out of my town, but would expect to drive.  I am wondering if maybe they did not expect you to fly small airport to small airport?  Regardless, if they approved this, they should have paid.  Non-payment after is unacceptable. 11) Not everyone has a car... ","Yesterday I found out that a friend/collaborator of mine was denied tenure (R1).  This person is a fantastic scientist, and published lots of great papers as a P.I. , and I know from many of their trainees that this person is also an amazing mentor. They couldn't get a major federal grant, and that's supposedly why the tenure was denied.  As a person on the job market for a TT position, seeing episodes like this makes me pretty nervous and makes the perspective of the whole thing pretty scary. 2) This very scenario is why R1s aren't my top choice 3) Tenure denial is unusual at most R1's that aren't like Harvard, so don't write them all off. 4) OP here. It wasnt' Harvard, and it wasn't Ivy league.  But still of the top 10. 5) Here are some data on tenure rates at various institutions, including both R1s and non-R1s: https://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2014/07/21/dont-worry-too-much-about-whether-youll-get-tenure-because-you-probably-will/ 6) Most R1 interviews I went to told me that they have changed their thoughts given the federal funding situation - they want you to show evidence that you tried to get a big federal grant, but won't deny tenure if you've done a good job at that but haven't actually gotten a grant, especially if your publications/teaching/mentoring are good. 7) how do you provide evidence that you tried to get a big federal grant? Do you send the rejection notice or submit your rejected proposals as part of your tenure package? serious question. 8) Do you not have a grants office at your institution? When I was in grad school even the DDIG had to be registered and vetted by the Grants staff, and I wasn't even at that good of a research school. 9) @7 At my R1, we need to include a list of all proposals funded and unfunded as part of our promotion & tenure packages (and annual reviews).","One-year positions Hey, where'd this thread go?","Its very frustrating, when there are international calls with international selection committees and already at the interview stage mostly internal candidates are invited. 2) Or you apply to an international call, get flown overseas for interview, and still they hire the internal candidate (who didn't have to interview under jetlag)...3) Just turn those international visits into a mini-vacation. I usually go 2-3 days early to get over jetlag and see some sights! 4) @2 yeah, don't know if it is better to be invited in this case or not ... hope you could get sth. out of it at least (training-wise). 5) interviewing under international jet lag is brutal and I sure hope it's taken into account.... 6) @2 woah! I have an international interview coming up and I'm really hoping I won't be in the same boat!","Asking for extension- Postdocs I recently got an offer for a postdoc, but had an interview today for another position. The problem is that the other position will not make their decision until Friday, whereas the place that offered me requested my decision on Thursday (they gave me a week to decide). So, is it appropriate to ask for an extension on my decision? I feel slimy/bad about it, and like asking for an extension is playing my hand, and may set our relationship off on the wrong foot if I were to accept. I have some faculty members I've discussed this with and opions seem varied- some folks say it's part of the job hiring process and everyone should understand it's not personal, whereas some are adamant that asking for an extension, after giving a week, is not a good look. Any advice is appreciated. 2) It's absolutely fair to ask-- especially since you're only requesting ~24 hours extra time. 3) It's reasonable. Anyone who doesn't think that it is reasonable is probably not someone you want to work with. 2x"
"Top 10 Douchebag Comments In response to the poster from yesterdays thoughts, I've decided to do enumerate the most douchebag type posts that you can think of (it doesn't really have to be 10, add you own as they occur to you) I'll start:
1) If you haven't been hired yet, it's because you're a loser
2) Posting and reading this wiki is a waste of time (extra points for irony)
3) Poor me, I'm a man/woman and I can't get a job because of all those wimmins/mins 
4) Referring to people have been out awhile as ""fruit rotting on the vine"" 
-Oh yeah, I loved (said with dripping sarcasm) that quote. Such naivete, not to mention arrogance
5) ""Blah , blah, blah, Maybe men just respond more often, or maybe women are smarter, and don't waste their time with this kind of stuff..""
6) My rejection letter didn't make me feel good about myself.
7) But I feel like rejecting all 3 candidates that this really reflects poorly on them.
8) ""The other [candidate] was a dead fish.""
9) The sc made me pay for my dinner.
10)""Instead of settling for a poor teacher with decent research (that happened with the last hire...regrets!)...""","Letter of offer Just wondering how specific a letter of offer should be, in regards to the negotiations that have taken place. The letter I just received basically says ""We are pleased to offer you this position, "" outlines amounts for salary, startup, and moving expenses, describes teaching responsibilities for the first year only, and gives the start date. There are other issues that we discussed during negotiations (e.g., space/equipment, adjunct position for spouse, teaching in future years) that are not mentioned at all. Is this typical? What should definitely be in here, versus in a contract later on? Thanks! 1) Everything should be in the letter- esp. stuff that they may ""develop"" or ""work on"" later. I'd have a specific line for start-up, including when this can be spent; space, including room number and any residual equipment. (2) BE SPECIFIC, GET EVERYTHING IN WRITING, EVERYTHING. (3) I have a close friend who was promised a lot by the dean during the negotiations. Unfortunately, some of the details of what they agreed to were not in the contract and so the dean reneged when my friend brought it up with him after she was hired. Live and learn.",NA,NA,NA,"I was wondering about how one might best assess the financial health of the college? I remember using a website that helped determine how solvent the insitution is but I can't seem to remember what it was. Any thoughts on this would be very helpful. I am interviewing at some SLACs and this information seems potentially important. 1) Ask them during the dinner conversation.  You'll get an answer of some kind. 2) the website you are probably thinking of is http://www.forbes.com/sites/schifrin/2013/07/24/is-your-college-going-broke/2/ 3) OP here thanks! That is not the website that I was thinking of but it is really helpful! I am wondering how important to factor in financial health of the institution when considering an offer. 4) you can also go to http://www.thesustainableuniversity.com.  It is great for scoping things out. Often times, just get a look at the faculty salaries and when the last raise came.  Also, what are the faculty driving, how does the dean/chair dress.  believe it or not, these things correlate sometimes! 5) Thanks #4! That is the one I was thinking of. Interesting note about what to look for. I must admit that for my dream job interview I had last year (at an R1 that I failed to get) the faculty was well-paid and I was picked up in a beater 1990s toyota.  Also, some of my concern isn't pay but also resources for teaching/research. I am applying to SLACs mainly. 6) The US News and World Report website lists the school's endowment, which for SLACs can be pretty informative about the resources available to faculty for teaching/research. 6) Try this: http://www.thesustainableuniversity.com/ [just saw that it had been suggested already - take it as an endorsement!] 7) Here's the one that I've used: http://chronicle.com/article/College/140495/  I think this is an important consideration, maybe not for your pre-tenure years, but you want to make sure your institution won't be in a crises in 10, 20, or 30 years. 8) #5, almost always salary, resources, and general working environment are strongly correlated. It just is.  Everywhere I have been has followed this pattern for good or bad.  9) #7, you have to think about this as you say, of course today so many schools are already in crisis, you have to ask how many will even exist 20-30 years from now, especially when you consider small liberal arts colleges and under-sized state universities. 10) I think comparing the Endowment/Enrollment ratio amongst the schools you're thinking of as a rough estimate of financial health. 11) What is considered a ""healthy"" endowment/enrollment ratio? 11) the sustainable university site can be a bit misleading, as many well endowed state universities have had to work in the red over the past 5 years or so as they reconfigure the way they operate in light of large cuts in state support, and/or they have undergone a large building campaign recently (which may have started pre-2008 and continued through the economic downturn--this could apply to any school). I echo the advice to look at endowments, and how much they have/student, and so on. I seriously doubt Dartmouth, Yale etc are on the road to financial collapse, even though they show up in the highest risk category. 12) #11, no you cannot take this list by itself and you must consider it within context.  If they endowment they show is high and the school is spending unsustainably, it may be ok.  However, if it has no endowment and spending out the butt, what do you think is going to happen?  Also, you need to combine this small peice of information with that on Chronicle and elsewhere.  Together you can determine the big picture instead of jumping to conclusions.  I can tell you that two schools where I taught are in the high risk category, and believe me when I tell you they should be.  At least among the schools with which I am very familiar, the numbers are very accurate and the catagory placement well justified. 13) #11 -- I will remember that when I get the offer at Yale...In seriousness, I think these numbers can really helpful when looking at not-so big and not as well known schools. Also, even at the big schools it can indicate a decline from current resources (I know profs at UC schools have seen their resources decline quite a bit).

","Don't you just love/hate it when you get a rejection letter on Christmas Eve? True Story. 2) I got a rejection after an on-campus interview first thing in 2015 when I went to write some Happy New Year emails. True Story. 3) Sorry to hear that 1+2. Extremely poor form on someone's part. 4) Poor form? You expect the office staff of the department to estimate how quickly each rejection letter will take to deliver to each candidate?  5) who sends rejections via snail mail?  these are email rejections being sent and received on holidays. 2 again) I don't blame the SC because they simply sent the email out as soon as they had the signed contract from the candidate who received the offer. I prefer that I knew earlier even if it was on a holiday rather than finding out a few days later. 6) I never had that happen but would prefer that they hold off (or maybe I shouldn't check emails on those days!). When I received rejection letters, I usually already knew the result. However, even then it still stings a little. Would rather not think about for a day or two.","How much postdoc is too much postdoc? I was wondering about teaching loads for those with a teaching position or those that have been offered/interviewed. I interviewed with a MS-only university and the teaching load is 4/4 with all 3 credit courses. Both my postdoc advisor and the director of our lab thought this was crazy. Looking through the Negotiations page, it seems like 2/2 is fairly common for a MS only. Is there a good source for this kind of info across schools? 
2) One SLAC: 21 hours TT/tenured, 24 hours visiting. I taught five courses over three terms, and the TT/tenured faculty taught four. Another SLAC: 24 hours for everyone. I teach 4 courses over two semesters with three lab sections each semester. You would assume MS places would be similar or less... 
3) I have interviewed at several SLACs this year, and the teaching load is usually a 3-3. That 3 typically means 1 lecture with 2 lab sections or 1 lec+lab and 1 lec. At MS institutions, this has been broken down by credits (e.g., 12-12, where 1 credit = 1 h class time). So, you could be teaching 4 lectures a term (NUTS!... and unlikely), or 1 lecture + 2 lab sections for that lecture + 1 other lecture. In my experiences, MS-level institutions have the highest teaching loads by about 1 course/term. So, yes, that is a high teaching load. But you should also ask if that teaching load is dependent on research productivity. For instance, if you publish with students, you may be rewarded with a release of 1 course (=3 credits). Also, enrollment in the course may determine how much ""credit"" you get for teaching it. All questions that are worth asking if you get the offer. 
4) #2 again. Ah, yes, I forgot MS places are trying to do all the things! Thus, you have high teaching loads AND moderately high research expectations.  
5) I've interviewed at SLACs where the teaching load is 2/2, and where it is 5/4.  I've interviewed at MS schools where it is 2/2 and where it is 5/5.  To me, it seems MS schools offer more opportunities for research buyouts, while at SLACs research buyouts are more limited.  BUT, I think everything depends on the institution itself. 
6) OP here, thanks all for the information! Helpful to get more info.  
2) Some people can handle it, most end up abandoning any kind of research under that load.  I've done 18 sh.  It sucks.  The big thing you have to evaluate here is do you need a job more than you need a future in research.  When I graduated, i would have been better to bypass such a position, but did not.  Today, I would be better accepting it if offered.  So, things are really relative.  However, if your teaching experience is sufficiently lacking that you need to ask this quesiton, I would think REALLY HARD about the repercussions to your future.  It may be the best opportunity you will ever get, or it may be the worst decision you ever made.  Make your decision based on the best available info and pray you get it right.  The job market sucks, so consider that too. 
7) I'm a VAP at an MS-level uni and my load is typically 6 2-labs + 1 3-hour lab or 5 sections of lecture and 2 3-hour lab sections, so 15 contact hours total.  8) I'm fairly naïve I guess, but I don't know what a 5/4 is. That can't be 5 courses in one semester (can it???) . And it can't be 5 credits (could it?). Seems like the confusion is about how to give credit for labs....where I am a VAP (a private MS school), they measure in contact hours. Faculty with ""active"" research programs teach 15 contact hours per year, otherwise it's 18 contact hours, with a lab counting for 3 contact hours. So a 3 hour lecture and 2 lab sections is 9 contact hours, resulting in a load of 6 hours (typically a 3 hour lecture and a 3 hour seminar) the other semester. 
9) To #8, #5 again.  Yes, 5/4 means classes 5 classes one semester, 4 classes the next semester.  The places I've seen with this teaching load usually expect 2 lectures + 3 labs or 3 lectures + 2 labs.  None of them expects research to be done with those teaching loads.  Also, such schools are popularly known as ""teaching dungeons"" by people who like doing research. 10) to #9: 2 lec/3 labs is not that excessive, and is not incompatible with an active research program, at least after the first couple of years of heavy prepping. I was at an MS-level state school and 2 lec/2-3 labs was standard, yet more than half the faculty were doing active research -- averaging > 1 paper/yr easily, some doing way more. They certainly did expect us to do research, although the bar was admittedly quite low.  If, however, you mean 2 lec-only courses + 3 lec+lab courses, then that's a different kettle of fish! 11) to #10 & #9.  #10 is making a generality that is not a good one.  It depends on your research area.  If you are a field ecologist dong research that is time-intensive, you will have difficulty.  If you're a laboratory scientist that requires time to complete processes, you will also have difficulty.  I personally think people who do histoanatomy could fit it in their research under pretty heavy teachng loads.  The problem is, histo equipment is often not present.  Those who do microbio MIGHT be able to do it effectively.  Any approach that requires little time, space and facilities will be fine.  Anything else will almost always require collaboration, and eventually decay.  The big thing is the time required to stay up-to-date if you are multi-disciplinary.  Its hard enough staying moderately up-to-date in one field, let alone 2-3.  I know peopple who do it, they are exceptionally dedicated to their research and teaching.  Most just plain cannot. 10 again) Well, the active people in the dept I mentioned ranged pretty widely in research areas, mostly field based, and all had lives.  So I maintain that it's an exaggeration to say 2/2-3 is incompatible with research.  It just limits how much you can do.\ 12) I am not sure what is encompassed by different people's ideas of ""active"" or ""compatible with research"". For what I do, and I contend this holds for the vast majority of E&E people, there is absolutely no way you could teach 2 lectures and 3 labs each semester while maintaining an active research program unless you give up on eating and sleeping. It just does not work. Add a family of any type to that and the math is just worse. So the people who say this works either have a different definition of research-active, are doing very unusual research, are teaching classes in some high throughput/scantron/whatever fashion, or they are superhuman.  10 again) yeah, not really. 2 lec + 3 labs = 15 hrs contact time per week, so maybe 25 hrs total after you've taught the courses a couple of times so the prep is minimal. That leaves 15-35 hrs to do whatever else, plus 2-3 mo/yr in the summer. I've known a large number of EE types doing hardcore fieldwork-based research with that kind of teaching load, and still having a family, etc. It's not that hard. If your definition of ""research active"" means ""publishing 5-10 papers per year like I did in my R1 postdoc under Dr Superstar"", then yes, that's a long bow to draw.  But if it means getting at least 1-2 papers out and keeping your hand in it, then there's really no problem.  12) What percent are actually active, and what constitutes active? You sure as sure are not getting 2 papers a year in any journal above subdiscipline journals? 13) It's fairly easy to do research with 12 contact hours a semester. Here's my advice: 1. Jam all your courses in the morning or in a 2-3 day block; 2. Grade at home while drinking beer; 3. Be good at having your students do work. Seriously peeps, if you follow this protocol, you will have 2 or 3 days off a week or no course obligations after 11:00am (except maybe one day a week), you will never have to walk into the lab except to say ""where are we at today,"" and your students' test scores will either get progressively better or progressively worse depending on you demeanor when drunk. Win, Win, and Win. And oh yeah, within the next ten years, most schools that are not R1 will have 12 contact hour teaching loads. It's the wave of the future. More with less. #9 again) I used to think like #10, and then I got a VAP job; my first time putting in a class. Each one hour that I am in the classroom translates to 6 hours of prep outside. And I've heard the same from R1 profs. Now, it should get easier the second time around, but unless you are mailing it in, you can't have a meaninful research career with 2 lectures and 3 labs per week. That's 15 hours of in-class time, even if there is no prep or set up. Add in committees, office hours, grading etc. and you've filled 50 hours right there. You might have a small boutique research line that gets some internal funding, but you won't be competitive for external research awards. 14) Absolutely not true. People teaching 12 contacts land external funding via RUI from NSF all the time. Typically, when landed, quarter time release is provided by the university to ease the teaching load during the life of the grant. #9, in my opinion, you are drastically over-estimating the time required for teaching after you get your courses in order. I find it funny how people think that 6 hours extra a week in class and maybe an extra 4-6 hours a week in course prep will drastically change their research output. I got half time release last semester (12 to 6 contacts) and it didn't change my research output/impact one bit. Why? When you are at a SLAC or M/L, your students do your work. All the release did was give me more time to stand over their shoulders. There's a big difference between being a grad student, post-doc, and faculty member. When you become a faculty member, you become more of a manager. If you are good at managing and attracting students, you will be active no matter where you end up. (10 again): I agree with 14, obviously.  to #9: I ""think like this"" because I actually did it for five years as an Asst Prof. I got an NSF grant and published a reasonable amount in decent journals. You are right that 6 hrs of prep (or even more) outside class might be necessary *the first time* you teach a course, but if you're still that inefficient after 2-3 rounds, you should rethink your approach.  Also, if you're doing 3 repeats of the same lab, the prep time is little or no more than for one lab, so it's more like 18 hrs total prep the first time around.  15) to 14.  Well, I had half a million $$ in my first year under an 18 contact hour load.  I know what I did, I know how I managed it, and I know how much effort it took.  Can someone do it for 5 years?  sure!  Can they continue it for 30?  Well, I've done the research, either they can't or they don't.  Approximately 1 in 300 faculty continue that sort of high productivity.  In my prime I could crank out 20 papers a year in journals with impact ratings between 0.5 to 1.5.  Today, those same journals range from 0.9 to 2.  That was under 15 contact hours.  Of course, what it does not say is that I was also doing all the administration for the department, 100% of the advising, running two student clubs, serving on the faculty senate and about 15 other committees, and serving as the editor of a journal.  YOU might have been able to do it.  That says more about YOU than it does about anything else.  It sounds like you are an ultra-talented individual.  A few years ago I did a survey of ecologists on expectations for publication at different contact levels.  The OVERWHELMING consensus was that under a 12 hr contact scenario, a person should expect to publish around 2 solid pubs (not counting notes and editorials) every 5 years.  When I was under 18, it was hard to get out those proposals, and because of the time commitment to teaching and service, it cut into personal life at home.  believe me, your spouse will eventually get fed up with you working from dawn to dusk.  In any case, as I did say, SOME can, but that is not all.  Speaking of what others can do based on what you have done is a very poor strategy for advising others, especially if you are exceptional.  Also there is the perception problem when you apply for grants.  Geting an NSF grant in your first 5 years is not a big accomplishment, even under heavy teaching loads.  maintaining consistently funded series of NSF grants is.  I'm not talking about RUIs or equipment grants either.  If you are at an undergrad institution in an EPScoR state, those are virtually give-mes.  A few years back, I applied to the Dept of Energy, and made it to the last cut.  The evals said, and I quote, ""the project is well thought out and fundable, and the investigator is well-qualified, however, the institution lacks the capacity to support any research.""  I had a perfect score in every area Except institutional capacity.  Why?  because a school with those kinds of teaching loads lacks tons of other resources.  if they did not, they would not be skimping on faculty resources. 16) And to you 14, it sounds like you were in a situation that is highly atypical. So, don't base your advice on your own experiences. I am pretty confident that the average SLAC and M/L hire is not serving as the only administrator to his/her department, teaching 18 contacts, and all the other stuff you said you did. Again, if you want to do research, you will find time to do research, just like you. 17) I will also add that all (for the benefit of OP) that the balance you want is critically important, as well as what the university wants.  Some universities see research as a distraction from teaching, and will not actively support research.  If you want to teach 5 classes per semester, and you never want to write grants or publish again, there is a university for you.  If you want to teach 1-2 classes per semester and keep an active lab, there is also a university for you. 18) yes sure but you might not get a job at the type of university you want  18) to you 16, don't try to sugar coat reality. I did not post my CV on here, I have been in plenty of different universities and colleges and in scenarios running from virtually no teaching to an absurd amount.  Look, if you want to be over-worked, go for it.  When you are 60 and seeing a counselor, or when you look up and your conteporaries with equal productivity are making 20K more than you, just drop your head and tell yourself you were an idiot to marry the first girl/guy you dated. You have been warned. 19) Uh oh, a warning. Don't take a job with 18 contact hours, 100% administrative duties, 100% advising duties, a crap ton of required service, etc... I'm pretty sure you don't have to warn me about that. So, I guess you were the idiot that married the first girl/guy you dated?   20) To #19.  No, I did not have the advantage of experience or advice in that respect. Further, at small schools, sometimes things get dumped on you by admin and you are stuck with it like it or not.  I did not have the priviledge of an honest person warning me of what to look for, I also did not have the piles of online resources available to me that now exist and allow you to check on a schools financial situation, enrollment trends, and faculty resources.  But hey, ""I've done seen the promised land, and I'ld rather starve all at once!"" as was said in the Grapes of Wrath.  You want to learn the hard way, fine.  You want to work twice as hard as you need too?  Fine.  But do not run around telling others its all rosey, when I know that you would never have left if you liked working in those conditions.  I also know you were darn lucky to get out when you did.  Soooooo, grow up and quit filling people full of garbage that is largely wrong. 21) No clue what you are talking about 20. I never left. I love my job. I look for new jobs every year only for location advantages. 22) I taught 2 years at a SLAC; during this time I taught 11 different classes in 2 years; I had 2 repeats second year = 13 classes total. On top of this, I also taught 2-3 accompanying labs each week. = Absolutely no time; up till 3am every night, even weekends.  On the other hand, I taught 3 years at a medium LAC.  There I taught 4 sections of the same lab and one non-majors lecture most semesters. VERY different experiences. 23) to 21, well, I guess you can add that to the piles of things about academia you don't know, or like to spout off about. ",I'm fairly sure that they're not really even allowed to ask that,"# applied how do you know how many people applied? or are people who use this document just adding to the numbers? how is this useful? 2) users add one to the number in the cell when they've applied. can be useful. 3) It just tells you how many people using this site applied, which is useful for knowing how many other people may have information on the progress of the job search. 4) I suspect there are a lot of people like me that don't go through and add to this number but still update the site when we receive info","I know i should be flattered, but asking me to reapply to your failed search that I interviewed for last year really just comes off as a major 'fuck you'.  2) Eh, don't take it personally. They likely sent out some form of relatively generic email to everyone. I got a similar email recently to a school I didnt even make the short list for. 3) I actually got my dream job when I re-applied for a job that I didn't even get long-listed for 6 months prior.  The search failed, I re-applied with a better written research statement, etc. and now have the job. I guess I can see how it could seem like as an FU to some, but to me it would seem like an fortunate opportunity to try to put together a tighter package 4) I think the OP's point is that they not only already applied, but were short-listed and intreviewed, so could have been offered the job when the first choice declined rather than being asked to apply again. It's a slightly different situation than when you re-apply for a job that you were never short-listed for. 5) I saw the same person interview for the same job 3 years apart (took a while for it to be re-advertised). I also saw the same person interview for a different job a a few years apart, the first time they were deemed non-competitive, the second time they had offers from everywhere. There are many reasons why searches fail, and those reasons do not always reflect badly on the candidates not offered.  If you were encouraged to re-apply, then reapply. In the passing year, hopefully your CV has improved and you are more competitive. To interpret this as a FU is to let your ego intrude and to misunderstand the nature of a search... the search is not about you.  1 again) If everyone at that school didn't know I scored another TT job elsewhere, I'd agree with 5.  6) I had same expereince as 3.","Rochester (from Faculty Jobs page) What's happening at this school? They can't keep faculty through tenure. Seems hostile to junior faculty. (2) Have many people left before tenure? Is it just this department? 3) Dear OP, these comments are unwelcome unless you are trying to discourage people from applying to this position. 4) The department is not hostile to junior faculty. On the contrary, I’ve found it to be quite supportive. JB . 5) As a current Asst Prof in this department, I can say that this place is incredibly supportive of its young faculty. AML 6) OP here- Then that's good. Glad to have your perspective. I don't know the department and was legitimately asking as an outsider who has only seen several recent job ads and several faculty leave. You'll notice this kind of question is not uncommon on this forum. 7) Perhaps suggesting that an amazing department (my perspective albeit as an outsider) is ""hostile to junior faculty"" based on basically no evidence is unfair and reckless--this is how BS rumors get started. OP says this question is not uncommon on this forum. I suggest that those posting it think twice before asking, and consider the consequences (especially if they are thinking of using phrasing as absurd as that used by the OP here). (x4) 8) If a university or department is losing faculty, it might be good to pay attention during an interview and think of non-science reaons, such as if you'd fit in culturally to a fairly conservative part of NY. I doubt there are really bad and evil people there, but if people leave, there are usually many reasons. Fitting in and general happiness are among those why people may want to leave. 9) It is a great program! I hear candidates have been invited. 10) This doesn't take away from the general point #8 was making, but Rochester is definitely -not- culturally conservative. For one cherry-picked reference, it is the 38th most liberal city in the US in this study: https://alt.coxnewsweb.com/statesman/metro/081205libs.pdf 11) It's certainly not Alabama, but it's in the Rust Belt and isn't likely to get any more liberal than it is. Trump barely lost that part of New York. 12) Dunno why this University is singled out for being in a fairly conservative city. Lots of positions here that are in less desirable places yet Rochester gets singled out... 13) I'm not sure why it was brought up, but having known several faculty and postdocs who spent some time there and left after being unhappy, maybe there is something about the place that makes people unwelcome or unhappy, generally. (x2) You can be in a less desirable place in the country but be happy if the department is happy. Or also be unhappy in a desirable place but in an unhappy department. 14) I'm going to take out some bitterness by ranting about various aspects of institutions that rankle me in some way (i.e. every single one listed here). It's gonna take a while, but I look forward to more conversations like these. 15) I share #14's sentiment but will devote my time to ranting about institutions located in towns not liberal enough for my taste (i.e. every single one listed here). 16) I'm curious why the postdocs/faculty were uhappy w the dept. Has anyone gone through the school who knows what the issues are? 16) this thread summarizes some of the issues I've heard about from others, but I doubt anyone wants to post their personal experiences  17)  Since it appears as though at least one or two currenty faculty in that department have already responded to the OP, perhaps they can tell us why the turn over appears to be higher than normal?  18)....or maybe not, thanks so much for the insight #5 and #4, you've really helped make this clearer for the OP.  Clown shoes","Major advice: If negotiating and deciding whether or not to defer one semester: Ask to see what your payslip from HR would say for initial paycheck. I deferred to start mid-academic term (Spring semester). My pay for Jan-Aug 25th (when fall starts, and thus the new academic year starts) is half my salary being paid over 8 months. This is because my position is for an academic term of 9 months and I am here for half the term (spring semester only). Normally the fall+spring 9 month salary would be paid out over 12 months and cover the next summer. By starting mid-academic year, this results in the first calendar year earning 5/6 of my salary instead of 100%. Baiscally 1/2 my salary for 8 months plus 4 months of earning 1/12 of my salary: 1/2 + 1/3 = 5/6 salary for 2018 calendar year. Upon discovering this, I asked my Department Head about it and she suggested to always ask what your pay slip will be. 2) Curious how the pay language was phrased in your contract, seems weird that they could get away with this. 3) OP, signed for the academic term, salary for 9months (two semesters). It's because fall is paid out over the following summer (fall 2018 is paid out over summer 2019). 4) Thanks for the warning OP. Not something I had ever thought of. I'm curious how this would typically work for positions that start on July 1st. Presumably they are paying you over the first summer, but you wouldn't have worked the previous Spring so the pay would not come from there. 5) Had the same happen to me but fortunately I had a summer salary that made up for the difference, but that was just a big coincidence. ","Take aways from failed unfruitful job seasons Trying to stay upbeat and look for places to improve on another year of no interest from search committees.  I'd like to hear from people that had successful job searching outcomes following one (or more!) seasons where their applications garnered little or no interest. What changed? What would you have done differently that you think would have helped you on the job market? 2) I had no interest last year; this year I completely overhauled my research statement from top to bottom. I sent it out for comments from LOTS of people (targeting people who recently served on search committees) and then very carefully considered the common themes present in my feedback. It was surprising how people in very different fields had nearly identical things to say. I also had 3 versions of my research statement (one for evo bio jobs, one for eco/evo jobs and one for behavior jobs) that highlighted different aspects of my work. I spent a significant amount of time tailoring each application (e.g. how I could adapt my field work to their research stations or local environment, who I could collaborate with in the department or across departments, etc.). This strategy worked; I had 5 skype interviews, 3 campus interviews and two offers. 3) I had a much better year this year with multiple offers, but I applied more widely than in the past, and published a handful of papers in the interim. Still didn't do a ton to tailor applications, so I don't know that it's super necessary if you're applying to ads that are in your direct area (or broad ones that include your direct area) OP) Thanks for the quick feedback! I'd love to keep it coming. 4) Similar situation as 2 and 3, I had nothing last year, but five campus visits this year. I went through my research statement from top to bottom, also reaching out to folks that had recently landed jobs to look over their packages. I also applied slightly more broadly this year, but I also felt like there were better fits for the applications. So difficult to say what helped, but there is definitely a lot of variation between years 5) I'll echo what has already been said. Having TONS of eyes on all my documents. Taking a giant slice of humble pie and eating it all. Talking to lots of colleagues who recently got jobs about things that they did. And honestly, experience. My first few on campus interviews were not great, my talks go better, my questions got better, and my comfort level with being myself went up. I think all of those things contributed to landing what is literally a dream situation. I interviewed for broader and more specialized job ads, and got offers at both types of places. Keep trying and keep refining your ideas! 6) This is actually really helpful and encouraging to read x3 7) So I had a bunch of interviews last season, and this season... one interview (two if you count a staff position), and one instance of narrowly not making the shortlist. I think some of it's just noise. 8) I also went backwards this year. 6 phone 3 campus last year down to 2 phone 1 campus this year despite a bunch of publications in the interval. Who knows why. 9) 7 again. I will say that there were slightly more open positions in my area of expertise last time around. I've published some papers since, albeit not the main ones I need out. 10) After two unfruitful seasons and an end to my funding in sight, I took a good look at my CV and the CV's of those who were getting jobs in my field. I decided my problem was not enough pubs in high profile journals, and I confirmed this with a friend who was on one of the SC's. Then I buckled down. HARD. Over the course of the next year, I published 5 papers in top journals and submitted 4 more. This year I got 6 on-campus interviews and 3 offers. Don't get me wrong - I am NOT advocating sacrificing sleep and sanity to get a job! But just know that your competition is doing exactly that. Was it worth it? Yes, for me it was. But that's a personal choice that each of us must make for ourselves - I'd *never* advise someone to put themselves through this.

","Minimum salary asked on application I just filled out a job application that asked my minimum and desired salaries.  Any idea why schools do this? I used one of those cost-of-living calculators to get a rough idea, but I think this question is unfair. 2) I put ""commesurate with experience"" when i saw that stupid question, as it didn't require a number only 3) I put $1. I usually figure it's an HR thing and/or holdover from using a template that's not specifically designed for academic postings. 4) Is it required to move forward? I normally leave those and the CV-esque questions blank and had no issues. Is just HR using the same form for all types of employment. 5) It was required to move forward, and it was asked twice, once for minimum and once for desired.  Seemed like they really wanted to know, though what they're going to do with that information is unknown. 6) just put a reasonable number down, it likely won't be used in the actual hiring decisions 7) But it might. Why take the opportunity to shortchange yourself? Don't entertain them."

(2) All earbugs aside...does anybody know anything about the status of this job? It seems that an offer was made and rejected...are they still looking or did they cancel the search?
(3) They did not cancel the search; they told me they would move on to their second-choice candidate (decliner here).
(4) May I ask why you declined (in as much detail as you're comfortable with)? I heard some things about the dept/school/town that made me not apply for the job.
(5) The department seemed quite nice, actually, and the town is ok. I was seriously considering taking it. Unfortunately the offer did not meet my minimum needs, and they demanded an answer in about 4 days even though I told them I had more interviews. I decided I would be better off taking my chances.

I remember using a website that helped determine how solvent the insitution is but I can't seem to remember what it was. Any thoughts on this would be very helpful. I am interviewing at some SLACs and this information seems potentially important. 1) Ask them during the dinner conversation.  You'll get an answer of some kind. 2) the website you are probably thinking of is http://www.forbes.com/sites/schifrin/2013/07/24/is-your-college-going-broke/2/ 3) OP here thanks! That is not the website that I was thinking of but it is really helpful! I am wondering how important to factor in financial health of the institution when considering an offer. 4) you can also go to http://www.thesustainableuniversity.com.  It is great for scoping things out. Often times, just get a look at the faculty salaries and when the last raise came.  Also, what are the faculty driving, how does the dean/chair dress.  believe it or not, these things correlate sometimes! 5) Thanks #4! That is the one I was thinking of. Interesting note about what to look for. I must admit that for my dream job interview I had last year (at an R1 that I failed to get) the faculty was well-paid and I was picked up in a beater 1990s toyota.  Also, some of my concern isn't pay but also resources for teaching/research. I am applying to SLACs mainly. 6) The US News and World Report website lists the school's endowment, which for SLACs can be pretty informative about the resources available to faculty for teaching/research. 6) Try this: http://www.thesustainableuniversity.com/ [just saw that it had been suggested already - take it as an endorsement!] 7) Here's the one that I've used: http://chronicle.com/article/College/140495/  I think this is an important consideration, maybe not for your pre-tenure years, but you want to make sure your institution won't be in a crises in 10, 20, or 30 years. 8) #5, almost always salary, resources, and general working environment are strongly correlated. It just is.  Everywhere I have been has followed this pattern for good or bad.  9) #7, you have to think about this as you say, of course today so many schools are already in crisis, you have to ask how many will even exist 20-30 years from now, especially when you consider small liberal arts colleges and under-sized state universities. 10) I think comparing the Endowment/Enrollment ratio amongst the schools you're thinking of as a rough estimate of financial health. 11) What is considered a ""healthy"" endowment/enrollment ratio?

",WTF UC Davis - why require an excessive amount of application materials - it's a huge pain to write all these and 90% of applications will be thrown in the trash based on CV alone. 2) I agree. But I applaud your optimism if you think that number is 90% and not more like 98%!!,"How much time per application? Just curious what the rate of offers declined looks like and how it varies. My only experience was at an R1, and I don't know how it varies by institution type, geography, pay, etc. Seeing some offers here declined and searches reposted after they (presumably) failed for one reason or another triggered the question. 2)  I'm not sure I understand what you're asking. op) Looking at the info on the negotiations page, some small places pay so little ($44K, $0 startup), it makes me wonder how often offers are declined at those places. 3) in this market?  Hardly ever, that is why the pay is so low.  at $44K, if you are a family of 4, you are eligible for WIC.  A national faculty union with teeth was needed 30 years ago, things are worse now. 4) It looks like at least of couple of the people on the negotiation board got multiple offers, so at least some (I would venture most) of the declined offers are from people that have better options on the table. 5) I know that I and several of my peers declined campus interviews this year because of the starting salaries mentioned during the phone/Skype interview. There is no tab for reporting that information on here.","Scared that I'll never have the teaching experience that they require for most academic jobs, having focussed on research for my whole career.

It seemed to work.","Latest update column 1) Can someone add a latest update column so we can sort by the posts with the most recent changes?  Thanks!  2) You mean on the main job listing page?  1) Yeah, for the date of the latest update, it's hard to see when people get interviews.  For some reason, it won't let me add a column. 2) OK I added one (the sheet is protected against vandalism).  Look OK?  Hope it didn't break anything! 1) looks good so far.  Thanks!","Any advice for looking older as a woman? I'm seriously concerned that looking young is a negative factor in my job search.  2) Blazers, but not matching suits.  Pull your hair back if it's long.  Wear glasses not contacts if that's an option for you.  Choose simple jewelry with clean lines, but don't be afraid to wear earrings.  Wear heels, unless you can't walk in heels.  I get more respect when I'm eye-to-eye or taller.  Fewer men talk over me, contradict me, etc.  On the male side I did have a friend who grew a beard just so he wouldn't look so young on interviews.  Gaining weight also makes people look a little older, but usually the travel and dinners on interviews takes care of that for you. ;)  3) we had a very young, female applicant at our R1.  Her youth was most apparent in her perspective on her career & career stage and her vision of what her lab would look like.  Some of the faculty in my department were opposed-- too early career, might be a star, but might not be ready for this (don't want to throw someone in over their head).  For various reasons, she got the job anyway.  Point is: her youth was most apparent in her bearing and intellectual maturity, not her appearance. 4) OP here. Thanks for the advice - I'll definitely be taking some of it! Also, no thanks to #3. That's clearly not what I meant. Anyone that doesn't have their act together and seems ""not ready for this"" will be at a disadvantage. However, for women in particular, a young appearance alone can put you at a serious disadvantage. 5) I routinely get mistaken for someone who's ~8 years younger than I really am, although I'm 5' 8.5"", so I'm not sure if the two extra inches of heel make a difference. However, in case it's not totally obvious, having clothes altered can make you look less as though you're wearing your mother's outfit. I considered contouring to make my face look ""pointier"" but didn't get around to finding a suitable shade that wouldn't be apparent. 6) There may be some well-intentioned advice-givers here, but if you're going to not answer someone's question and kinda make the same type of stereotypes in your answer that someone is trying to avoid, consider not offering it. 7) I have the same problem as the OP! I cut my hair to above my shoulders and wear a blazer/slacks both days of the interviews.  I do wear shoes with a little bit of a heal but only because I'm very short.  I really hope that my young looks do not put me at a disadvantage but I don't want to take that chance. 8) For every year on the job market you will age 5 years, so just stick with it! 9)<--made me LOL, but I have found this to be so true unfortunately. I feel as though I can identify new patches of grey hairs after every interview.","Non-anonymous revisions? Here's something I've wondered about when looking in the revisions - why does someone's name occasionally come up? As in, instead of anonymous animal, it's just..them 2) The chat button warns that you will no longer be anonymous if you click it","Posted this below but may be different enough for a new rant - curious how different. Inferiority complex time: Competing against an assoc. prof for an asst. prof position. No way a postdoc CV is objectively better than someone post-tenure. This feels like a losing situation :( ?  2) I don't have any data or experience with this kind of situation to lean on, but I would argue that it's NOT entirely a losing situation. These things often (or perhaps frequently) do not rest simply on the quality of the CV. I constantly see really, REALLY good applicants getting passed over in favor of people with objectively poorer records. The horribly vague and subjective issue of 'fit' looms largely. In your case, you'd be cheaper than a tenured prof, and somewhat less risky in that if the tenured prof is a nut, their new colleagues would be stuck with them for a long time. So I think you have a fairer shot than you might think. 3) As a grad student, I witnessed a search with one associate prof going against lesser-titled candidates, and the associate prof didn't get the offer. I think everyone preferred the interactions and research of the other candidates.  4) I'm an associate prof and applied for an Assistant/Associate search near Austin last job season and didn't even make the short list.  They ended up giving it to an Assistant Prof.  I don't even bother applying for Assistant Prof positions most of the time anymore, as I usually don't make the cut.  Many Assistant Prof searches don't have the money to bring folks in at the Associate Prof level and think they'll be hard to negotiate with, so they just seem to pass us over.  So, I don't think you are at a huge disadvantage in terms of those examples, but I will also say that prior to landing my current position, I lost most of the other offers I applied for to folks with more experience, so it seems like it can go both ways.  This job season I've applied to about 10 jobs and have had two phone interviews and have been invited to two on-campus interviews.  The two on-campus interviews I have are for one position advertised as an Assistant/Associate gig and the other was advertised as an Assistant prof, but in talking to the chair at the latter, I'd have to drop down to the Assistant level to take that one, so there's a cost there for us too.  Note that tenure rarely transfers even if you go in as an Associate, so that scares a lot of Associates away as they get complacent with their tenure even if they hate where they currently are.  ..and an FYI, in terms of those two on-campus interviews, I'm nervous as shit and am in no way thinking I've got either of those in the bag despite knowing I'm up against some postdocs 5) As a tenured prof with a pretty good CV, I have been 100% successful at getting phone interviews over the last 6 or 7 years (all jobs advertised at the Assistant rank except one, which was advertised at the Associate rank). #1, I only apply for jobs where the job description fits me perfectly. #2, as the OP stated, I have a much more developed CV than most post-docs and graduate students. Here is the important number for you post-docs and graduate students: I have been 0% successful in receiving campus interviews over that time period for jobs posted at the Assistant rank. However, I did receive a campus interview for the job offered at the Associate level. In every search committee that I have ever been on (15+) for jobs offered at the Assistant level, we have only ever offered a campus interview to one tenured applicant, and that candidate was not offered the job. My advice to young faculty has always been to keep applying for jobs while pre-tenure because once you get tenure your mobility decreases considerably. OP here) thanks everybody. processing... I definitely never take a situation for granted either since there are so many aspects to ""fit""... even if an interview seems to go well who knows what decisions will be based on, and that overshadowing experience is pretty real, and intimidating... it will always be stressful and even more complicated, sacrificing tenure would be a big deal for sure... I really do wish that everybody could have a job they are happy with! ! 5 again), the last thing you said is something I talk about all the time with my spouse. I have lots of friends in jobs that they don't like but I would love (for a multitude of reasons; e.g., location, more pay, fewer contact hours, etc...), and I'm sure that there are people who would love my job. Maybe there is someone out there that would love my job and I would love theirs? Too bad we can't trade ourselves. 6) Let's start a job swap tab on the wiki. 7) Wow I didn't even realize that post-tenure folks so commonly apply for pre-tenure positions. ""Asst/Assoc"" makes sense but I guess the prospect of giving up tenure surprises me 8) #7, it depends. Sometimes it could be to accomodate a spouse. Sometimes it is for higher pay. An assoc. at PUI could be making 60-70 while an asst. at an R1 could be making 80-90...  9) Would coming from a long stint at a PUI make you competitive at an R1 though...? 10) It is hard to move from PUI to R1 unless you have managed to publish and get grants at a typical R1 (or even better than R1) pace.","no word from SC Was interviewed onsite 6 weeks ago, SC told me they would need at least 2 weeks to announce decisions. Haven't heard anything. I have no other offers, but another on-campus interview in early April. As far as I'm concerned, they can take their time because I would like to see the other place. Yet, the anticipation is killing me. I have little leverage with which to bug them at this point, and maybe 4 extra weeks is within the reasonable window of committees being delayed (besides, I was Skyped in early October so they have been pretty slow to begin with). What is the deal with this situation? 2) Were you the last person to interview? If so, 6 weeks is definitely on the long end - I suspect the offer has been made to someone else, and they will wait to notify you until the offer has been accepted (or declined). That being said, of the places I've interviewed, one gave an offer less than a week after the last interview, one explicitly said that it would at least 6 weeks after final interview to make an offer, and one was supposed to be quick and took over a month, likely because there was some disagreement among the faculty over who to hire. 3) I was not the last to be interviewed. I was hoping that it's common practice to tell candidates where they stand (#2, #3, not acceptable etc) once an offer is made. Perhaps that's not the case and they've offered it to somebody. Perhaps they haven't even discussed it yet. 4) I've never been told where I stand - only got a rejection after an offer is accepted. 5) that sucks. multiple advisors have told me their SCs make it a point to do that sort of thing so I was of the impression it's a best practice. 6) A place I interviewed recently told me they're not allowed to give you any info after the interviews until an offer is accepted (so they can't tell your standing even if they want to). I've heard of this info being disclosed elsewhere though. 7) On the most recent SC I served on, we strategically didnt rank candidates after our top pick. If we ranked them 1-4, 1 declines and 2 and 3 accept jobs elsewhere in the meantime, its hard to convince our Dean that we want our 4th choice. It would be easier for him to say ""4th isnt good enough, it was a failed search"" and failed searches aren't guarenteed to get run again. For this reason, we cant tell candidates where they stand if they arent given the initial offer. 8) I've heard of this happening too, but in my experience I've never been told where I stood or gotten any kind of feedback at all after a campus visit other than an offer or, eventually, a rejection. 9) OP here, I have been offered this job! Not sure if I was first or second choice, but it doesn't matter cuz I'm first now. 10) Nice! Good for you! I was the last interviewed, 3 weeks ago...I guess they made at least an informal offer last week and I am still hoping the first choice declines the offer...and maybe the second too. 11) Congrats, OP!!","I just got a rejection letter from a school I applied to last season. 2) Ouch yes! That happened to me in September, as I was preparing an aplication for another position at the same university. 3) Oh an email from X institution, I better click on it and see what it is about. Oh really, you filled the position, a year after I submitted my application. I seriously thought I was still in the running since I hadn't heard a single update from you for the last year. I just thought you were busy fighting off mudhens and swamp apes and that delayed your search. But thanks for the email a year later to remind me that I'm not good enough and should probably pick a new profession like hamster breeder or cobbler for the renaissance fair. x2 4) LOL @ #3. This is interesting. Yesterday I also received a rejection email from R1 school where I was one of the 3 finalists in November, 2017! In contrast, I received a rejection phone call today regarding another faculty position for which this school interviewed me on-campus just a month ago. Nevertheless, still waiting for this mid-size school (where I was finalist in 2015) to ""inform"" me that they hired somebody else. LOL. 5) #3 again, the search committee will say they are busy and don't have time to email every candidate yet the same committee will request your letters up front requiring hundreds of letter writers to waste their time for candidates who will never be considered. You can at least send a timely rejection to those who made it to the skype stage and beyond. 6) AGREED","Negotiations Based on public records, no AP make more than $50K at a small state University. If an offer is made in the mid 40's, would it be worth negotiating to try and get $50? Or would you be risking the offer being pulled? Has anyone had success in this case? 2) Always worth negotiating. You need to ask for what you need in order to be happy 3) $50K is reasonable. They would be way over reacting to pull the offer just because you asked for a couple extra thousands. x2 3) That sounds like a very typical negotiation, they offer 45, you ask for 50, and they will then offer you 47. If you want 50, I would ask for a bit more than 50.   4) I got more than 50 as a senior pdoc.  That's a pay cut.  Is it possible they expect you to pick up more teaching to get a full salary?  A lot of community colleges do that model, but unis usually don't.  Even then, seems off. 5) Small schools will often tout how it's a 9-month salary and you can get more from grants over the summer if there's a research component to the job....even when very few of the current faculty have grants.  I'm in a low cost of living location, and the local community college is hiring a full time instructor.  I looked into it, and their 1st year pay for someone with no teaching experience, an MS but no PhD, and not teaching over the summer is still ~$55k.  (Pay is set by a union bargaining agreement and is public record -- it's based on years of experience and highest relevant degree for the teaching faculty.  I applied.)  It's highly variable from institution to institution.","Completely rewrote my application materials for a job I am really interested in, and uploaded the wrong version of a teaching statement.  Corrected the issue last week, but I know the committee has already looked at applications.  Ugggh, all my fault, but so frustrating all the same to lose a chance I was qualified for based on my own stupidity. 2) Did you submit the new teaching statement after the closing date? If not, I doubt anyone looked at your app yet. At my university, we wouldn't have access to your app (or anyone elses) until a day after the closing date, when all the apps get dumped into a folder on the university network.  3) #1 here - The new statement went on to the portal a week after ""application review"" began.  So I suspect the wrong statement has already been downloaded, if not viewed. I don't know if the committee has thoroughly reviewed applications yet... 4) #2 here - I doubt it will matter much. Most probably haven't started looking at applications. Also, in my experience on job searches (12+), I've only ever come across one teaching statement that really made me say, ""wow, that's awesome,"" and one statement that made me say, ""this person is not a good fit."" The vast majority fall into the category, ""sounds like they could do a good job.""  5) I think you are being overly pessimistic. Your CV is what will be most important and I doubt that varies from app to app. And if there is some major mistake in the teaching statement, like stating the wrong school or something, I don't think one week after the closing date is too late to point out the error and send updated documents. 6) #1 here... if mistake was caught, it didn't matter, but according to a friend in the department, my research wasn't quite what the faculty wanted for the position.","When do folks provide a start-up list? I've had a couple different experiences with respect to start-up discussion. In one case, start up was discussed in a general manner during the on campus, with the expectation that a list would be asked for AFTER an initial offer was made. In another case, a list was requested BEFORE any offers were made (ie while on-campus visits were still ongoing). Any insights out there as to the usual sequence timeline of start-up list/first offer/negotiations? 2) I once had a list requested before any offers were made and found it really awkward because it felt like they might use the request as a screen to determine who they would make an offer to. It puts pressure to ask for less than you want/need in order to not get dinged in the selection process (even if that isn't the intention). 3) OP here. Thanks 2. Yes, it feels awkward to me too. Sounds like this is not the norm...Any other experiences out there? 4) Yes, I've heard of being asked before an offer was made. I would not like that. And I do believe it is part of the screening (or maybe tie braking) to see who gets the first offer 5) I've had conversations about ""start up"" in general on most of my visits, across institution type. I've never been asked for a list prior to an offer, but I can remember two times where the conversation got pretty detailed, like with specific dollar amounts. Both of these were for asst/assoc positions at big rich/growing institutions so they could have had the money for me if they want/ed to. First time I was caught off guard in a way I wouldn't have been if just asked about my 3-year research plan or something like that. Honestly in my case it was probably a good indicator I wasn't ready for that job! 6) Agree with 5. Itemized list is not the norm, but at the interview stage, discussion of equipment, lab space, anything unusual like support for fieldwork at remote site, etc. The dept. may have to go to the dean with a pitch for their preferred candidate and start-up needs is information that is good to have in hand, IE it can be used for more than disqualifying/ranking applicants. 7) OP here. Thanks all this is extremely helpful. 6, that makes sense, seems like that is the case for me"
"Tenure  This is off topic, but holy crap!  http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE61B59V20100213  Apparently some faculty are more stressed than the job searchers 1) Not ""stressed"" so much as ""unstable."" I think there's a difference. Very sad.

2) A colleague and good friend of my spouse worked with the alleged shooter and described her as ""an odd duck."" As is becoming more apparent given her history, she indeed was not a stable person.  3) So, such ""odd duck"", ""unstable"" persons could at least get TT track jobs at the beginning, but so many of us ""regular"", ""relatively sane"" folks are left out here hanging dry and can't even get an interview. WTF is this world coming to? 4) she developed some technology that generated big bucks.  ",Old Dominion University What's the source of the short list being made? Have the candidates been contacted? (1) 3 final candidates are being brought in for interviews in late April. (2) Thanks for the info - I guess I'm out of the running...,NA,NA,NA,"Ok, so here's how it seems to me: At a small liberal arts college, the expectation is that you will teach all the time. At an R1 university, the expectation is that you will do a lot of research and bring in a lot of money. At a masters-level university, the expectation is that you will teach all the time *and* do a lot of research and bring in a lot of money. Am I wrong about any of this? 1) There's actually a lot of variation in Master's level institutions.  Some have high teaching loads (4/4 if not more) whereas some are around 2/2 if not lower.  Some may or may not have high research expectations.  It's interesting that you pointed this out because there is an extreme amount of variation in these types of places. 2) Does anyone out there work at a masters-level place with a realistic teaching load and realistic research expectations? 3) What is meant by a 4/4 (or 2/2) teaching load? Does 4/4 mean 4 different classes? How are labs factored into this? I have interviewed at MS, SLACs, and an R1. The teaching load and research expectations differ quite a bit with insititution types. I just interviewed at an elite SLAC and the teaching was less than that of a good MS position I interviewed at a year ago. 4) Agreed there is lots of variation.  Some Master's level institutions have a ""sliding scale"" with some faculty being more research intensive and others being more teaching intensive - it is up to you what path you want to take.  The insitution I'm at has a typical load of 3/3 (labs = 1), but I've never taught that load because of high research productivity and big grants (was 1/1 last year and 2/1 this year).  5) there is tons of variation at all but the R1.  The expectations at SLACs can run the gamut from 6 hr teaching and research expecations to boot, to 20 sem hrs per semester taught with no research at all.  Regionals are all over and vary by department, not by school.  You have to look at the faculty and see what they are doing to know.  I would say most expect teaching 12 hr, some 9 hr with MS program.  Most expect some research to make tenure.  Many active regional faculty do small-time research or research of regional/local signficance, this is important and needs to be done too.  However, the work load at regionals can be over-the-top.  I just reviewed a manuscript looking at stress at regional universities.  Its off the charts.  6) This is a really interesting discussion. The manuscript quantifying stress at regionals is interesting. Did it compare MS to SLAC to R1s? Most of my mentors have told me to apply to either R1 or SLAC but never MS as they can be the worst of both worlds. 7) You have a good mentor, #6. Writing as someone at an MS-level place, I think your mentor is spot-on. 8) #6/#7 correct.  No, but it cited many papers on R1s.  My personal experience having taught at all of these also supports #6/#7.  R1s and SLACs at least have some form of a mission.  regionals are all over the place. 9) For the record, even the ""low-end"" teaching load quoted here (2/2) makes it very difficult to get research done. But if you're at such a place with a 2/2 load, they'll expect research at levels not that different from an R1. Expect to grade papers all night and do all your manuscript writing during breaks (""vacations."") Writing grants? Ha! You'll miss a bunch of deadlines, or else get into fights with your spouse about the extra time you'll need to write them. Come tenure-review time, you'll be judged not too differently from your piers at R1s. Do yourself a favor and stay away from those places. I'm at one. 10) Also note that no one from an MS-level place is actually commenting here to refute the bad situation they create. One of the commenters here said that MS-level places are all over the place in terms of teaching load, but no one here has said they're happy with the expectations there in their own first-hand experience. 11) #4 here again, I was recently tenured at a large MS-level school, it was not difficult achieve well above the bar and find a balance between research, teaching, and service expectations. And I still manage to have time for a kid, a spouse, and a life. Every school (R1, MS-level, or SLAC) really is what you make of it.  R1 has much higher expectations for grants ($1 million and/or NSF), pubs (quantity and quality, e.g., Nature, Science, Ecology or out) and the pressure is on from day 1.  MS or SLAC don't have these extreme research expectations.  My school the minimum bar is 3 pubs (at least one started and completed since arrival, i.e., not postdoc) and attempts to get external funds, plus high quality achievement in teaching...like I said, not difficult. 12) #6 here again...Thanks 11. I actually thought that the people I met with when I interviewed at the MS seemed pretty happy. My mentors may be correct but they had never taught at an MS school. In looking at some of the MS schools, your assessment (a pub or two a year in a mid-tier journal) seems about midway between an average R1 and SLAC. 13) #12, actually, they are what they are and you are not going to make anything out of them but what they are, this is at all schools.  If you are at dead-wood city or a research center, you better do in Rome as the Romans do or get trashed. 14) Thanks #4 for the helpful insight into the world of M1 schools. Clearly expectations vary highly among institutions. Do you (or anyone else with M1 experience) have any suggestions for figuring the expectations during the interview? Ask directly? Is there any way to figure this out pre-interviews?  12) it takes a different kind of person to be happy at this kind of school.  Generally, the ones who do research in these conditions have unusually broad set of interests and find enjoyment in a large array of activities.  Also, despite what many will tell you, I have found that the energy levels and talent levels at midmajors are just as deep if not deeper than at doctoral programs.  However, I am speaking of the good ms level schools.  It seems like some of these are centers for people who just don't do anything and are lucky to have academic posts.  For some reasons, regional state schools, especially departments without MS programs tend to have a lot of deadwood.  Just the way it is. 15) #4 here again.  Ask directly about requirements (# pubs, achievement in teaching, amount of service, etc) for tenure and promotion.  Most departments have bylaws that explain these requirements.  If the requirements are not clear or subjective, I would see this as a red flag (at any school: R1, M1, SLAC).  Be direct and ask these questions before or during an interview, a search committee will expechem.  You can always email these questions to the search/department chair.  They may even be able to send you a copy of the department bylaws with a description of the requirements for T&P. 16) Thank you #4. 17) I'm just going to say it, if you can't get research done with a 2/2 load, you better leave academia because most jobs are 3/3 or higher. 18) It depends what kind of research you want to get done. The fact is that people at schools with 2/2 loads or higher do not typically publish in the best journals or get NSF grants. Of course there are exceptions, but this is generally the case (and the exceptions are almost always people who were given special treatment early on that allowed them to get on the funding gravy train and then perpetually buy themselves out of their ""normal"" teaching burdens). The research at schools with higher teaching loads will be done on much more of a shoestring (or be contract work for Army Corps of Engineers or something, far removed from basic science), and the publication rate will be a lot slower. There are only so many hours one has in a day without getting divorced and/or raising deprived children. If you teach more, you research less. Or if you teach more and research the same, you will go crazy/lose your family. 19) Also be aware that at M1 schools they expect you to buy yourself out of teaching (you know, with all that extra money in all of your six-figure grants). The attitude tends to be ""if you don't like your teaching load, then suck it up and pull yourself up by your own bootstraps!"" There is no real institutional support at those places to foster a strong research culture, even though they will expect research from you (more than is realistic given that you probably don't live alone and you have to sleep at night) to get tenure and promotions. One more thing: Notice that the comments here from people supporting the Masters school model are basically saying ""suck it up and deal with it!"" Well, they do have a (meta-)point: if you're taking a job at a MS-level place, then you'd better suck it up and get used to that attitude, because that's what you'll get at every turn. #17) BS.  Plenty of high caliber research based on large grants gets done with a 2/2 to 3/3 load.  I've done it.  As for Science and Nature, you don't shoot for Science or Nature, you shoot for the top journal in your discipline with Science and Nature being used if a study is especially competitive.  Some folks are especially unique and land in their every few years, most are lucky to get in it once, and that includes people at Major R1s.  Further, getting in science or nature on a paper as the 44th co-author hardly counts as legit.  If you can't do it on a 3/3 load you won't be able to do it on a 2/2 load, a 1/1 load or any other load.  You are dreaming.  I had half a million in grants after teaching 18 sh for a year, then bought out my contract, it can be done and its not that darn hard.  Frankly, you need ot go do some frank research, most peole on any load don't publish at any level.  Those on 2/2 publish in Ecology, Amer Nat, &c frequently.  ITs just not that hard to do with that much time on your hands.  Now, that is all assuming the service committments are comparable.  Sometimes they are not and that will kill productivity more than teaching.  That does not mean, however, that you should WANT to do this.  I'm just assuring you that its not that hard if you need too. You definitely SHOULD NOT WANT TO DO THIS!!!  But, it beats unemployment.  Most of these schools will give you course release with only a course or two your first year.  Just use this to get the $$.  I did not have this benefit where I was!  BTW: The best reason to not take a job at regionals is to avoid dealing with the deadwood faculty who are sometimes common.  These folks are really dangerous if they have tenure and tend to destroy departments (from a research perspective) if a few of them get seniority at once.  You can identify one when he/she says, ""I work on education.""  Then, check their CV, if they are not publishing in education, but say they emphasize teaching or education, it means they don't do anything but the are minimum they have too.  They can be a big thorn in your side. IF there are a lot of them, they will be a hornet's nest to deal with. 18) This is a really interesting point #17. I have only interviewed at a regional. But about 1/3 of the faculty were total deadwood. When I met with them, all they wanted to talk about was the union and how important it was (I am pro-union but would have expected to first discuss my teaching and research). I think there was a lot of conflict in the department. That being said, the deadwood was usually older (but this was not always the case) and I am guessing that the department will change over the next 5 years. 19) The numbering system in this thread has gotten a little recursive/confusing, but such things happen! Anyway, I think the main point still stands that the overall job ahead of you is likely to be harder at a regional institution than at either a SLAC or R1. Sure, you CAN get research done with a 3/3 load. You CAN buy yourself out of all your courses. Etc. But look at how much extra work you have to do. Sure, it beats unemployment, but if you are able to stay in that post-doc for an extra year and try again, it might be worth it. 20) #19, I agree with this, its harder but not impossible.  ",NA,"how much to tell about other options 1) If you are going to decide to interview for a VAP position at a SLAC, you need to understand that it's still a job interview and that you should do a little homework before you show up. And also ask questions about what the teaching load is actually like, how new faculty have handled their teaching loads and what the students are like. It makes you look like a completely terrible fit otherwise if all you want to talk about is teaching students how to do research. Be aware that your #1 job in a VAP position is to give you teaching experience and, perhaps, some mentoring experience. But teaching is by FAR the #1 priority. 2) As a TT faculty member (edit: at a SLAC, too), this is not a universal perspective.  Teaching students how to do research should be a priority for all biology faculty.  Teacing being the #1 priority and being very interested in teachng students how to do research are not mutually exclusive. 3) I totally agree with 2.  In fact I'd say teaching students anything substantive about the knowledge created by science is misguided unless you also teach them a great deal about the process. 4) OP again. I will clarify. If you only talk about your interests in research while interviewing at a SLAC and ask zero questions about teaching, you aren't going to get the job. Of course incorporating a working knowledge of research into the classroom is important. That is not what I was saying..","At R1s they only care that you aren't terrible at teaching, and the jobs seminar is sometimes viewed as your chance to be clear and speak to a broad audience.  Papers matter so much more. If you think it's really holding you back find an outreach event to teach at sometime over the coming year. ","TT vs non TT I'm game for people posting whatever jobs someone here might land, in the interest of maximizing employment, but I'd prefer anything that's not a tt faculty position  to go on a separate page (the one dedicated to non TT positions). Thoughts? 2) I agree that postdocs shouldn't get mixed in, but I don't mind long-term non-TT positions (like a few curator positions).","The magic (not) of networking: at a small meeting, a professor stated that she would serve in an SC and invited me to send her my research statement, etc. for feedback. Sent her the documents and no response... After a week I've applied, and just found out that I wasn't even long-listed... Oh, great! 2) Similar thing happened to someone I know - they were approached twice for two different positions at the same university, encouraged to apply because of ""the great fit"" by someone who they have (succesffully) worked with for years, and they didn't even get long-listed. They got a rejection letter within a month of submitting the application. I doubt networking works. 3) My sense (& experience) suggests that it takes a minimum of 2 people on a search committee (of six - for larger or smaller committees this number may be different) to get someone an interview. Consequently, you could be genuinely invited to apply for a position by someone who is on the search committee and who is very enthusiastic about your application, but fail to get an invitation merely because they are all alone in their enthusiasm. Don't be dismayed. It happens everywhere & its probably still worth it to keep working on getting your name out there as well as in getting to know your colleagues. 4) That's tough, and I genuinely sympathize. But I'd like to add that 0/2 is not significantly different than my own non-networked job search results. If your odds go from 1/60 to 1/8, that's a big improvement but one that is hard to detect. 5) OP here, I see what you mean guys, I agree. I guess I'm mostly dissapointed by the profesor not  bothering to even respond to my email. 6) Don't take it personally OP – we're all so overloaded with email & other shit that emails inevitably slide. 7) Many search committees divide up the applications so the professor in question may not even have evaluated your application. I would also think that someone on the SC should not actually be sending you feedback on your application materials - seems like an odd offer to make. 7). That situation seems a to be across the line, but in general, I've leanred that faculty and search committees will beat the bushes on twitter, email, etc. to encourage ""eligable"" candidates to apply. From the department's perspective, we want to choose through 100's of applicaitons. So, if you get what feels like positive feed back at any stage of the search (including the interview) it may not mean as much as you might think. 8) Been there myself, almost the same exact thing.  STRONGLY encouraged to apply after a meeting at a conference and then....crickets.  Didn't even make the long list.  One thing to note: This could be a red flag that you have a posion letter-writer.  How confident are you in your references?  That was the source of my issue. 9) OP here, I didn't even get to the stage when the SC asks for the letters so that wasn't the problem. One thing some faculty told me is that my foreign name might play against me. I read some research that these kinds of biases (even unintentionally) exist but there is no way to know if this is the case. I never got long listed so maybe... (this issue probably belongs to another venting discussion...) 10) Frankly, I think that the worst kind of 'foreign sounding' name to have is a name that sounds Chinese or Indian. The reason being that in my experience searches often receive many applicants from China or India that are not appropriate. (Either unqualified or, more often, totally mismatched with the search.) Thus, if you have a name that is Chinese or Indian you may risk being mistakenly miscategorized as falling into this group. 11) The saddest part is that, with all the EOE political correctness against discrimination based on race, sex, age, religion, sexual orientation, etc., etc., it's perfectly legal to discriminate against an applicant based on citizenship/immigration status. And it's been progressively getting worse in the last decade. The DHS has made it so hard for employers to sponsor H1B visas that most schools straight out refuse to consider any international candidates, even when they have obtianed their degrees from American institutions. Donald Trump really wasn't the original politician to discriminate on immigrants and use them as scapegoats. 12) ""The DHS has made it so hard for employers to sponsor H1B visas that most schools straight out refuse to consider any international candidates"" - I haven't seen any evidence of  this. Maybe it occurs at small colleges, but certainly not at R1/R2 institutions. (**I was hired on an HIB and have since served on multiple faculty searches in which we have interviewed or hired foreigners. I have also seen many friends & colleagues from abroad hired at U.S. institutions.) 13) #11 again. What #12 said about at R1/R2 schools might be true, but the phenomenom I described is definitely true for most of the smaller institutions. When I interviewed at the regional univeristy that I'm currently at, I was told that they don't provide any visa/green card sponsorships. I was lucky that I already had my green card by then so I was able to accept the offer. I have at least one friend who eventually didn't get an offer after a promising campus interview at a medium sized state university because they didn't want to bother with the bureaucracy and cost involved with sponsoring H1B's. Not all of us are lucky enough to get offers at R1 schools, but that doesn't mean that we deserve less of an opportunity in US academia. 14) #12 here. I believe you #13, although I have not seen this myself. I think sometimes *faculty* are unaware of the fact that their own university routinely sponsors H1B & green card applications and this could prejudice their evaluation of particularly candidates (either explicitly or implicitly). This can occur simply if a foreigner has not been hired in the department within the institutional memory of the search committee. An unwillingness of the university (at an institutional level) to sponsor a foreign national for the H1B & green card is incredibly short-sighted as the costs are extremely modest (<$1500 and about $5000, respectively)  compared to the long-term cost of hiring a faculty member.",One long or two short postdocs?   ,"My only recent new followers on Twitter are bots.

I had an on campus interview for a job on this board and an offer is supposed to be coming down this week (or maybe it already has... read on!). About ~2 weeks after my on campus, from out of the blue, I get an email from one of the search committee members yesterday asking me questions about his research and how methods I had mentioned in my talk could inform his questions. Not fully knowing where the committee is in their decision making process and because it is the kind of thing I normally answer when someone asks me, I played along and googled the answers for him. I then get a follow-up email  thanking me for my insight and asking more questions, which he prefaced with: ""I don't know when X will make his decision or if he already has [[I hadn't asked about this]], but I wanted to ask a few more questions ..."" (This guy picked me up, had a breakfast with me, bumped someone else from a lunch with me... we literally spent 3 hours together during my campus visit.) He starts asking about the research ideas I had (wanting more details) and wanting more specifics about my plan for ehancing the course I would be responsible for (which he is currently responsible for and doesn't really want to relinquish, but the job posting specifically wanted the incoming candidate to revamp and teach). After this, looking at the overall situation, I am just thinking WTF!?!?! Did you just find out that they aren't offering me the job and now you are pumping me for information because you are afraid that if I find out that I am not the successful candidate I am going to not communicate further? (which is true in terms of freely sharing novel ideas) I am tempted to just reply that 'such things are best discussed with the successful candidate.' My current PD supervisor told me not to respond further and that it was completely inappropriate for him to be contacting me. I am going with her advice, she usually doesn't steer me wrong. 2) Wait, do you know you didn't get the job? 3) OP. No I do not know for sure. I am inferring it (from that exchange and other things learned during the interview process). Maybe my inference is wrong. I will update either way.  4) If you liked the guy who is emailing you, then maybe this is a great opportunity to set up a collaboration even if you don't get the job? But if you didn't like him, or got a weird vibe, then I would just politely defer responding and/or only give vague answers until he gets the picture that he can't keep pumping you for free info/insight/whatever. Sorry that you're having such a weird interaction with him! 5) OP. I liked him more than I disliked him, but I classified him as a high investment low return individual. 6) It's totally irresponsible of him to let you know about the status of the search while also trying to get information out of you like that. Sounds like you may have dodged a bullet from a dysfunctional department. 7) I agree that is some horseshit, but please keep us updated! This is so interesting.  8) He shouldn't be contacting you while the search is ongoing, but I would not necessarily interpret this as meaning that a) the department is dysfunctional, or b) you didn't get the job.  Immediately assuming the worst and imparting the worst possible motives to other people are forms of cognitive distortion.  9) It's hard to tell what is happening from the outside. It could be that this guy is trying to get info so he could push for you or like others said, set up a collab.  Regardless, HR would probably tell you that this level of communication is not allowed before the decision is made, or even during negotiations.  Your best option is probably to suggest that you talk after the vote has been made.   You could contact the search chair to ask if you're allowed to have these discussions with him.  That's a friendlier way of alerting them something strange is happening--- we occasionally have to rein in faculty who act goofy.   And @8, don't blame the victim. It's not outrageous to be concerned, even if you think it's likely they are not bad actors.  10) OP  @9 I am not alerting anyone to anything. My rights have not been violated, it is at worst a clumsy attempt to take advantage of me intellectually. At best it is just procedurally inappropriate. Academia is hard enough, I going to save my policing for gross misconduct. Just putting it here to... well... vent... before I respond with collegial vaguery.  11) Crazy. I had a very similar experience to the OP when weeks after an interview, a SC member emailed me asking information about my study system (which was very close to their campus). I gave them info, thinking it would help them with their decision. Soon afterward, I found out that I didn't get the job, and then (from a grant proposal sent to me to review) that same person AND the new hire have now started collaborating on very similar questions to the ones I outlined during my talk, in my exact same study system! 12) Ouch!  13) Using interviewees to steal grant ideas is lame, unethical, and repulsive. 14) I would like to offer another perspective on this. A friend of mine went for an interview and during his PhD, proposed a new model in his specific research topic. The search committee was really impressed with him and one member of the search committee even kept calling him to find out more about the model and asked him very specific questions, even talking on the phone as he was at the airport waiting for his flight back home. My friend answered all their questions and was very friendly and open, even though they have not offered him the position yet. In the end, they offered him the position because they felt that he would make a very good and amicable colleague whom they can collaborate on their shared interests. In the event that most candidates are more or less equally qualified, personality and how the committee perceive you as a colleague makes a huge difference in hiring decisions, especially when you have to be a colleague to someone for a long time. 14) OP. Yes that scenario and your interpretation of it make sense, had it occured as you described it I wouldn not have thought twice. However, when you are the last interview and the follow-up comes 2 weeks after your interview... 14 here) @OP, I understand. It is a frustrating and confusing situation. Hopefully they will offer you the position. 15) Any news on the position, OP? 16) OP. No. In the meeting with the department head he ~promised to 'let me know by 2/16, because he was going on vacation, and it would end up being March before he responded otherwise.' An optimist could interpret that as maybe a decision hasn't been made, but he reiterated that 2/16 date several times. I interpret that as: An offer has been made to someone else, but they don't want to cut everyone else loose yet because they don't have a firm commitment. "," Has anybody ever been asked during an interview about how you would teach X class, without having been given any prior notice that you might be expected to teach X class? This happened to me. I knew from the job ad which classes they were interested in having taught, but then during the interview I was asked how I would teach a class in an entirely different department. It was awkward, since I had given no thought to teaching class X before. 2) I have had this happen during an on-campus interview during the committee meeting interview part. They asked about me teaching a specific class in the department and wanted details like what textbook I would use. I hadn't even thought about teaching that class. So when asked about this class and how I would teach it I took a generic approach about making the classroom fun and interactive, mixing lectures with discussion activities, blah blah blah. I also stated that I hadn't considered teaching that course as it didn't align with the job ad but that I would be super excited to teach it (even though this was no the case, you just need to seem excited to do every task they throw at you). The impression I have gotten during my interviews over the past seasons is that the faculty don't realize that it is often hard to find the course catalog or offerings online, especially for smaller universities with poor departmental webpages. 3) My experience from the other side: faculty are not all on the same page. Even when the job ad says one thing, different groups of faculty really want something else. So, when you go from person to person, their ideas about what you will do at the university can be very different. 4) That is the exact impression I got, totally different perspective on the position from the faculty members who asked about this class. Number @2s advice is really good.  5) This could also vary at R1 (low teaching load) vs SLAC (medium to high teaching load), which OP didn't say. At my R1 we typically don't hire for someone to teach a specific class even if we have a teaching need and are hiring in the area of our need.  This wouldn't stop individual faculty from being under the impression that a potential hire would teach a particular class. ","It's a real kick in the pants when you don't make the first cut for a job that felt like it was written for you.....x5 2) maybe their job description wasn't actually what they were looking for and wrote the job ad poorly, maybe there's weird internal politics, you will find the right job!  3) I swapped notes with a friend on the market one year.  We had comparable CVs in a similar field.  There was no rhyme or reason why one of us made the short list or long list.  You would think they'd at least request letters for both, but it was often not true. 4) this happens to us all; one thing that struck me when viewing this process from the other side is how random the whole process can be. Different committee members have different things they look for, and you can never know this from the outside when reading a job ad. It can be disheartening to see people with far less impressive records get interviews and jobs instead of you, but this isn't healthy. It really is highly random and shouldn't be taken personally. Also keep in mind that there likely were several committee members who wanted to learn more about you, but a single committee member can often sink an applicant if they want to. 5) I served in a search committee as a grad rep and went back to look at the notes and comments of each one of the candidates and noticed that the person who actually got the position, barely made the finalist list. ow that I'm in the job market and looking back at that one job search has opened my eyes on how subjective ths whole process is 6) I was on a committee that would only hire from a certain gender group in order to even out the gender ratio of our department. So it wouldn't matter how good you are if you weren't that gender. Choices are rarely made on merit. 7) merit can be very deeply rooted in privilege so I think that explicit efforts, such as #6 example, is very needed in order to ""even They ended up getting an on-campus interview because one of the search committee members advocated for them (had no connection whatsoever but committee member was very impressed with their professional trajectory and research statement) and during the on-campus interview the now assistant professor really overshadowed all of the other candidates. In addition, the candidate was not one of the ""best candidates"" in paper in terms of publications and fellowships/grants. Nout"" things in academia 8) @7, I don't disagree with you about the need for explicit efforts, especially in some departments/disciplines. But if that is the case the criteria should be stated. It is absurd to waste the time of hundreds of people applying for jobs they don't have a chance to get. Also, while I see what you mean about merit being rooted in privilege, I also think that the 'non-merit' 'fit' issues that often get people onto interview lists are often even more rooted in privilege (connections, pedigree, etc).  9) Knowing that part of the process if deeply ""random"", then what can we do with that knowledge? The problem is that knowledge provides us nothing, and we cannot do anything actionable with it, besides just ""more"" in hopes that helps. Thats the game, and we have to play it that way, I guess. 10) @9 big mood. 11) @8 I feel you and I also can't imagine a job ad where they explicitly state they're looking to hire someone from a specific gender or race. I can only imagine the national scandal. Headlines: university discriminates agains white men!!... seriously, what you're asking for won't happen so we will all continue to spend time submitting applications for jobs that we will be almost automatically disqualified for many reasons, one of those could be the fact that we're not the gender or race or ethnicity they're looking to hire. If this means equality in the future of academia, fine. 12) I wouldn't call that equality  13) Don't worry, Jeremy's data shows that plenty of white men are getting hired, particularly at R1's. Let's not pretend that the pendulum has swung too far the other way. 14) what is jeremy? 15) The Jeremy Bearimy Timeline 16) Statistics really aren't that comforting, that's not their purpose. In the end, everyone needs a job just as bad as everyone else. It isn't consoling if you're a white man (who personally had nothing to do with discrimination) applying in a tough academic job market. Sure, the numbers say you're doing well (as a gender/racial group), but it may not feel that way if your post doc job is coming to an end and there aren't many alternatives.  Yes, I'm a white guy. Yes, many women have the positions for which I interviewed. Yes, the places I interviewed had a long history of gender inequality. Good for them. I think they might be addressing problems their departments have. But I still don't have the job. But I can rest easy though knowing that women aren't going to be a minority and disadvantaged. As an academic and citizen, I can think that. As a competitor on the job market, no way. 17) *gender balance, it's that better @12? 18) Does anyone have any information about differences in gender and race in regards to metrics of merit at time of hire? Has any researcher published variations in hiring for TT academic positions across the sciences in recent years? Just curious if there are general benchmarks (h-index, citations, # 1st author, etc) or other targets for knowing whether one is ""competitive"" for their demographic or not versus national averges, as we tend not to get any feedback at all on any of these applications. 19) @16 so I'm just curious, as a competitor on the job market do you feel worse when you find out a job you applied to was given to a white woman or a POC compared to when it's given to a white men? I think we can all agree that the job market is really difficult for everyone, especially POC, and statistics haven't changed drastically in the past few years, so yeah the people getting the jobs are mostly white people, especially men. If anything, things are probably easier for white men than for any other demographic, so why don't aknowledge that. Every year there's the same conversation: white men upset because search committees are looking to hire white women or POC, well, guess what, chances are they'll end up hiring a white man either way. If you're a white man and not getting jobs, it's probably because another white man has a ""better"" CV than yours. Don't blame it on the white women or POC or any other slight effort to increase diversity in academia.  x2 20) White woman here. I know that jobs I interviewed for went to white men. x3 21) It is pretty frustrating that the only 'solution' to decades of unfair hiring seems to be to change hiring practices in a way that directly influences early career researchers who are at the most vulnerable career stage. Long tenured faculty are the ones who presumably benefited most from unfair hiring decisions, yet they aren't asked to make any sacrifice in their own careers to diversify academia. In fact, they can claim to be part of the solution by diversifying their trainees (for the record, I think that is a great thing for PIs to do, but it doesn't exactly require any sacrifice on their part). I realize that it is basically impossible for universities to do anything about this once people are tenured, but it seems like funding agencies could be doing a lot more to promote diversity among ECRs apart from waiting for departments to slowly hire more diverse assistant profs. What about shunting grant money into longer, more independent, ECR grants (similar programs already exist in Europe)? Get rid of or drastically reduce some of the grants designated for senior faculty and redirect that money to diversifying ECRs. Of course many senior faculty would not like that, but the goal is to increase diversity right? 22) @21 The NSF CAREER program does this and I don't know of any  ""grants designated for senior faculty""... 23) @22, to get an NSF CAREER you have to have a TT job first: not helpful for navigating the job market. NSF has OPUS grants specifically for senior faculty and of course a huge proportion of normal grants go to senior faculty but could be redirected to support ECR diversity. Many of the european funding mechanisms allow pre-tt ECRs to get extended research funding and independence with 5+ year grants that are sort of a transition from post-doc to tt.24) Is there any evidence that such an approach by Eurpoean funding agencies has resulted in a more diverse faculty? 23) I don't know that any of the European funding mechanisms have diversity as an emphasis (there may be some). What I'm saying is more that if diversity is such a huge priority (and I think it is), then it probably makes sense for the larger science community to divert more resources ($$) to the issue, rather than passively waiting for departments to slowly hire a more diverse faculty. 25) Are people serioulsy arguing that NSF and the like should be selectively funding ECR POC who already have TT jobs? 26) @23 True about OPUS but ""8 to 15 annually. Anticipated award size is $175,000-$350,000"" isn't actually a lot of money. 27) @25 where did you get that from? 28) It's not the same as a research grant, but NSF does specifically have a biology postdoc program for ""broadening participation."" Also, I've heard OPUS grants are typically intended for mid-career researchers with somewhat-lagging research careers that need a boost; i.e., if you've very recently been well-funded you're unlikely to get one. 29) Don't OPUS grants only fund writing activities? 30) @28, damn I'm planning on applying for an OPUS one day.  Now if I get it I'll have mixed feelings! :) 28) @30, I know someone who was thinking about one and then decided not to apply after talking to the program manager (they had been recently well-funded). When you're thinking about it, it's probably worth a chat with the program manager about the current goals of OPUS. 31) The solitication is pretty specific about OPUS, two tracks. One for Assoc Profs who need new skills or older faculty who are reviewing their work https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2018/nsf18582/nsf18582.htm","Okay to contact SC for update after on-site interview? I had an on-site interview early last month (first of three candidates), the last of the interviews would have been end of Jan. I have not heard from the search committee and assume that I am not their first choice/offer. However, I have another offer (non-TT, so not my first-choice) and would like an update from the search committee where I interviewed. Is it okay to email the search committee chair for an update, and what should I say in the email (mention other offer, etc). 2) I think it is totally fine to just let them know that you've received another offer but are still very interested in the position, and if there are any updates on the search. 3) Echoing #2, definitely email the SC chair and ask for an update; let them know you have an offer in hand, and you don't necessarily have to tell them it's an NTT post. 4) Further echo of #2/3, I was in a similar position this year and ready to take the first offer. However, after sending an update to the SC I recieved a second offer within ~48 hrs. "
"structural solution? Following up on the Scientific American article cited below... I got to thinking, and am wondering if the necessary structural change needs to be driven by the major funding agencies.  If NSF and NIH stopped funding postdocs (or drastically cut the number of postdocs funded), moved all this funding over to TT infrastructure grants (perhaps modeled after the current EPSCoR program), and then began requiring all budgeted time that would have been filled by postdocs to be made up in TT faculty time, then I'll bet the system could be brought back into balance very quickly.  Thoughts?   (1) That's a nice thought, but remember that TT faculty are much more expensive than postdocs. How many postdocs would have to be cut just to establish one of these grants? Add that to the fact that postdoc funding from the major agencies is already slim, and you have major attrition at the postdoc stage. The biggest problem we're facing is that the whole pie (i.e. the total budget for science/higher education) is too small, not that it's being sliced in the wrong way. (2) I second the points of #1, and add that it's particularly the pie of EEB that is too small. The NIH budget is like magnitudes greater than that of NSF. I think most people out there just don't give a $hit about ecology. (3) Although I agree with #1 and 2's point about money and the lack of support for EEB especially, I think the OP is correct. A structural change is needed. Although I am not familiar with the EPSCoR program (and my first look at the webpage didn't help), I would think that the solution is much more simple. Just allow post-docs to apply directly for existing grant programs or a special 5-year research grant to run their own program either within another lab or as their own lab. This is similar to the system in the UK (I don't remember the name of the program), where I recently spent some time. It seems to be a great system. The successful post-doc that gets these grants basically functions as Research Staff with their own budget and no teaching. A nice gig. Of course this would require more $$ and some ""top-down"" planning (very un-American). Another approach might be to allow all post-docs to be PI's if their are associated with a university. (4) #2 here. @ #3, I think this is already how we do it. I have a couple colleagues who got grants without being TT. One had a collaborator who's TT, and he's nominally the postdoc, but basically a co-PI. The other colleague got his own grant and is a research associate, with a nominal advisor. I maintain that the bigger problem is that the budget is too low for EEB, as attested by the extreme competitiveness in obtaining these grants, whether you're postdoc or TT. And you even agreed yourself that for the plan to work, there needs to be more $$. Isn't it nice that everything eventually comes down to money? (5) #3 again. Point well taken #2 (4), but I know a few who have written the grant and got the money but were not allowed to be the PI or co-PI due to institutional rules. Sucks but does make for nice LoR. I also have had the experience where when I mentioned that I would like to write a grant the ""boss"" basically stopped communicating with me and complained to the Chair that I could not because I did not have PI status at the University. I call him ""boss"" because he acted that way more than an ""advisor""/collaborator. Turns out the Chair told me later that I could easy be granted PI status by a simple faculty vote and this has never been turned down. Also turns out that the boss was appling to the same program for a competing grant (not NSF) and later to an NSF that was the same program that I was thinking about and could have easy helped on. Needless to say, I'm bitter (this is my vent) and not with the ""boss"" anymore (better post-doc in a much better department). (6) #4 that sucks!!!! Another issue here is graduate students - how many of you are willing to give up all but ""replacement"" graduate students and students who were not academia-track? (7a) I have written two NSF grants that were funded. I just put co-PI on my CV even though I do not officially have PI status. I am not willing to pretend like I didn't write the grant just because the institution doesn't recognize my efforts. If anyone wanted to confirm this, they could just ask my letter writer (co-PI, postdoc advisor) and he would confirm that I wrote the grants. My advisor would love if I wrote more grants - he'd hardly discourage me. Pretty odd story #5. That's akin to saying he/she doesn't want you to write papers either. Pretty backwards thinking. I'd run from that ""boss"". (7b) #2 again. Question for #6: What was your official status/affiliation when you were submitting the NSF proposals? If you do not have official affiliations with any school at the time of submitting (but can get a professor to collaborate on the proposal, perhaps a former mentor) will that hurt your chance? I've been hearing that it's hard to get grants without any institutional affiliation.
(8) I guess that you guys don't remember the situation 4-5 years ago, when there were very few post-docs, and this created a major bottleneck in hiring. Ultimately, it's a no-win situation - either there are too many post-docs, and not enough TT jobs for them when the finish, or there are too few post-docs, and lines don't get filled, or positions get filled by persons who are not good fits (though they may be excellent candidates for other positions, or not). (9) ""bottleneck"" #8? I don't remember that at all. But then I wasn't on the market then. Must have been nice, and I must have been the lucky few that got a glorious post-doc. (10) Well, if you were doing modeling or ecosystem ecology, maybe not. Most everything else was almost non-existent. And, as somebody who was looking for a post-doc back then, I can tell you that it wasn't nice at all, though I guess that it's all a matter of perspective, since that bottleneck may have helped those looking for faculty jobs the following two years. 
(11) I think there is a basic misunderstanding of what a ""bottleneck"" is by #9...scary for an ecology type, IMHO. Unless (s)he's being sarcastic...not uncommon here but hard to determine in print. (12) The numbering got jacked up so I renumbered my post 7a. In response to 7b, the grant went in to NSF with my postdoctoral advisor's name on it. I was listed in the personnel section and had to submit my NSF CV with the grant. So, if you look up both grants, it lists my postdoctoral advisor as the one the grant was awarded to. My first grant was submitted as a PhD student about to finish and my second grant was submitted as a postdoc. I don't think having an affiliation matters for someone like me - the grant is not given to me so no one would even care if I was working the take out at Burger King when I submitted it. What matters is the person submitting it officially (i.e. my postdoc advisor). My technique wouldn't work obviously if I didn't have a collaborator.","DePaul So just received an email from DePaul (re: Animal Phys position) asking whether still interested in position and to choose a date for an on-campus interview (not even a phone interview first!). Two questions: 1. Anyone heard what happened with the 3 that were originally chosen for interviews? 2. According to the 'Universities to Fear' page, DePaul has been having some issues with the tenure process - high proportion of female faculty have been denied tenure. Anyone have any insight as to how this has affected hiring process and/or the academic climate at DePaul? ",NA,NA,NA,"Some self deprecating (or any other flavor) of humor to keep smiling during the season of job (rejections).

Treatment involves getting on shortlists, and interviews.  Cure is a job. ","I think that there should be a system where if the job candidate is rejected, s/he will get a rejection email. It is better to get a rejection email than wait and find out that someone else got the job. Surely, sending an automated rejection email is not that difficult. 2) Some schools are starting to do this with people who don't make the short list. However, if you make the short list, you are pretty much going to have to wait in case the search fails. But yes, I agree that if you have no shot you should find out immediatley. 3) I tell my non-academic friends that this is the case (no rejection notification) and they are all horrified and don't understand. I don't really understand it either. 4) It is total bullshit. How hard can it be to let people know you're not going to be hiring them?

I say go for that approach and troubleshoot later. 5) I'd say add a column for interviews, the notes will get too long. Also - I'm wondering why the ""find"" function doesn't seem to work - this will be useful to search for jobs and add info on interviews later. 6) OK how about 2 columns, one for job notes, one for search status?

It makes some dismal projections for enrollment/funding/future sustainability of the U of Maine system, and also public education as a whole. Those alt-ac jobs are looking more appealing... 2) Article is behind a paywall, but higher ed is a bubble, and it will burst hard in less than 2 decades. Just hope your life sci. department is in a school that also trains mid-level healthcare providers. 3) I read that article a bit differently - it's certainly a struggle for colleges in esp. rural areas, where high school enrollment and overall population is down. For those school, the situation is not great. However, it also indicates, as other outlets have also, that current and future jobs are more and more requiring a college degree, suggesting that the services university provides are becoming more necessary. I don't doubt that universities will need to change and adapt in ways, but I don't buy the argument that higher ed is a bubble that will burst. This just doesn't jive with the future of employment needs. 4) Well, the thing about bubbles is, they wouldn't burst if people didn't believe they wouldn't burst hahahaha. Education may be the first bubble that you can predict in three charts. Google the following three time series graphs (with up to date data): i) The average debt per borrower in each year's graduating class; ii) college tuition cost CPI (really amazing to find one in comparison to other sectors like housing and energy cost); and iii) the net value of a Bachelor's degree. For a bonus, look at the number of student loan defaults. Can you think of any example of a business enterprise in human history that survived by producing a product of declining value with simultaneous hyperinflation of cost? 5) Universities are not a business enterprise. 6) LOL. Can't. Even.x2 7) #6, could you elaborate? 8) Im not #6, but I think its a bit naive to think Universities arent, essentially, big businesses. They may not be 'for-profit', but plenty of not for profit institutions are massive institutions that people get rich off of. 5) I guess I must be too old school. I wouldn’t call it naïve, but principled. As much as people want to consider themselves high-rollers, I’ve simply never been at a university that _truly_ operated like a business does. I guess all of those who might respond to my comment with “can’t. even” are faculty members at places that do not operate under the mentality that faculty should be free (i.e., protected) to do what they want, or under a framework of shared governance. If you believe in these things at all, then the university does not operate like a business. Maybe my opinion is unpopular, and naïve to some, but many of my faculty colleagues at my R1 would agree with me wholeheartedly. 6) That's nice, but what happens when students are no longer willing or able to pay for an incremental increase in their employability? Are you going to keep being ""principled""? 7) I wouldn't call it naive, but I think it can be hard to see sometimes from within, especially when we hold these places in such high regard. 8) to #6, it seems like you are forgetting the role of state government in funding (or not) public education. If one believes there is public value to public higher education, one could make the case that it's not the universities that are the problem but the state governments that continue to devalue and defund public universities. These systems were not set up to be ""businesses"" that pay for expenses largely from tuition money, despite your claim to the contrary; tuition money was meant to subsidize the government's output. Saying that universities are not providing enough value for the cost of tuition (ie, they are ""a bubble"") is like saying that public libraries are a bubble because late fees won't pay for all the new books they need. That was never the point, and claiming that universities are failing due to those problems is misplacing a large portion of the problem. Universities can do better, probably largely by re-vamping the administrative structures, but that is not why student debt is rising and ""value"" is decreasing. Actual US businesses would be screwed if public universities tanked. x2 5) goo.gl/N8UX9e  :) 9) LOL. Can't. Even. 10) And the state should be paying to keep the number of universities we currently have open despite students not getting enough value out of them because...? No one was suggesting that the students directly fund the university. 11) You can’t teach people that don’t want to learn 12) Oh look, deleting troll is back. 13) Isn't ""value"" defined as what you get for the amount you pay? So if states start funding universities at the levels they were at 15-20 years ago (or more! when the vision for public higher education was a bit different), students then pay less tuition and the ""value"" they receive will directly go up. The argument made by #10 seems... pretty disingenuous and circular. Further, states should do this because it is wildly good for the types of businesses that need employees now and in the future. And businesses should be happy to pay their taxes for this, because of said goodness for them. It's the trying-to-get-something-for-nothing aspect of state funding and business taxes that bugs me.","I wish there was a second notes column called ""venting notes"" on the faculty jobs page for miscellaneous shit-talking and gossip related to the position. Am I the only one who is tempted to make irreverent comments about living in some of these places? 2) Ugh, let's keep the shit-talking quarantined here. x3 3) You sem to be describing the regular notes column on that page x2 4) Tell us your gossip please! 4) As someone who has only interviewed in small towns in deep-red states, I feel the OP. 5) A lot of the deep-red state regional schools should be thought of as leep-frog schools. Use them to get some stability in employment, maximize your effort in research as best you can (especially with student researchers), pick up some lecture experience, and get out as fast as you can. Of coruse, some of them turn out to be rather nice places, and some of us (me) get stuck at them for other reasons. 6) Obviously if someone is unhappy somehwere they should look for employment elsewhere, but saying such schools 'should be thought of' as stepping stones seems deeply problematic and elitist x2. 7) You can say elitist all you want, but no one wants to work at those schools, and when people do get jobs at them, they get out as quick as they can. 8) Just because you don't want to work at them, doesn't mean that noone does... x2 9) I want to second the saying... that was exceptionally elitist and is an attitude that does not promote scientific literacy across the U.S., which is something from which we would all benefit. x4 10) Rich irony of dragging red-state schools while mispelling ""leap-frog"" x 2 11) Richer irony of misspelling misspelling! 12) Perhaps we can all agree on one thing: most of us would be hopelessly (sp?) lost without autocorrect. 13) Even more irony: a comma should always follow an adjective (like ""richer"") when it begins a sentence. Byyyyeeeeeeeeee 14) @12 Speak for youself -County Spelling Bee Champ 15) I've taught at a ""red state"" regional school for years. While I don't necessarily agree with #5's opinion, there is some validity there. The attrition rate at these schools is high, especially junior faculty. Most common reasons for leaving are poor pay and benefits. While #7 (might be #5 again) is not technically correct about no one wanting jobs at ""red state"" regional schools (we do get applicants), our number of applicants is much lower than what you would expect. I live in ""fly-over"" USA and have many friends in biology departments at regionals in my state and those surrounding. It's not uncommon for the applicant pool to be under 20 at our schools for very general position announcements. 16) Man, it bugs me how condescending my colleagues can be. I'm ashamed, but not surprised, to see these comments. If you plan to parachute in to ""use"" some school and its low-class students/faculty, don't be surprised when you wind up ""stuck there."" It is remarkably easy for your students and senior colleagues evaluating you to notice how little you care. 17) Whatever your feelings are, everyone does this. I know three people that took a jobs at unknown and out-of-the-way schools and then got jobs at top-30 SLACs. It is just what you have to do to get a job now. Your outrage might be better directed at the administration that is creating this underpaid and temporary workforce, and not at people just trying to get a job. 18) Just a reminder the unhappy readers that  this is the venting tab, and many of us are dealing with the existential crises of trying to get a job while trying to maintain geographic connections to family, spouses, community, etc., and it is really frustrating. So maybe that leads to venting that looks elitist at first glance, but most of us are hardly elites in any sense of the word, scourging around from one temporary contract to another, moving cities, living like undergrads or grad students in our mid-30s with little financial or any other kind of stability, and at least some of us from pretty humble origins to begin with. So give us a break if we come to the part of the website that's for complaining and complain. x3 19) And some of us are visible ethnic/religious minorities who can't easily live in a rural or homogenous community. It's not elitism to want to feel safe in our permanent job. 20) There is a difference between complaining about the job market and stating that all rural school should be used as temporary springboards. How do you think people who work and are happy at such places would feel about that statement? 21) @19, what a bigoted thing to say that you cant live in a rural community because of your etnicity or religion. My guess is you've never intereacted with anyone from a rural community. 22) @21, are you an ethnic/religious minority living in a rural community? is your kid the only non-white kid at their school? 23) @22, odd, I didnt realize you had to be a different color for certain religions. Or I would simply point out that rural communities are by definition smaller, hence why the perctnage of minorities would be smaller...but even that doesnt matter. Why would you be unable to live in a rural community because of your religion or ethnicity? As I said previously, you've likely never been to a rural community. You likely have never left a city or suburbia. But somehow you think you cant live in a rural area because of your ethnicity or religion. It's bigoted thought. Or are you saying rural communtieis in Alabama and Georgia which are nearly 100% African American are unwelcoming? 24) I currently live in a rural (white) community. Things are fine now, but someday, I would like my daughter to have access to language and religious education not available here or presumably in other small towns. I don't wish to drive 2.5 hours to shop at the ""ethnic"" grocery store. How is that bigoted of me? 25) Those reasons (education, shopping, etc.) are economic and have nothing to do with feeling ""safe"" as 19 originally pointed out. If you dont want to live inb Seattle because of the rain or AZ because of the heat, those are classifiable. Asserting that you cant live in a rural community because it's ""unsafe"" (lol, the stats show that is patently absurd), or ""white"" (lol, rural communtiies come in all different flavors) is bigoted. Deciding a group of people are unsafe and white because of where they live is wrong. Rural is a location, not an ethnicity, or a religion. I know i grew up in a rural community that was neither white, nor unsafe. But you be you. 26) brown person here jumping into the convo. I'm a brown woman living in a very white very rural community, which is also very safe. Here's my experience: the questioning is unbearable, as well as the staring when I go to the supermarket or the gym... people are constantly interrumpting me when I'm speaking by the phone (not in english) to ask me what am I doing in x place. They've also interrumpted me when I'm having dinner with my one other non-white friend or my husband and speaking in another language because people, I assume, are curious? Questions are sometimes friendly, some other times I'm not sure. Needless to say, sometimes I'm afraid. I can't wait to get out of here.  27) have to say 23 and 25 are making a good point. I also think people might conflate being genuinely afraid vs being uncomfortable. Stastically we should all be most afraid of riding in a car, contracting heart disease, or somehow aquiring an opioid addiction.  But how many of us are thinking about that when forming our geographic preferences? 28) racism is something to be afraid of and it's something that I think about when forming my geographic preferences 29) I'm more worried about my kids getting bullied at school for their color. Most adults don't overtly act racist, but kids will pick on kids that are different. So for that reason I tend to not apply to certain locations. Also, @23, I think it's very different for a minority person (say brown or asian) to move to a 100% African American town than a 100% white town. Not to be reverse-racist, and I'm sure it depends on the part of the country, but I think the African American town would be more welcoming. x2 30) Wow @27, are you really telling people what they should be afraid of? 31) Seems about par for the course here 32) TL;DR: non-white people don't feel as welcome in rural areas and white people are surprised 33) @32, again why do people from cities with no travel experience think rural = white? 34) @33, in the US, it is pretty safe to assume that rural communities are going to be mostly white. Of course there will be exceptions, but I don't think it is much of a stretch to say that rural=mostly white. 35) I'll go a step further and say that many rural places with colleges are primarily white, due do historic inequities.  Tribal colleges and HBCUs are the exception, not the rule. 36) It is not ""safe to assume"" that rural communities mean mostly white. Kansas and Alabama are not the same. Let's not prejudge communities. 37) If anyone noticed the brief few minutes this was erased, that was my bad, hit wrong button, un-did, no reflection on what was written here. 38) @33, 32 made no assumptions about the racial-ethnic makeup of rural communities in their comment x3",asking search committee if youre in the running? ,"OMFG if the application says to submit a document containing X and you submit an otherwise great app without X we cannot push for you to get an interview.  No matter how good your papers are.  Please for heavens sake include the docs you are asked for. 2) OMFG, just ask the applicant for the missing document . Applicants are filling applying for hundreds of positions each with their own particular documents and HR portals. x6 3) So now it's the committee's job to make sure the applicants don't screw up? x2 4) In this cycle, I accidentally messed up an application submission bc the portal was unusual, but also the portal wouldn't let me correct it. When I called HR about getting the right documents in before the deadline, they had me email them to some generic employment address, but I never got any kind of confirmation that they were received or anything like that. I assume they made it, but maybe not? The point is that the process is so opaque that even well meaning applicants screw up, try to fix it, and STILL have no idea whether the error was corrected. 4) same just happened to me 5) just don't engage with this person #3 again) you can choose not to engage with me, that's fine. But the fact is that committee members have 100+ applications to read and we do not have the time to be reaching out to everyone who did not provide a complete application. If the situtation is like #4 said, then I would email the committe chair to ask whether it'd be ok to send updated materials--I presume that most people would say yes to that, especially that we know HR is often useless in those cases. There is a difference between someone who made a mistake and wants to proactively fix it and someone who just didn't care to follow the directions. x2 6) Give me a break 3, you said this was a person who otherwise would have been near the top of the list. Surely it wouldn't be that hard to reach out to applicants in that case for a job that might play a major role in your department for the next 30+ years. This is a board for people seeking jobs who are all stressed out about the uncertainty of their careers and are getting underpaid in temporary positions. Someone in a permanent job coming on here to 'vent' about how those people aren't trying hard or carefully enough is just being a jerk. x11   7) Telling some candidates to redo application materials is not consistent with fair hiring practices.  It's a good way to get a search cancelled. x3 8) Telling someone to redo a document seems different than an alert that a key piece is missing.  9) My HR won't send us non-complete applications, so we wouldn't even know you applied if you left something out. x3 10) Posting this is incredibly unprofessional. X2 12) What about this is unprofessional? No one was named. I'm not the OP, but applicants should know that their applications will probably ""fall through the cracks"" if they don't fulfill the application requirements. And search committees might not have the time and there might be HR issues that prevent the committee from seeking to make those applications complete.  1) The tone was unprofessional, very sorry for that.  It was definitely meant as 11 interpeted it.  There will probably be someone frustrated they can't push for you to get an interview if you completely disregard instructions in the request for applications.  We cannot help you without risking a failed search over legal issues. 12) <- find somewhere else to vent. If you have constructive advice for job seekers who are stressed out, overworked, and sometimes truly hopeless, do it in a constructive way. I appreciate that you acknowledge it was inappropriate, so why not just delete it and offer some kind advice in another format? x5 13) This is a venting page. I find it constructive to know what search committees are venting about! x9 14) And I thought the venting page was off to a slow start...x2 :) x2 14) Props to OP for apologizing and editing their vent. I think they raise a good point (although maybe General Discussion would've been a better place to post it in this more-neutral way). 15) It wouldn't be the venting page if people weren't venting about how they don't like all the venting that goes on here. 16) Is there a teenager on this search committee? 17) @16: of course there is. 18) This makes me sad. 19) It would also be nice if people didn't write ambiguous job ads.  I'm going to read the ad differently if it says ""Applications close on X"" than ""Review will begin on X"", and if I'm brain dead from grading student work I may well guess in the latter case that it would be better to sleep and submit the following day so that I don't make a stupid mistake in editing my documents.  In the former case, I'm going to submit even if I'm editing while half asleep, because that's the only chance I'll have. 19) Search chair here (not OP).  Depending on HR policy, the search chair/committee often is not allowed contact candidates.  And packets often CANNOT be modified after close.  At my institution, we are not allowed to review incomplete applicaitons (it is the first box on the rubric).  Please make sure to get all of your materials in.  If you are confused, ask.  The chair generally can respond to specific questions (I submitted X, Y and Z, please let me know if you need anything else from me).  It is your responsibility to get materials in, not the responsibility of the search committee, chair or HR to contact you.  +1 20) Ok boomer.21) And it is the responsibility of the SC, HR, et alia to have a smooth, consistent, sensible, accessible, coherent, and functioning application portal and general process. 22) @20 and others - so do you contact each of your students individually if they fail to submit a homework assignment and allow them the chance to submit it even though the deadlines appear somewhere in their syllabus or online and you probably also reminded them in class? Yeah, I thought so. Give the committee a break. It's YOUR job to submit the appropriate materials in the manner requested and to ask for clarification when directions are unclear - unlike your relationship with your students, a search committee has NO obligation to make sure you follow the directions specified in the job ad and to chase applicants around for any missing information they requested 23) @22 - so do you regularly ask your students to blindly submit hundreds of seperate assignments that will be rejected without grading if they don't adhere to arcane formatting rules that include co-submissions from other people where the status can't be checked without tracking down each of those people individually to verify that they submitted? You must be a great teacher. Lots of universities/departments have HR and submission site systems that work fine: they don't require letters up front, you can see the status of each document from the applicant's side, they don't specify their own 'take' on job documents that force complete reformatting of materials for one job. If you ensure that your search is using one of those systems, it should not be any extra work to make sure that the process works like 21 describes above. In short: don't blame applicants in tenuous career positions for your own crappy hiring practices.","VAP negotiations I received a nice salary offer on a one-year VAP. Should I ask for a higher salary or focus on negotiating a few smaller perks. I'm think about things that were discussed in the interview process but not formally included in the offer, ex: funding to bring students to conferences, a T/W/Th teaching schedule, support to bring students on field trips? 2) I would recommend negotiating a higher salary - it is standard practice. If you want to be conservative, just ask for $5,000 more and meet them in the middle. I don't think this interferes with separate requests, such as lab startup funds, or in your case, support to bring students to field trips or conferences. 3) FWIW, my experience has been that VAPs are rather inflexible. You might get a (very little) bit of research money or some moving expenses, but I've been in 2 visiting positions and never successfully moved my salary offer. 4) Salary did not change, other requests were met."

(2) Haven't heard anything either (so that's three of us)

(5) When I submitted my online application it gave me a message to the effect of ""the funding has been suspended for this position, we will let you know if we get it back"" (6) I got the same message, but figured it was generated because of last year (when the same position was advertised and cancelled due to budget shortfalls). Oh, I spoke to the dept. head that week, and there was no indication that the position was up in the air.
(7)  When I applied, the message was:  ""Due to recent cost containment measures at the College, each vacancy is currently being reviewed on a case-by-case basis to determine continuation in the search process. We will continue to accept applications and will notify you when, and if, a decision to proceed on this position has been completed. During this time, we ask your patience."" (8) I have no patience.

I made a few key, but pretty minor changes (including changing a letter writer), and the next fall had 3 interviews and landed the dream job.

It would be interesting to see whether this makes a difference or whether SCs count acadmic age only from PhD graduation.","Why are comments constantly being deleted everywhere on here?

There are two positions on here that are flagged as ""inside hires"" where I know for certain this is not the case.  In addition, if there is an ""inside person"" who is qualified, there is a really good chance that person will not get the job in the end as the committee/department evaluates candidates. x2 2) Inside candidate here, I kind of think the bar is actually higher for us. x2 3) #2 - I think in many cases, this may be true.  Not to say that there are simply unfair hiring practices out there, but most committees really try to do a thorough job evaluating candidates 4) All good points so far, I'd just add that a good way to think about it is that inside candidates have some clear advantages (understanding the department and it's needs and personalities intimately, knowing who else is interviewing, and sometimes, having a mole on the committee), but also some clear disadvantages (committees/dept. heads/deans often don't want to hire inside candidates, it's hard to hide any weaknesses, and it's hard to bring something new and exciting when everyone already knows what you do) x3 5) #4 - spot on.  Also keep in mind that the committee expects an inside candidate to have the needs ""dialed in"".  An outside candidate can compete here by doing their homework. 6) I have no problem with ""inside hires"". You can be an inside hire too. 7) Broader context: commenters on ecoevojobs.net absolutely suck at identifying positions that might or will make ""inside"" hires; they're almost invariably wrong. In part because only a tiny fraction of all positions get filled by ""inside"" candidates. See here: https://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2017/09/23/hardly-any-ecology-faculty-positions-are-filled-by-internal-candidates-and-you-cant-reliably-identify-the-ones-that-will-be/ x3 8) I think this is an inside post.   9)  I'm going to assume the OP is an inside hire.  :P 10) Seems kinda pointless to hate on the inside candidate when there's so much more fertile ground to hate on the dean, the state legislatures, or all the other factors that cause you to not get hired. x2 11) I think the hate for internal candidates is that they break the illusion of meritocracy on which sceince operates. Unfortunately academic science is just as nepotic and exclusionary as any other human endeavour; fortunately, it's also savage and brutal so if you're demonstrably better than the internal you can cause a bunch of issues for the department by screwing up their vote. x3 12) No one will complain about internal candidate if they themesleves are an internal candidate. 13) In general, issues arise when somebody on the hiring side makes decisions based on their assumptions about the candidates' suitability before or despite putting them all through a standardized interview process. Issues like this are more likely when an internal candidate is part of the mix, specifically because internal is seen as a known entity - this often is not favorable to internal candidate. There is on average less excitement to recruit somebody who is already there, from both faculty and administration. @11, I agree with only some of your statement. There is no reason to equate an internal hire with nepotism. Even spouses may easily be percieved as candidates who just don't fit in for some reason or another.","Here's a nightmare twitter thread I fell down today:2) “We’re really just looking for someone who looks good in a skirt.” - Yikes   3) My friend Ian looks great in a skirt. M 4) I may or my not be that Ian, but thanks anyway!","Resources for developing your diversity plan I've read the thread below on diversity statements, but still feel unprepared when asked about concrete measures to plan on implementing for diverse student groups (or particularly one group highly represented in a particular student body). Does anyone have suggestion for references on this? 2) ive never read one that was more than an empty sheet of paper, sorry cant help you. its pretty messed up that departments think a junior academic has any chance of moving the needle on a systemic issue like diversity x4 3) Just make sure to include these words  https://emberin.com/diversity-inclusion-buzzwords-2018/  and take these ones out because they are old  https://emberin.com/diversity-inclusion-buzzwords-2017/  4) This was sort of brought up in the thread below, but I wonder how much search committees even care about what goes into these statements. I suspect some really do care, while in other searches these statements are required on application simply to please University admin, and are barely read. 5) I do think you can tank your chances by having a truly bad statement, but I suspect you have to already be very competitive everywhere else for a good statement to make much difference. 6) As someone who has served on a number of hiring committees, I agree with 5. We don't require divesity statements, but it's much like a teaching statement: most are fairly generic,and a few will be impressive by showing they have specific experience with effective methods, but mostly it's a way to shoot yourself in the foot if you write a bad one (show you don't actually care all that much about teaching/diversity) 7) It depends on the school: some colleges/universities/departments are highly committed and serious about inclusivity, while others are not. There are probably more that don't care, but some that really care a lot. Either way, it is our role to think critically about these issues and take it seriously, whether others care or not. x3 8) Because inequity is systemic, the only way to move the needle is to reward and hire people who are willing to put in the work to produce more equitable outcomes in science. The more junior faculty that are hired who care about this, the more hiring committees will be composed of people who care. 9) Yes we all know that's the argument people make when they force pre-faculty people to write those statements. How about instead of requiring powerless people to say they care about diversity (which they're all going to do in a diversity statement) you have the hiring committee members write diversity statements? 10) What's most challenging about these is that as graduate students and post-docs, promoting diversity is not something we are ever expected or encouraged to focus our time on. We recieve no training in it, and are not given outlets for doing so beyond the classroom. So, it is difficult for many of us to give examples of steps we have taken to foster diversity that don't sound cliche. If schools are truly interested in diversity and equity, they should have programs or expectations in place for new faculty after they are hired. They should provide training on inclusive pedagogies, and explicitly incorporate diversity efforts into tenure decisions, etc. But, I don't think this is common at all, and my view is that departments ask for these diversity statements because they involve zero effort on their part, yet make it look like they care about these issues. x3 1) Thank you all for your comments! I think departments should discuss this topic with grad students more since they are expecting their new hires to at least act like they know something about it. 11) I have a slightly different perspective than #10.  While my advisor and department don't value it especially, outreach has been encouraged in my graduate career, and I will seek it out in my postdoc because it is so important to me.  Since there are no immediate benefits, I think that having strong diversity statement for the hiring process is the ultimate reward! 12) I honestly don't know how to respond to people who think there are ""no immediate benefits"" to working towards having a more inclusive system in ecology and evolution. Yes, part of the problem is that graduate students are not - by and large - encouraged to focus on promoting diversity or equity. That's a problem in itself, but if current graduate students pushed for it, then it would happen more often. There are certainly large universities that already include inclusive pedagogy as part of their training for TAs. Here's an example: do you pay your field technicians and advertise broadly? If so, you're promoting equity in the field because not everybody can afford to take on an unpaid internship, and you're giving opportunities for everyone to apply, not just people well connected in your lab. That's a minor thing graduate students can do that you can (and should) include in your statement on promoting diversity and inclusion. Your ability to recognize those actions as being connected to equitable outcomes is the kind of thing that faculty who read diversity statements (and care about them) are looking for. Not so much huge, world-changing things, but evidence that you're well-read on the subject and understand how smaller actions build into larger outcomes. Evidence that you're actually thinking about this stuff. On the hiring committees I've been on, we tend to group people into three categories based on their diversity statements: ""clearly doesn't care and probably wouldn't engage with the training we do offer new faculty,"" ""clearly cares enough to benefit from growth once they got here"" and ""has one or more clear ways that they've substantially contributed to diversity."" I think more and more we're not going to consider the first category of people for hiring. 13) 1@12:  11 here.  I meant that there were no immediate benefits to me (no pay or recognition for my time and efforts, less time for research).  Obviously I think there are immediate benefits to others and the field in general, which is why I do it. 14) What are the quantified outcomes of this diversity training? 15) Reduction in achievement gaps for under-represented students 15) How is that achieved? 16) Through the use of pedagogical approaches demonstrated by empirical research to improve retention, understanding and a sense of inclusion and reduce stereotype threat. 17) Seems like good training. I really wish that in any of my 30 years of school, somone taught me some, or really any of the things I am asked to have extensive knowledge of (including diversity issues and best practices) in applications, or interviews.","I was invited for an interview against others with multiple Nature/Science/PNAS papers. I don't have any of these super high impact pubs, and am having a hard time with morale--I feel that I have no shot at this. Don't look at the seminar schedule where you're interviewing. 2) I've been told if you make it to an on-site, you have as good a chance as anyone else (they've already decided you would be hireable, assuming you're not a jerk at the interview). You never know if those competitors are going to wind up with offers elsewhere anyway. Prepare and be as confident as you can - you are worthy. 2.1) Too positive for the Venting tab? 3) When I was picked up at the airport for an interview once, the search chair told me that if I didn't get the job, it wasn't personal and in no way an opinion of me as a person or my research. It would be purely political and an outcome of voting and political alliances. Weird way to greet one I thought. But it became clear later as I didn't get the job. Politics in the place were a bit weird.  Evidently they were enamored with another candidate who interviewed before me. This other person had higher impact pubs than me. Notably, this person also interviewed at another place and blew her/his chances because s/he flaunted her/his high impact papers at every opportunity. Evidently what works at one place doesn't at others. Maybe this is helpful. 4) Cheer up OP -- you landed one on-site interview so you must be doing lots of things right.  You can land more interviews, and one day all the uncontrollable factors will line up in your favor.  Keep at it! 5) I agree with #2- once you've made it to the interview stage, it's more about how you interact and present rather than how you look on paper. In person, enthusiasm, good ideas, and clear communication will always win over high impact pubs. 6) Agree with many above (you've made this far and the interview become the biggest piece). Plus maybe they're TOO good and will take offers elsewhere. 7) I was told that I was the 4th choice among the four candidates that interviewed (for fit reasons). But I got the job because the other 3 turned it down! OP) Thanks y'all. These anecdotes help put it into perspective: it's out of my hands, aside from working hard on a good interview 7) Also, they could have stacked the deck in the PNAS candidates favor so they could try and get more salary and startup from the dean by pointing out how extraordinary they are by comparison 8) There is nothing inherently special about PNAS given that editors can be prearranged, NAS coauthors can contribute papers, and papers need to pique NAS members' sometimes-narrow interests to even be considered. It's way more of a crapshoot that people think. 9) Didn't that system change? x2 10) I don't think so? 11) I don't think you can prearrange editors at PNAS, unless maybe a NAS member is one of the co-authors. In my experience, you can only request the ones you want (just like any other journal) but are not guaranteed to get them. 12) PNAS used to have a separate review track where NAS members could 'communicate' up to two papers per year and avoid a lot of the normal peer-review process by picking reviewers, etc. That path was ended a while ago though. My understanding is that this crazy (but highly entertaining!!) paper played a major role in ending the practice: https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2009/08/25/0908357106 13)  What did I just read/skim?! 14) They do still have a direct path for NAS members but it is more selective now: https://www.pnas.org/page/authors/journal-policies 15) @12 thanks for sharing, that's hillarious! is there somewhere to read more discussion of that paper? 12) It got an immediate rebuttal. I was in grad school when it happened and one of the rebutters was a prof in my department. Pretty crazy that they had to take it seriously enough to actually refute it: https://www.pnas.org/content/106/47/19906.short (and I love their title for the rebuttal). Notice that the first paper was communicated by Lynn Margulis who championed a number of very controversial ideas late in her career: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynn_Margulis#Controversies @12 Wtf?? and thanks for sharing. now how do I get on the crazy train to PNAS publication and ... (???) ... success? 12) Unfortunately for us job seekers. I think the way this works is you have a long successful career THEN you get to publish your crazy PNAS papers. 13) Or your advisor is in the NAS. 14) Advisor is in NAS, and can confirm it has NO bearing on getting published in PNAS 15) Then you're not pestering them hard enough to contribute your papers there! 16) as a counterpoint, my Postdoc PI is not a NAS member (brand new, not at a ""fancy school""), and I managed to get one in with just him and I on it - guess we managed to get the right editor and reviewers. Was a real shock 17) cool x2","Second Visit (Trying again) Ok trying this again since last time the sheet just autoput another response in this box. How common are second visits at non-R1 schools? How should one go about asking for a second visit after being offered a position? It would be nice to go and find potential places to live, as well as talk to faculty more candidly about life there. 1) this is certainly not out of the question.  In my department it happens occasionally but not every time - second visits for house-hunting usually happen after the position has been accepted.  An admin should have no problem forking out a few hundred more dollars to make sure the candidate will be happy and to increase the likelihood of an accepted offer.  Even if the candidate declines after the second visit, it is saving tons of start-up dollars on someone who may be unhappy and likely to move. 2) I've been wondering this as well. I received an offer but wouldn't mind a second visit to have a better look at neighborhoods, etc.  3) 1 again - ask for sure - start with the dept. chair - an offer means you were highly regarded and having the chair on your side when going to the dean for more money can't hurt. 4) I've had second postdoc-hire visits. In general, if there is a a good reason to need a second visit to decide (talk to additional faculty, get a sense of location) you should ask for it."

In this economic climate, I would expect things to be much tighter. 5) OP here, thanks a lot!  6)  I work at an M.S. granting publicly funded university in TX and we were offering $25K about 6-7 years ago and have gotten it up to around $50K in the last few years.  I had applied at a similarly sized school in TN about 7 years ago and they offered zero in start-up, so I think the numbers are pretty variable.  I would say the best estimate would be to expect at least $20K-$25K and if you get more, be happy.",Anyone know if there's a wiki that posts job openings at independent coffee shops?

Has anyone else?  Nope but check the details of the coverage. I would say insurance from state universities should be pretty good, though I'd read the fine print for smaller colleges and universities. 3) My understanding is that before the ACA, people with pre-existing conditions could enroll, but often pay higher rates, and those conditions may not be covered or may not be covered until after a waiting period. Details of coverage right now still reflect the protections of the ACA, but changes could be made in coming months. It seems like someone accepting a position now can't know what the details of coverage would be by the time they start and enroll in a health care program.4) #2 here, I started working for a major university in a large state before the ACA and there was no pre-existing condtion exclusion at all. From our perspective, very little changed as a result of the ACA regarding base coverage, only some  'perks' (birth control and pregnancy related areas) that are of course not insignificant but will not bankrupt us if they go away. So, if possible you may want to cruise the web for benefits pre-ACA. 5) Please try not to call critical women's health care 'perks'. And if you think pregnancy and childbirth are not major costs you are very naive. 6) 4 here again. Umm. Thanks for the knee jerk response. Reread the post - women's health was not trivialized, rather the point was that we weren't going to go bankrupt pre-ACA because our plan was pretty good in the first place. We have had kids before and after the ACA, while the expenses aren't insignificant, we were lucky because our university health insurance in most areas changed very little as a result of the ACA. The point was that some health plans will not necessarily get significantly worse when/if the ACA is repealed because state universities are large and often incorporate people from numerous campuses and even other state agencies. I would expect that plans that will suffer the most under ACA repeal are individual plans. 7) It is not a knee-jerk response. I understood your point, and I agree up to a point. The ACA provided 'perks' like covering your teenager's reproductive health. My previous medical plan (from a univiersity) would cover viagra and not birth control for a teenage girl. When you use terms like 'perks' for women's reproductive health, that is part of the cultural problem that has led to our country defunding and devaluing women's health care.  8)  Oh, good grief, don't you have some place to march to #5? 9) Hey everyone, could we not let this become the next ""emails on Xmas"" thread? Everyone's stressed out with work and politics as it is, no need to rile up people who should be your allies. 10) someone should have explained that to Bernie Sanders  11)  You mean someone should have explained that to the DNC? 12) No. Sanders. Third party candidates almost always hand the election to someone else - not any different with Sanders, Stein, Johnson, Nader, etc. Anyway. 12) Can we please leave political debates to another venue and return to the topic at hand? x3 13) You are right #8, I should be marching. Thanks for reminding me. ","Should I be surprised that all video interviewers are from the same gender? That sends a negative message to me..... 2) Not surprised. All the places I've interacted with had at least one woman on the panel. 3) It doesn't happen often. If it happens that none of the female faculty can attend certain event, then just accept it, and hope that there will be more female faculty in that department in the future. On a relavant note, there are on average less than 20% female faculty. If we expect that female faculty always representated in administrave activities, this will have negative impact to those female professors. 3) Panels sometimes include support staff, teaching faculty, etc. I'm not buiying the idea that they couldn't find any women to involve in the process.  4) In 5 years of job hunting, I've never once seen a phone interview include support staff. 5) I have. They were presumably making an effort to have multiple women present. 6) #3 again, I am not talking about a scenario that no female faculty involves in faculty search, but saying that no female faculty in one candidate's video interview, and I don't think the OP need to interpret it in a particularly negative way.  7) the OP could mean that all the video interviewers are female, but everyone assumed that they are all male. 8) We're Bayesians like that. Number of times I've seen a search committee with more women than men == 0. Ideally, there should be an even split, however. 8) OP here. I tried to be neutral in my original question, but the sad fact is all the interviewers are male. I know there are many possible reasons why female SC could not attend the video interview. I was just really surprised as this is the first time I ever experienced this. For my past video interviews, there were always > 30% female faculties. 9) So that does suck, and I understand how you feel. I am the only one of my gender in my huge lab and I will be honest, it is weird and there is an inescapable gender bias in us all. To the larger point, PhDs are awarded mostly to men in ecology, and on average, women are actually overrepresented as faculty in ecology departments based on the number of ecology PhDs (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ecs2.2031/full). As always, the best person should get the job, and interviewing with a bunch of people with the opposite gender (id) is hard, even though it shouldnt be, it also shouldn’t be very surprising (or encouraging given everything we know about gender bias [good refs in that article]). Good luck! 10) #9, your remark that PhDs in ecology are awarded ""mostly to men"" is well out of date. As of 2013, women comprised 52% of post-2000 US PhD recipients in ecology according to the data in the Hampton & Labou 2017 Ecosphere paper you linked to. 9) I don’t recall ’my remark’ having a date. From the paper: ‘The gender breakdown for all ecology Ph.D. graduates since 1968 was 37.2% female and 62.8% male.’ That means, more men have been awarded ecology PhDs than women. Also, you didnt get the info you cite completely correct: the stat your are trying to quote actually is using data from 2000 onward, not ‘as of 2013.’ Barba non facit philosophum. 11) I don't need to quote Latin to demonstrate that the proportion of men receiving PhDs in 1969 is utterly irrelevant to whether women are disproporionately hired as assistant professors in 2018. To cite the proportion of men receiving PhDs in 1969 as evidence that women are overrepresented is the single worst argument I've seen on this wiki yet, and that's saying something. 9) Well, you may wish to rebut the authors in the journal, because they did the analysis, not me. Also, it isnt an argument, but a statement of fact with no judgement one way or another. You assigned your own judgement to it because you are angry, and that is part of the reason civil discussion of science is rare in America. And again, had you actualy read what I wrote (or the actual paper), you would know that it is not the number of PhDs granted in 1969, but SINCE 1968 (the mathematical function called cumulative). Your anger has clouded your comprehesion of facts. I will leave a quote from John Adams so you don’t have to ‘quote latin’: ‘Facts are stubborn things; and whatever may be our wishes, our inclinations, or the dictates of our passions, they cannot alter the state of facts and evidence.’ It is not clear to me whether people are trolling this page or just so willfully ignorant. In either case I won’t respond again, so feel free to misrepresent what I wrote all you like. 10) <- you're hilarious (I'm not angry, I'm genuinely laughing). You think noting that it is cumulative makes including numbers from a half century ago relevant to today's job market.  12) Perhaps not relevant to the job market in terms of the pool of applicants, but probably relevant in terms of the decisions being made by search committees/departments. FWIW, I'm on a SC now, for a job on this wiki, and fewer than 25% of the applicants were female. 13) So 10 my Ph.D. advisor got his degree in 1957, and he is still on searches. 14) Plus the whole cumulative thing.... 10) I understand there's a discrimination hangover that makes it more likely that older faculty skew toward men. To say that women are overrepresented in ecology is disingenous, my only point. Would anyone argue they are overrepresented in non-TT appointments and underrepresented in positions of power and tenure? If 50% of new hires in the past five years were women, but women were less than 50% over the past 50 years, that would not make them overrepresented. Guys get extremely defensive about this issue the second there's a perception things might favor women. And for women on the job market, seeing a panel of all old guys can send a message that has real effects.  15) Are you a guy? Because you seem to be the one getting defensive. Saying something is overrepresented isnt saying it is right. You could take a grab sample of a lake and only get  Wolffia. That sample is overrepresentive of Wolffia in  the entire lake. I agree with 9 that it just a statement of facts, and you are the person making it into an argument. 16) I still think you should read the paper, because what overrepresented means is in terms of the number of phds granted, not the number of new hires or whatever you are thinking. Also, I think it was said that the best person should get the job? Can we not discuss simple numbers? 17) I’m sorry, “Guys get extremely defensive about this issue”? Wow. Stereotype much? Unbelievable. 18) My anecdata are consistent with bros getting defensive. Have you any idea how often women are told things will be easy for them due to political correctness, and how often male faculty will think the makeup of the department is fine when several fields have no women? 19) Are you arguing that anecdotal experiences are an excuse to stereotype by gender?  20) Ha, have you ever been on Twitter? #yesallmen There's also literature consistent with people not believing bias doesn't exist when it doesn't affect them. 19) https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whataboutism  21) Someone characterizing men as ""bros"" on a professional forum.  We've found the sexist. 22) No, dear. Some men. Mostly white cishet ones.  23) Love that sexist condescension, #22. Glad to see that you're spicing it up with racist and gender/sexuality-based derision too. /s 24) Racism against white people isn't a thing. 25) Hey 17, way to shoot yourself in the foot there. x2 26) Way to x2 your own post. Also, nobody knows what you are talking about 27) I didn't. ","negotiations tab cost of living classifications On the negotiations tab, people list their salaries as well as cost of living in the area where the job is located. Cost of living is qualified by ""low"" ""mid"" ""high"" ... Curious what people consider quantitative ranges to be for Low/Mid/High living costs. Living in the southeast for a while, moving to a city with 1b/1b rent of >$500/mo was ""mid"" to me, but now I'd kill to have 1/1 rent <$1000. Would be helpful when considering negotiations and salary ranges to have a better sense of what Unis are paying in these different regions and L/M/H locations within said regions. 3) Based on salary scales, high in that tab seem to mean 1/1 rent >1500 or even 2000. Living cost in many places of east and west coasts are suprisingly high. 4) Someone posted a ""high"" cost of living for a school in the south... where is that unicorn place? 5) Charleston? Chapel Hill? They are pricey. 6) HAHA not compared to NYC/Boston...7) Miami is among the highest places in the south - not NYC, but right around the cost of Portland OR, Philadelphia, or San Diego, which are pretty high cost-of-living cities. I don't think anyone would argue with calling San Diego high cost of living. 8) @7, same with DC area, which some would classify as the south 9) @8 no one from the south is calling DC ""the south""... but I get your point :) 10) @9, ha, true, but using that cultural definition of ""the south"" that seems to have developed, a lot of university towns in the regional south aren't really considered ""the south"" by those same people...",NA,Things I learned between seasons ,"So few jobs at the full professor level.  How do people even move after tenure?  Any other senior faculty lurking here? 2) I've come to the conclusion that moving after tenure is very difficult. I've been trying to do it for 10 years. I get interviews, but nothing ever lands. I think the administrative route might be the best bet. Unfortunately, I have no desire to be an administrator. x2 OP) Me neither! 3) there's this aspect of academia where faculty in a department are all about their power structures; bringing in an assistant professor is ok because they can be manipulated, converted, twisted into their liking and the new faculty will go along with it because they need a job. A senior person coming in with tenure with a large startup package threatens that. It's stupid really. I don't want to move because I want to mess up your little party, rather I'd like to be more successful/happier at my job. OP) @3 I'm glad to not be in such a toxic department!  Another dynamic working against senior faculty getting hired is that faculty can project their hopes & dreams on a new asst. prof.  With a full prof, what you see is what you get. 4) Yes and no. I've seen some departments recruit senior faculty and benefit from it, it is possible to flourish at all ages.  5) I've seen quite a few profs move at tenure, but I have no idea how the new positions were discovered ... 6) There have been a good number of ""Asst / Assoc Prof"" jobs this year.  Sucks to be full though. * still thankful to have a tenured job and wish all the postdocs here the best. 7) These jobs may not be getting posted as frequently as asst. prof jobs. Also, lots of these calls are circulated via email or are semi-targeted from a pool of candidates who have already expressed interest. Often a very different process than typical searches. 8) I'm not yet full, only assoc., but I've been applying for a fair number of asst. positions. I wouldn't mind a move backwards if it would get me out of this place! 9) The best part about toxic departments is that they don't know they are toxic. Mainly b/c they aren't toxic to the old folks. 10) To be fair, theres very few jobs at the assistant prof. level in the field of general ecology. Crummy year all around, it seems. 11) And general evolution 12) Or anything in evolution 13) I'm seeing lots of ""data science"" this year, but I'm not convinced they're not just using it as a buzzword. 14) They are  15) ""data science"" is probably how they convinced the admins to give them a position that fits an NSF buzzword.   They will still probably hire whatever biologist they always wanted.   16) We have an open rank search this year.  The real challenge is figuring out which Associate and Fulls want to move instead of just getting a raise at their current institution.  Putting word out with friends or at conferences will help make the case that you really are serious about applications.   Don't harp on about how bad your school is if you get an interview or try to convince them your colleagues are evil.   But don't be afraid to say a few direct sentences that you want to leave and have good reason for doing so.  Often times though full professor hires start with back-door conversations and then schools create opportunity hires. 17) I alway suspected the back door had something to do with an ap leaving my department overnight","Reposted on Chronical Vitae => Still Accepting Apps? When a job gets reposted on Chronicle Vitae, after the deadline has passed, does it mean the committee is still soliciting applications? 2) Generally, yes.

Are those of us who didn't make the short list not worthy of the attention of the majestic people who have jobs? I'm not talking about a search with 700 applicants here.   (1) I think some places wait until the last second to send these out--after an offer is accepted. By then, it's a complete waste of time, because, duh, you know you didn't get the job. (2) This is sometime not even a decision by the search committee, it is the policy of some Colleges. Keeps the line open in case of a failed search.

I am a postdoc on the job market at an R1 working on some really exciting stuff. I have solid pubs (>15) in very respectable journals, and a decent funding record. No Nature, or Science pubs, but working on that. Anyway, I don't have a lot of success getting interviews. You see, here is some background. I am not American - I am from Asia. Due to various circumstances, and despite my best efforts, I HAD to  go to grad school at a tier 2 university, but with a great department and some accomplished people. I did a terrific job while there, and am very successful. Even got funded, and published well. But due to the lukewarm response I get towards my job applications, I am beginning to fear that the first line on my CV listing my PhD granting institution is turning people away from taking me seriously. I hope I am wrong. I want it to be wrong. But looking at some comments on this and other sites, and having heard of attitudes of search committes regarding applicants from anything less than the best schools, a terrible fear is growing inside me.  I am darn good at what I do and I feel that any decent department would be lucky to hire me (my referees think so).  But if I am not making it past the first screen due to my academic pedigree, what chance do I have in getting noticed - terrific CV or not? Any thoughts and similar experiences?` 1) When you say that you are not making it past the first screen, do you mean you're  not getting phone interviews?  How many apps have you sent out, and how many phone interviews have you gotten? 2) OP here. In the two years on the market now, I have applied to 54 position, resulting in two phone interviews. One of those led to a campus interview last year. 2) DO you have a permanent visa?  IF so, you must make sure this is up front known.  DO you have teaching experience?  DO you have studetn evals?  You don't need Science and Nature and you definitely don't need to be concerned about your tier.  THat is all mumbo jumbo.  In fact, tier 2 graduates often do much better than tier 1 because they are more used to dealing with adversity and making due with what they have instead of having almost limitless resources.  They are also used to making their own way without the benefit joint authored papers that amount to cram everyone's name on it who is in the lab, nor are they funneled into positions via unethical but regular practices of inflating citation records by having every grad from the lab cite soon-to-graduate's papers.  In other words, if a person comes out of a tier 1 and they have 1 paper or 10 papers, we know they wrote them, if they have 15 citations on one, we know they were earned.  WHen an R1 comes out, its impossible to be sure.  Many more R1 grads get jobs than tier 2 simply because their are many more R1 grads in the first place.  Meanwhile, there are also many more tier 1 graduates who flop than tier 2 grads, and that is true on both a numerical and a percentage basis.  The thing is, you don't have the benefit of the unethical masking of your abilities that many from tier 1s enjoy.  But be assured, those in the know will recognize you are damn good if you have the teaching and research credentials.  Never feel inferior to a tier 1 grad.  I have several associates who graduated from tier 2 and they are currently tenured professor priemeir R1s. Also, a few of your priemeir biologists came out of programs that are now considered priemeir, but barely qualified as tier 1 when the graduated.  Those grads defined the program from which they graduated.  You are the product, not your school.  YOu just need to sell yourself properly. 3) I put a post here but it disappeared.  Basically 54 applications and two phone interviews isn't bad.  That's my experience and others on the market I know.  We're from Tier 2, too.  My record was 80+ applications, 3-8 phone interviews and two campus visits, and one offer.  4) What's Tier 2 anyway?  Non-Ivy and so-called public Ivy?  5) #4, I am not sure, my take was that tier 2 would be a non-doctoral university like an M1 that happens to have a PHD in bio.  However, I guess that might even be tier 4 depending on how you slice it.  IN which case, the poster should have even less to worry about????  6) OP here again, #3, yes I have good teaching experience and I also lecture occsionally as a postdoc. #4, I don't know what exactly Tier 2 means. My understanding was that its not in the top 100 schools.  I went to a mid-size state university, not ranked in the top 100. Or if you want to look at it in terms of research output, its considered a RU/H in the Carnegie classification, as opposed to an RU/VH. Either way, its the second level. 7) To the OP, have you had someone look over your application package?  Sometimes having a reference do it is not the most neutral perspective.  Is there someone in your cohort you would trust to give you an honest opinion?  Also, are you only applying to ""top"" programs as jobs, or how broad are you being in your search? 8) I am also non-American and currently without a visa allowing me to work in the US. I have around 40 publications, several grants as PI, even one Nature/Science. I have applied more than 50 times to US universities (mostly R1s). I have gotten interviews in Europe but never in the US, not even a phone interview. The visa situation should not be a problem, US universitites are used to dealing with that type of thing. 9) I am also asian. I think if you have a lot of publications and very productive, you will get attention. Just keep applying. don't give up. 10) OP here, THanks for the supporting comments. I definitely do not feel inferior and I continue to apply very seriously and with high optimism. Being Asian and then an Academic has conditioned me to a high tolerance for suffering!! #7: I have not had my application looked at my anyone I do not know quite well. What I do know is that my first application package was quite crappy, but it has evolved into a well shaped application more recently, as I have edited and rewritten a lot of it. I am applying broadly - I know that I cannot afford to be picky - especially with the low frequency of response I get from departments. What does bother me is to see some of the same people get multiple interviews and the only difference is that they came from some bigshot's lab. Thats really the root of my concerns.

The best advise that I got was after a non-advisor (but tenured) professor read my material and told me it was boring.  ha!  Also, I've had teaching faculty read my teaching statement and research faculty read my research statement, which has really helped! 3) Sometimes the most valuable part is just seeing the documents other applicants have used successfully, which some of those consultants do.

I've limited my statement to a cogent 3 pages, but maybe I should think about expanding mine. 4) I've always been told ot limit it to 2 pages. 5) I have looked at many successful apps in evolutionary genetics and by far the average is 2 pages with no/very few figures. A good compromise would be one page for accomplishments and two for the real research statement (future plans). 6) In evolution & ecology I think the 3 pages is pretty standard. I have job materials from 9 people who all got jobs at good schools (mix of R1 and SLAC) over the last decade. Of those 9, 6 are 3 pages long, 2 are 2 pages long, and 2 are only 1 page long. None are longer than 3 pages. Not exactly a large sample size, but my impression is that anything over 3 is getting too long (at least in my field). 7) I've read and heard 2-3 pages also, but I spoke to a search committee member from a search last year (Evo/Eco) who told me most (or all?) of the interviewed candidates had research statements 4-6 pages long, and that he felt like the 3 page statements were ""lacking"". I hate conflicting info! 6) I will say that all of the sample materials that I have are from people who got jobs 4-10 years ago. Maybe the page length has crept up? I could certainly fill another 1-3 pages, but I'd be afraid of it seeming too long.  7) Postdocs have gotten longer and more people do 2 postdocs now than before the economic recssion.  We are still recovering from that and it seems natural that very senior postdocs will have more research tracks to explain. 8) A standard would be nice - I do 3 with figs - most people I've talked to have suggested no longer than this. 9) Five to six, if going R1, unless there is a stated limit. Tons of figures. 10) I spoke to a search committee member friend (R1) and he said he prefers research statements that are less than 3 pages... 2 pages even better. 11) (R1 asst prof here) poster #9 is wrong-- I don't have time to read 2 pages, I am definitely not reading 6!!  If you can't say it in 2, you're not ready.  For the record, I haven't even read the entire statements of the folks on our short list! 12) #9 here again. So, since you aren't reading anyway, which is probably typical, it doesn't matter if it's 2 or 6. But maybe you looked at my 6 figures which can fit on a 6 page statement....just sayin'. Remember, what people say they want, and what they actually subconsciously prefer are often very different. ","I'm starting to feel trapped. I have a staff job at a research lab: good pay and security, but the culture is going to the dogs. Golden handcuff situation. I have almost no teaching experience and a so-so publication record because my job makes me spend too much time on admin and chasing funds, and I don't get students to work with. They're really happy with my work here, but I want out and it looks like I'm no longer competitive for academic jobs. :( 1) Dear OP, if you never try, you will never know. 2) I feel ya OP. A couple suggestions, can you affiliate with a reseaerch university to show an interest in academic research? Also, an effort to continue publishing in top level journals will be key to your escape. It is tough though when agencies don't value or care about journal impact factors and the time it takes to publish in top journals.","Publication gap as a postdoc I would like to get your honest feedback about how  a publication gap (2 years) may affect my chances of landing a Job in a R1/R2 university. I had a strong publicastion record as a Master (3 papers) and a PhD student (7 decent papers), however, getting publications as a postdoc has been quite difficult (and I was not strategic enough, I guess). Only now, starting my 3rd year as a postdoc I'm starting to publish. I got an Ecology Letters paper accepted (yeah!) and I think I will have two more papers out this year; but I'm not sure that will be enough to justify a 2 year publication gap in my CV. This year, I made the first cut in a couple of places, but no interviews. 2) well, it won't help, but with your previous strong publication record, it's not a killer. Seeing it on a CV, I'd wonder what was going on -- possibilities that would come to mind would include a) you published everything from your PhD early and started a new program of work for your postdoc, which involved a year or two of field or lab work before you could think about publishing; b) your postdoc position was exploitative and your supervisor had you working as a lab manager, field hand, sysadmin or something rather than doing your own research; c) you needed a lot of help and supervision to do all that publishing and are struggling to become independent; d) burn-out. I'd be curious but it wouldn't rule you out. (Congratulations on the Ecology Letters paper!)  3) I had a pub gap for reasons outside my control. Be upfront that you aren't happy with the situation and are trying as hard as you can to correct it.  Say it's ""unfortunate"" but try not to bash anyone, describe drama, or make excuses (unless you had a major life event that took you away from work-- explain that). Some committees will fault you for it, others won't.   4) at my R1 you probably don't quite have enough pubs for an interview  unless you're a good fit for the wierdly specific positions that sometimes get advertised. Explain your situation in your cover letter-- or ensure that one of your letter writers covers it in their letter.  Don't leave any questions for the committee to wonder about, if they're not sure, the committee will assume it's c) or d) of #2's list.  Questions about an applicant that are not answered by application are bad, the committee will usually not give you the benefit of the doubt.  A publication gap is problematic but not necessarily lethal. 5) I have served on 5 or 6 search committees, and (if the number & perceived quality of the publications was sufficient) I'm not sure I'd notice a publication gap unless it was ongoing. 6) Great question/convo! 7) Thank you all for your imput, it is very helfpul!","I am kind of glad it's weekend, so I don't receive rejections. Another painful week of disappointed hopes is starting soon x3 2) Ah, there it is. My number 1 just sent along a rejection... back to the drawing board. 3) honestly, having a ""#1"" is just setting yourself up for likely heartache. 4) My motto this year has been ""submit and forget"" That way if I hear back in a positive way, it's like a little happy surprise. I spent too many years of looking for a new gig stressing out over my applications, but it's just not worth it. 5) It's hard to not stress out over applications when you're in a post-doc that will eventually end whether you want it to or not. 6) number 2 again, except I have an on campus and fell in love. I apologize for being a human and getting invested in a place. and agreed #5 7) Understood. I already have a position, but it's toxic, so I've been looking for years and when I get vested and then get rejected there have been times where I'm pretty sure I needed therapy or to be medicated. I can't do that anymore if I want my wife to not divorce me or me to just not be able to function. ....but, I totally understand also not knowing where your paycheck will be coming from in 4 months, 6 months, etc. The job market sucks so bad right now and I can feel the anguish from you younger folks and it makes me want to stop taking grad students that think they want to go into academ","biased sample on ""Negotiations"" tab? I'm curious to see what everyone thinks of this. The ""Negotions"" tab has mostly post-docs that are getting jobs. But out of the four searches where I know all the candidates, every candidate was a current assistant professors. I know my sample size is low but, do others see more candidates that are current assistant professors making the final cut for in person interviews? The searches I know of were in ecology so it might be different based on specialty? Could the individuals that are willing to post on the negotions tab more likely to be current post-docs? I'm also wondering how this impacts my own job outlook since I am a first year post-doc. 2) Yes. The new pipeline is PhD, postdoc for indefinite period, short term AP at shitty U or VAP at better U, AP at decent. Also, never use this board as a data source. 1 here, I can't tell if you are being condescending and sarcastic #2 (all caps are confusing...). If you are, please go elsewhere. A simple - the negotiations tab is biased is enough. If you are not, thanks for the input. I thought my future might include VAP before AP. 3) I wasn't being sarcastic, but I went ahead and edited the caps in order to cease offending your sensibilities. Next time I will write the way you wish me to, guv'nor. 4) LOL. I will say that I have also seen the jobs that I make shortlists for go mostly to people who are already professors and the negotiations tab is quite obviously biased. However, there is a yearly analysis done at Dynamic Ecology that more completely tracks who is getting jobs. Control-f this page for the link. 5) Jeremy Fox of Dynamic Ecology here. Haven't tallied up the data on the fraction of recently-hired TT asst profs of ecology who held VAP or AP positions at the time they were hired into their current AP positions. But from having looked at well over 200 CVs of new hires over the past 2 years (by systematically trying to identify who was hired for every single TT ecology position listed on ecoevojobs.net, not looking at the ""negotiations"" tab), I can tell you it's low. A large majority of TT ecology faculty hires over the past 2 years were postdocs at the time they were hired. Hope this context is useful. 6) There you go, and you didn’t even have to say vulpes three times to summon him 7) Thanks for the feedback everyone. Jeremy, I read your Dynamic Ecology post from last year summarizing who was hired. Very informative! x3 8) I had AP job offers after a 2-year post-doc, and know of many others in the same boat. A few more who did second post-docs with AP offers early on in those. I don't personally know anyone who did the VAP before AP. 9) I did a postdoc followed by 2 VAP and then a TT AP. I continued to publish new data during those VAPs and I'm convinced that without doing so, it would have been a dead end. imo, the research program has to continue no matter the teaching load. I know many fellow VAPs who let their research die on the vine and so they are only competitive for teaching only positions (those are rarely TT). 10) Maybe people just want to teach? 11) Absolutely 10, I can't assume to know what others are aiming for. I was mostly just thinking of colleagues that were all applying for the same jobs.
","Anyone else considering industry? 2) After 200+ applications over the last three years, yes. Filling out applications today. 3) I still have a couple that are live and awaiting decisions, but yes. This is my last run through the academic gauntlet. If I'm gonna be working 80 hours a week and playing magician with deadlines time to get paid industry money. 4) I would love to, but I am a terrestrial ecologist without a lot of genomics skills so there is no real industry for me 5) @4 - environmental assessment?  statistical analysis? 6) Dynamic Ecology has posts on various non-academic careers for PhD-holding ecologists. Try this one https://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2013/05/22/guest-post-on-having-the-courage-to-build-your-own-non-academic-career-path/ and this one https://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2014/07/03/a-career-as-an-environmental-consultant-guest-post/ 7) Thank you, #6! x2 8) I'm a terrestrial ecologist too- considering climate change or sustainanility consulting. Might need some extra training but I think there are options. 9) Thanks, I really appreciate those links, but (I am not saying this to be mean) I don't think the myriad blogs like this contain much tangible advice beyond ""here is what you could be."" They don't layout the 'how.' Also, I don't find that stuff from six years ago is really applicable to today's market. For example, eight years ago I worked for the Federal Government making more money and working less hours than I do now as a postdoc, but I couldn't find a job like that again (and I have tried for years), and if I did, I probably wouldn't be competitive because all the superstars would apply as well. I am not whining, the market is what it is, but no one is really putting out good alt-ac advice because I don't think anyone knows the 'how' advice that lands alt-ac jobs. I am thinking of entering a data science bootcamp to learn hadoop and sql. Maybe I could build an AI to help some corporation sell more positive slogan t-shirts by tracking previous purchases and social media activity. I could just pretend the people are plants, the t-shirts are nutrients, and social network activity is community dynamics. 10) A labmate of mine who had some programming and GIS skills just did a health tech bootcamp (8 weeks) and got a sweet job from it paying way more than we'll ever earn 11) The 'how' is going to come from informational interviews. Start using every network you have to ask if people will talk to you on the phone for half an hour or over coffee- ask what they do every day, what skills they need, where the industry is going, what kind of people they've hired laterly... it's legwork for sure but I think it's the place to start 12) https://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2014/10/27/non-academic-careers-for-ecologists-data-science-guest-post/ 13) I went and did an Insight Data Science Fellowship.  I learned a lot, but the big thing is that most EEB people have most of the skills to go into industry, but they need to develop some other critical ones (a network being a big one, interview skills being the other).  People there came from all academic disciplines, and varied a lot in their mix of coding/stats/ML/big data skills.  Every single person that did it got a job making 100k+ within a couple months.  They also now have other programs that focus on the medical side, so people with genomics skills are pretty geared for that.  I don't think industry is perfect by any means, but when you see people getting professor positions paying in the low 50's for 60-80h/week, it's a no-brainer.  14) Thanks for sharing, did you get a job after the Insight Fellowship? Or, do you think it will help you land a job? There is a huge part of me that wants to do a bootcamp, but also there is a part of me that is resentful at needing more training, having spent the majority of my life in training. 15) I wound up applying for a professor of data science position at my university and got it. It's teaching focused and I love it... it allows me to blend all the skills I've developed.  They pay is also great with a lower workload... fields that have draw outside of academia have to pay a bunch more.  I'm 100% confident in my ability to jump to industry if I wanted to, though (but I don't want to!). I get the being annoyed at more training thing, but it's honestly not much that we have to learn...  a bit of SQL, some more CS, and how industry thinks/speaks.  Getting an academic job takes years...  a couple months of training plus a couple interviewing is nothing compared to that! 16) Thanks again for sharing, that is great stuff and really inspiring. 17) One last question if you have the time: did you do the on-site or remote fellowship? 18) I applied for remote but said I was willing to travel.  They offered me an on-site position.  From what I gathered on-site people get jobs the fastest, but they have to deal with moving and whatnot.  The remote program is very competitive.  The pro to remote is that you can stay where you're at (obviously), but the con is that it takes longer to get a job as there are fewer remote positions.  If you're in a mid-sized city it would be easier being a remote fellow as there are likely positions around you.  The on-site positions just really benefit from having a local network that gives them a direct feed into companies that Insight works with or has alumni at.  Like, companies pay Insight to have first dibs on interviewing fellows. It bypasses the HR filters which is one of the most difficult steps.  Additionally, I found other benefits to the onsite program in that It gave me a chance to interact with a wide variety of potential coworkers, while also demonstrating that working in an office on a more 10-6 schedule isn't a huge deal. 18) What level of programming and stats did you have when you applied for the fellowship? I am thinking of applying for the upcoming class but my R and stat skills are probably intermediate. I am also wondering if my background in terrestrial plant ecology can in anyway be transitioned into industry or can I find jobs that are remotely linked to environmental/conservation biology. 19)  I had solid R skills, but more coding stats rather than actual programming.  Most bootcamps are in Python, which I spent a few weeks learning before going to Insight.  You need to be a overall good coder, but you're not expected to be a master.  Most stats used are chi-square, t-tests and linear models, which others in the program haven't ever used given their backgrounds.  You'll also have good experimetnal design skills along with experience working with messy data.  So you'll have your own range of skills to bring to the table.    ",Anon Quals Ambiguity ,"All the Number Applied cells got set to 1. :-(   2) All right. Who's been screwing up the wiki.....? 3) Somebody employing wishful thinking, apparently  AP) Could've also been a script gone awry.  I get a few ""too many simultaneous invocations"" errors sometimes.  Well, luckily we have a backup.","Ask about Salary Inflation when you are negotiating  I'm 1.5 years into a TT track position at a SLAC and just discovered that the institution has a long history of not raising salary to adjust for inflation, which means that the cost of living is going up and I am struggling to afford it. I had no idea this was an issue for some places. If I'd know I would have asked and I would have made it a point of negotiation. Please don't make the same mistake. 2) and make sure to get the Dean AND the HR version of the answer. I was in a TT at a horrible place (hence why I'm here again) where HR told me about an annual 1.5% increase and other adjustments that are ""normal"" just to have the Dean later tell me that promotion and the very rare merit base were the only ways to bump salary. 3) Here in the UK salaries haven't gone up since the 1970s 4) Faculty will (generally) be forthcoming with this information during interviews - accepting a position is a big decision so good to get as much information as possible. (4) get out if you can; I have had only a $1000 rise in 9 years with little hope of anything in the future. Unfortunately getting out at my age now is about impossible. 5) Does that $1k include promotion? If so, that's pretty bad. 5) The lack of transparency in salaries at private universities compared to public institutions is a big problem. data.chronicle.com can be helpful though in getting a general notion of pay and salary increases from asst to assoc to full. 6) I think its also important to ask at SLAC schools about faculty realignments and other future initiatives. With the pace of layoffs in faculty and closing at these institutions you can really get into a position that wont be around for much longer. "
"Race Since this has turned into a ""just curious"" forum for those of us who are just curious, I'm curious as to how many African Americans, Asians, Hispanics, Native Americans, and other under represented groups are currently looking for jobs in the ecology (EEB) field. I'm the only Black postdoc in my department (only Black person in the department) and am the only Black that I know of that is currently looking for a TT faculty position. I have a pretty good CV, lots of good pubs, experience, etc. I've landed one interview out of 29 applications. Those of you who are here (if any), any luck getting a job?  No luck so far. 2) I think that there is such an underrepresentation of minority groups that it should really play to your advantage, especially if you are quite competitive on paper anyway. Make sure you have a nice web page with a photo of yourself! (3) Nothing against the OP, but I just think it's interesting how Asians are conspicuously left out of his/her list. It could well be just a slip, but I'd like to think it's something subconcious. Sure, there're tons of Asians doing bench biology, but how many Asian ecologists can you think of? Especially TT faculty? Anecdotally, I can definitely think of more Hispanic ecologists than Asian ones, for example. Yes, I'm Asian, but I'm not dwelling on that. 4) ""... and other under represented groups"". , Give us a break #3, don't expect ALL ""under represented groups"" to be ""listed"" on someone's ""just curious"" vent. We don't have enough cell space. P.S. Of the groups mentioned including yours, there are way more Asian ecologists than all others combined. That said, there's definitely a dearth overall. So answer the OP's question. Any luck on the market #3? (5) #3 here. ""other under represented groups"", Geez, so what other (major) racial groups are there besides the ones listed by the OP? The fact that Asians are merely implied in the ""other groups"" is a suggestion to me that there's a subconcious omission of them from the under-represented group. So, fair enough that Asians are proportionally (or more so) represented in other fields of biology like biochemistry or molecular biology, but c'mon, you can't tell me that Asians make up the second largest group of ecologists. That's horse shit. But like I said, I'm not dwelling on this. I believe academia should be merits based. To that end, I'll answer the OP's question: in the 3 years since getting out of grad school, I've applied to ~70 positions, with about half a dozen phone interviews, but no campus interview to this date. (6) OP here. I'm sorry #3/5. You make a good point. I genuinely meant nothing by omitting Asians. I added them to my post. Good luck on your search! (7) #3 again. No hard feelings, OP. Like I said, I got nothing against you and my comments weren't targeted at you/your post specifically. And thanks for the adjustment. Good luck to us all in the job hunt!
(8) Overall, OP, one interview out of 29 applications lands you in the higher end of the achievement range this year. A second thing to look at is your subfield. The bias toward ""hotter"" subfields or topics is stronger than almost any other in ecology. Thus, a person who does computer modeling and incorporates genetic data into her/his analysis, but has only 3 publications, is more likely to get an interview for a general ""ecologist"" ad than would a person who works on basic animal ecology and has 8-10 publications and teaching experience. Of course, having successful grant applications to your name trumps most everything else.
9) OP again, I should mention that I did not ultimately get the offer from that one interview. But, yes, I do think that out of 29 apps. my numbers are numbers are pretty good, relative to what I've seen on here. Although from the my apps, I haven't even made a single short list. oh well...keep pluggin away... 10) What about first generation Americans/immigrants as underrepresented minorities? I think the diversity should incorporate more than just race, since people from all races have numerous obstacles to overcome. Just a thought, and not trying to start a war. (11) The question is whether first generation Americans per se (if we don't take country of origin into consideration) are truly underrepresented in academia as a whole, and in E&E specifically. In general, my familiarity with ecologists as a whole lead me to believe that the lack of minorities in the field is, overall, due to a failure in recruiting underrepresented minorities to E&E majors and graduate programs, rather than to discrimination in hiring. This is likely true for first generation Americans, as well. While we have made great strides in convincing Americans that environmental issues are important, we have not done so well in presenting E&E research as a prestigious and worthwhile occupation, compared to, say, engineering or biomedical research. (12) You are all a bunch of whiners- how about blue collared white trash from well-known redneck states? Here is some advice: pick a field that you love that also has some clear paths for TT positions or clear paths for non-academic positions (your #2 or #3 may have to suffice). Venting doesn't mean ""I am so victimized.."" (13) I didn't delete the OP, but I fixed it (this is #3, BTW). 
(14) Ahhhh, #12 stages ""The Return of the Troll!"" Our little troll has returned. Tell me, did it hurt when the Biggest Billy Goat Gruff knocked you off your bridge?

16) There's a Black post doc in my department. She's more of a evo/genetics ecologist. She applied to few jobs this year. No interviews though. (17) @15: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Billy_Goats_Gruff   and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troll_(Internet)","Timing of searches Does it seem like many of the searches this year are going especially late?  Also many late ads.  Is it the economy and being sure they have money for the line or are SCs just inundated with apps?  Some combination? (1) Saw two late ones (one came out couple weeks ago, other today) that I would like to apply for.  I wish they would have been earlier (may have to make decisions before these jobs are ready to move).  (2) yes. Usually, I have been hoping for offers right now, instead I am just hearing about phone interviews.  ",NA,NA,NA,"How many of us had a phone or on-campus interview over the break or more recently and are just sitting waiting, knowing that the start of classes is going to make this xtra long? :( I'm worried that we're basically done this year. Some of us haven't advanced at any of the jobs that we've applied for, and are hoping either for those jobs to advance, and probably more to the point, for some new jobs to come on line! 2) sorry to say but I don't think there are many more TT jobs that will come online. There should be some VAP however. I have always wondered the pros/cons of a VAP vs as Postdoc...I have done 4 years of a postdoc and am wondering if I should try a VAP to make my application more enticing to SLACs. 3) I think it depends on where you want a job and what the chair of the department at the school you want to work at thinks.  I am at an M.S. level school and our current chair would probably rather see folks doing more postdoc, whereas our last chair would have liked to have seen the additional teaching experience.  I think most 4-year schools would like to see extra teaching experience, R1 would, obviously, want more research experience, and M.S. level are a guessing game.  I do know that once you get past about 7-8 years of postdocing that your application starts to look worse, as many think there is something wrong with you for having not gotten a fulltime position for so long.  Regarding the lack of TT positions from here on out, I generally agree, but some places where they have lost faculty may want to replace that position ASAP for fear of losing it and may look to hire TT right away, but, I imagine, instances like these are limited. 4) (#2 here) Thanks #3...MS institutions are such a black box to me. One more question. How would your chair look at hiring someone from an SLAC? I have some interviews and will likely have 4-6 more pubs regardless of the whether I stay in current postdoc (15ish total). My point is whether it is a negative to be from an SLAC. I think I would be happy with an SLAC but not sure and don't want to ruin future chances. 5). It is very negative to be from a SLAC if applying to a reserach univ. I have tried to publish my way out and upward for the last 5 years. I think you are labeled as a competent teacher at best. Unfortunately, and ironically, the least important quality in the competition for Masters and Doctorial institutions, unless of course, it is for a lecturer's position. 6) there are usually two peaks each year.  The first is sometime between November and January with the period between Oct and Jan having the most vacancy deadlines each year.  Then, there is a second peak that occurs somewhere around March.  However, this year has been very strange.  I think a lot of schools balked at posting for deadlines in Feb this year due to the problems that were occurring in Congress in Sept-Oct.  I bet at least some of these end up popping up this month and next with deadlines in March-April.  I've been following these trends for a decade and there has never been a year without a peak around March.   7) Thanks #6...We will see. I have been applying for positions seriously for about 3 years. I get updates everyday from the Chronicle/Higher Ed Jobs/Ecol Society and I have never applied for a position as late as March...I hope you are correct!   8) I am not going to pretend its a big peak like in the fall, but generally, there is a good peak.  These are almost universally smaller schools, community colleges, and masters level institutions. 9)  3 here again, as 5 mentioned,  I think my current chair would frown upon hiring someone from an SLAC unless they had some major pubs and grants.  Sad, really.  Other chairs may think differently.  A lot of these M.S. level schools, though, are starting to think they are R1 schools and are thinking like them.  Truth is that you still have to teach way more, you are less likely to land big grants at these smaller schools, and they often lack the infrastructure to support major research endeavors anyway.  Makes little sense to me.  I traditionally thought of M.S. level schools as having a good balance of research and teaching.  You needed to be a good teacher and you need to get some research done, but they weren't the publish or perish kinds of schools like R1s.  Now, it seems like many want it all, but don't have much support for their faculty to pull it off.  I sprouted many a gray hair on my way to tenure, but I also had three children along the way too, so that may have also been a contributing factor.  ;)  Truth of the matter is that I don't sleep very much.  Not even now that I've gotten tenure, as very shortly we will begin post-tenure reviews and every once and a while there are merit raises that are supposed to be based on productivity (although I think our chair bases them more on who kisses his ass the most).  10) There was a thread earlier about MS institutions. I think they are more of a mystery and can easily find themselves in an identity crisis. I think SLACs and R1s mostly 'know who they are'. That being said, I have met people at MS institutions that are really happy too. Seems to be highly dependent on the department.  11)  All MS institutions are either trying to become research institutions or LACs.  This is why they are so confusing. ","Worse job season for me in the last 3-4 years of me looking for a new gig.  I've now seen every application I've submitted being passed by and I credit those that congratulate the folks that get the interviews, but all I'd like to do is flip them the bird for beating me out.  Being gracious is all good and fine, but the truth of the matter is that you didn't get the interview and no matter how nice you are to those that did, it's not going to help you get interviews in the future, so fuck all of you that have gotten interviews and offers this year.  ;)  ....oh, and congrats!  ;) 2) Social Darwinism is a bitch","Interfolio When you submit application materials for SLAC please try and see if you can fit in with the faculty, students, space, etc. It is not worth anyone's time for you to submit applications if you are not a fit or can't figure out how to fit in. The biggest tip off for a SCM when reviewing letters is to read that you’re so excited to teach and enjoy teaching but you haven’t really ever done any other than a TA two years ago. Find a way to lecture for a few semesters or adjunct during your post-doc. Something that separates you from the rock star research scientist with no teaching experience. If you state that you love teaching undergrads and grads and are excited to engage graduates in your program at XYZ college and that college doesn’t have a graduate program, that is a good sign you are not a good fit. I will never understand why applicants would ever put in their letters who they will collaborate at XYZ college when they don’t have any history of collaborating with the named faculty.  What if the named faculty doesn’t want to collaborate with you? What if you make an error in who works on what, this happens a lot? Websites at many universities tend to be behind a few years on what people are doing.  Better to come across with your passion to engage students and spell out how you will tailor your amazing research and teaching to the place you are applying to than to take a leap of faith that your going to collaborate with Jane Doe and when Jane Doe is on the search committee and says I’m not excited about the applicant’s research questions. Hard to recover from these errors when the application pool is 100+ folks and 25 or more are very qualified.  Good luck and everyone understands how much of a struggle it is for ecologists today. 2) Wow. Not ONLY did the OP delete my comment (about their atrocious grammar and writing), but then they went back and corrected their original post! Breathtaking! It is utterly amazing that these are the people at the helm of many institutions scrutinizing the current applicant field. There actually may be no hope at this point. The end is nigh! 3) The individual didn't correct everything as one sentence still ends in a preposition. 4) Ending a sentence with a preposition is not grammatically incorrect. It is simply an issue of style (http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/aug/15/steven-pinker-10-grammar-rules-break). Also, how do you know that the OP deleted your comment? Finally, grammar policing is a cheap shot. Who the fuck cares; this is a silly discussion board. Get a grip.5) Silly enough that you felt compelled to argue about grammar! It's a trap!!!11 6) It is a trap! Although along with getting a tenure track job, my other goal in life is to stop this silly notion that we cannot end sentences with prepositions. 7) Of course, it sounds more like a search committee member whose cronie friend did not qualify because too many good candidates applied.  Then, if you don't apply, hey, they don't have to invent some bozo reason you did not fit because fit is nothing but a BS excuse for not hiring someone. Fit is not quantiative, its not objective, and its not quantifiable, NOR is it a valid term in a court of law when ageism, sexism, or racism is involved.  Teachers are a dime a dozen.  Don't believe me, walk around academia. Anyone who wants to be a decent teacher can be, and most peole can be good teachers just by putting in effort.  However, if they don't want peole who actually do research, maybe they should advertise for an Ed.D. or DA. Both of those are largely degrees earned by non-research folks who can do what a SLAC does.  OR, just ask for an MS.  8) this poster seems to think all of us applicants can read their minds.  Spell it out if you want it bub. 9) The OP offers good advice for getting a job at a SLAC. It doesn't take some crazy mind-reading technique to follow. Get some teaching experience. Tailor your application to the institution. I also think naming faculty collaborators in application materials is awkward and fraught with problems - at any institution. The person may not be interested in collaborating or others whom you do not mention might be. At a SLAC, your primary job will be teaching and engaging undergraduates in small research projects. Focusing primarily on your brilliant, ground-breaking research is demonstrating a lack of respect to the institution. And finally, fit is pretty important. Not everything is quantifiable. You are going to be colleagues for 10-20 years or more. They want you to be happy and fulfilled at that institution and to do that, your values/objectives should be in line with the department and school. SLACs aren't simply little versions of R1s; if that is your view and the persona you put forth in your application, you simply won't be getting a job at one of those places.  10) Oh come on #9.  These folks misadvertise ads all the time, and it is not restricted to SLACs. There are multiple schools out there this season that advertised need for one kind of faculty member and hired someone at the complete other end of the spectrum.  It is so common that you migh tas well just send your CV into every job and let the search committees roll dice.  THey are very fickle.  You don't advertise for asst-assoc and then hire someone who graduated last week with no pubs or teaching experience.  You don't advertise for someone who will do research if you want them to rot in your dungeon.  Plenty of people who want to rot.  So, describe what you want.  This year there was exactly one, count it, ONE add posted that said ""teaching will be your main responsiblity and then made no reference to research.  They know what they want and are advertising properly to get it.  The others are just lying to themselves and the aplicants. 11) #9 again...thanks for the advice. I will now just send out my applications and not tailor them at all. SLAC, Master's level, R1 ecology, evolution. None of it matters. It is all a bunch of cronyism and incompetence. The good applicants never get jobs. The wold is against us.  12)  #11, this is #9.  Good applicants do get jobs, but do not under-estimate the amount of cronyism an incompetence that exists.  When a school hires someone who has 1-2 pubs, not teaching experience and advertised for people with teaching experinece and a publication record...AND I know for a fact there were multiple applicants who had both in excess, it tells me that something else is at play.  I have seen search committee chairs call applicants and convince them to drop out of the pool so they could get their friend in (yes, first hand that is).  I've also seen committee members remove someone from the pool because ""they would not come here, or stay.""  Yes, that is also a first hand observation.  From the applicant's perspective its a big freaking mess because it is virtually impossible to tell what they REALLY want. In fact, I am 100% confident that I can go through the adds, pull one from an R1 and one from a pure teaching school, and read you teh description, and you won't be able to tell which is which.  I've done it, its crazy.  Committees need to define what they really want, and say so.  IF they want a new grad so they can abuse them and take advantage of them, just say so.  We only wnat people two years out of their PHD.  Don't put out an advertisement for a researcher and complain you got research applications.  13) To #7. I think you are saying that good teaching is easy and that faculty at SLAC don't do research. You are wrong on both-- I'm at a SLAC and I'll put my research CV against yours anyday in terms of publication quality, quantity, and NSF grants and I'll out teach you and then beat you in basketball and you can head home and blame others for your misfortune as an academic. Know something before you insult others 14) Nice #13. The ideas of #12 are a bit wacko. I have applied for countless SLACs and R1s. Reading the job ad and taking 10 minutes on the department website gives a pretty good indication of what type of people they are looking for. Also, I think candidates should always underestimate cronyisms and ineptitude. I am not sure why it is helpful to think that most departments are looking for people to ""rot in their dungeon"". I think being arrogant, self-pitying and deeply suspicious of everyone is a crappy way to go about your life. 15) #13 NO, I am not saying that.  You said that.  I will say that good teachers are a dime a dozen and good researchers are not.  The numbers bear this out. Every highschool in America has good teachers.  Every grade school in America has good teachers, Every college and university in America has good teachers.  However, it is clear that good researchers are not abundant in any of these forays.  I have taught at SLACs and R1s.  They are not the same thing.  However, there is a difference between those who do research that can be done with the resources of an SLAC and those who do no research.  The latter are all too prevalent in all levels of academia.  People who do NO research rapidly decay. Its a fact, belabor it and argue otherwise all you want.  Its a fact. Period.    16) to #13.  wacko huh?  You eithr are one of these people covering your own behavior or inexperienced outside your own blinders.  Your life will be much less happy living a lie or living in some version of lala land than you will living in reality.  Reality is, everyone is gaming the system. Advisors, faculty, admin, students, politicians, citizens.  Everyone is looking for shortcuts, promoting their own version of reality in ways that will best benefit themselves.  The few who are not, are very difficult to find, and valuable to know. 17) Cool #16 - you've got it all figured out. Glad you are doing well. 18) To #7, #9, #13, et al: Hug it out, kids. 19) Hard to believe that all you biologists haven't figured out that nothing is ""black or white"". There's a lot of variation in jobs (even between universities in the same category) and everyones' experiences are unique and their own. None of you are right and none of your are wrong. All of my experiences in academia have been extremely positive. There was probably a little bit of luck involved.   20) to #19, that was my experience through the early 2000s.  Then a lot more of the dark side started to show its head.  Despite my above comments, I am not suggesting academia is overall horrible, just that there are enough bad apples to spoil a department.  Even so, its not like I've stopped applying or quit academia.  21) hard to over estimate fit at SLAC.  21) Wow.  Some of you should just give up. 22) I'm TT at a SLAC, and the best advice I can give to someone who wants to end up at a SLAC is to do your homework on the places to which you apply. Some are very teaching heavy, some are not. Some do very impactful research, some don't. Some get lots of big grants, some don't. Find out about the ones to which you will apply. The field it so competitive that we get outstanding researchers who are very passionate about teaching and have experience. Even if actual teaching opportunities are difficult to find where you are, get training and formal mentoring in pedagogical techniques so that you don't say stupid things like, ""lecturing is the best way for students to learn."" On the flipside, teaching can be learned at many SLACs through faculty development programs, and if research is strongly encouraged, then the place may be looking for someone who comes across as ""ready to go"" as a lab PI. 23) #22 gives great advice, I'm also TT at a SLAC, please read and take to heart. 24) Yeah, you pretty much just have to lie and talk about how much you love a ""non-traditional"" classroom environment. Only thing is, every other applicant is saying the exact same crap. The only way to really know if someone is interested in novel pedagogical techniques is if they can demonstrate experience using them. Thus, without teaching experience, applying at some SLACs (not all) is pretty much a lost cause. I don't know how many applications I read this year that say stuff like, ""I love a flipped classroom"" and/or ""case-based studies are the best,"" or whatever other ""hot"" terms in pedagogy are sexy at the moment.  However, half of the people saying this stuff have never even tried using these approaches (or had the opportunity). I almost wish that someone would say, ""I get up and lecture, b/c all the other stuff is just gimmick crap for lazy professors who don't know their material."" That would really make my day, even though I don't believe that. Some variety would just be nice when reading teaching statements. To be honest, you just read some teaching statements and say, this person knows what they are talking about. The other 90% are just people telling you what you want to hear. 25) I concur with what has been said by those at SLACs. Between last year and this year, the one thing that is different for me is that I actually have experience with these hands-on learning techniques and know how to talk about them. When I look at my materials from last year, it is glaringly apparent that I was only telling them what they wanted to hear. The rub? Two offers this year and zero last year out of an equal number of campus visits. Just be as honest as possible in your materials. They will figure out if you are full of shit at some point. 26) A key piece of any job application is ""showing not telling"". For teaching, providing examples of how you teach is really key for an SLAC. Even if you don't have experience teaching, I encourage you to still apply to SLACs (if that is what you think you want). First, it is better to let the search committee throw away your application instead of you. Second, in writing the application, it will help you see your own weaknesses. Then make sure to get experience so that you (and your letter writers) can ""show"" your teaching abilities through examples. 27) #26, this is true so long as your advisor or yourself is connected.  That is how it works.  All my jobs were because I knew someone, and everyone else's are too.  IF you got hired, its because someone knew someone whom they trusted.  You have to do all that other stuff, but without connections you are dead i the water today. ",The window is closing... searches are moving fast these days... arghhhh!,"Letters of recommendation 1) Would you recommend providing more letters than is asked by the search committee? Or would it be frowned upon?  2) It wouldn't bother me but I don't see the point. 3) No.  Follow directions.  The job market is too tightly competitive to give them any reason to disqualify you.  3) A (very successful) friend says he listed his extra ref on the CV but didn't ask to submit the letter if not allowed. ~ 90% of search committees contacted the extra reference. 4) I always ask for more letters, because I have flaky writers. I sometimes ask for 5 if 3 is listed. 5) member of a SC here-- can't see why that would be frowned upon, most apps are lacking one or more letters past the due date, and the chair of the comittee will have to pester writers for them of those on our long short list. You might mention in your cover letter that you've asked for extra letters, and state why (diplomatically of course)","During my on-campus interview today, a faculty member asked me if I had kids. WTF!? 1) congrats for the on-campus interview, you are among the top of many applicants. 2) This shouldn't happen, but I've seen it slip out on many occasion. Hopefully the answer (whether yay or nea) is not counted against you. If it is any consolation, in my experience it does not seem to be (these days). 3) Unless you are a woman and the person asking the question was a man, it's unlikely a problem. 4) Person 3 is right- I'm a woman and man asked the question. However, he was talking about his own kids when he brought it up... but still, come on, this is basic HR knowledge! 5) I'll preface my comment by saying that I am a single female and I don't have children.  I had a campus interview where one guy wanted to discuss my personal life - i.e. relationship status, kids, etc.  He was miserable in that town and basically told me that if I was single, I'd be miserable there too (even though he had a spouse and kids??).  He also wanted to know about the other interviews I was going on and made me feel obligated to talk about it.  I think he was *trying* to help me out but really, it just felt awkward and unprofessional. I actually don't mind talking about these things if they come up naturally.  I had another interview where I offered up the information without being asked (this was while talking to a female faculty member). I guess the main difference was that I felt like I was being interogated by the guy, but didn't feel pressure to give that information to the woman. 6) I had way more sexist bullshit about kids from young female faculty than men.  One told me not to show up because I would not fit in if I did not have kids.  Another told me to keep my hands off her husband before I had ever even met him. Another female faculty argued not to hire me because I wouldn't be able to afford a house in the right school district for kids I do not have.  I have no idea how many of those other people tried to sink my hires. It shouldn't come into hiring, but it does, and anyone who says otherwise is lying or uninformed.   It's difficult to get hard evidence when discussions are (semi) secret, so normal reporting/legal recourse just isn't an option. 7) Yes, people should know not to do this, but I've been asked on several occasions (I'm male) - I think that most want to provide you with information on the quality of school districts etc. and they don't want to drone on about that if you don't have kids. I suspect some people may be biased towards wanting the candidate to have kids now or in the future but the opposite is also possible.  8) I'd like to think that 95% of people who bring up such topics are just trying to be helpful and/or sociable.  That said, it can wait for the second visit when you're trying to recruit the chosen candidate.  And F the other 5% of people who have an issue with having kids or not. x2  9) I once had an interview when a male faculty member asked if I had kids (I am male), but I don't think he is being malicious or anything. There is nothing wrong with that question. I think he is just being helpful and wanted to provide more information on the school district. FYI, I didn't get that position. But I also think it is not because I don't have kids but probably for other reasons. I just think it is absurd that a search committee will reject you if you have or do not have kids. Big papers, grants and potential for future successful research/quality teaching are more important in their decision whether to hire you or not. If you interview at a place where having kids are more important than your Nature or Science paper, then that place is probably not worth going to. 10) Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Guy here. I don't know the context, but let me explain to you why you're overreacting...  x5 7-again) ahahahaha, well ok. Was just trying to point out that this while this shouldn't happen, it is very common that it does - it is likely that it was not a situation where someone was asking to count it against you (if it was that situation, you are of course fucked which is why they shouldn't ask). But from my point of view - my response was trying to ease your concern that this having happened will have hurt you - it probably won't. Not saying that you are over-reacting - it is B.S. that in 2016 we are still being asked these questions at interviews - this has not been ok for a long time. Good luck.  11) From my understanding it is not illegal to ask these questions, it is illegal to make hiring decisions based on marital status, etc.  So the safe thing to do is not discuss them at all.  That said, a better way to approach this issue might be ""are you interested in hearing about local schools?"", something like that.  I have had some overt biases in interviews.  In one place, where I was one of several internal candidates (we were all adjuncts), I was told that I would not be hired because I was single and therefore was not likely to stay in the area. 12) I'm not an employment lawyer, but I believe it is in fact illegal - under both state & federal laws - to ask questions whose answers would reveal marital status, religion, race, sexual orientation, pregnancy, and the like - unless the answers to said questions pertain specifically to employment qualifications. (I think this would be, rightly, hard to demonstrate for academic positions.) Religious institutions may be able to claim some exemptions, I do not know about that, and this applies only to the U.S. - I'm unaware of the law in other countries.  12) SC member here-- it is not illegal to ask, instead it is illegal to base decision on protected statuses, irrespective of  whether info was volunteered or in response to a question.  So HR tends to forbid asking about it, since why ask if you can't consider.  But this raises issues-- my uni wants diversity and yet we can't ask or consider whether candidate is, e.g., female or minority.  In fact the saftest interpretation of HR's rules is that, when offering to direct a candidate to the restroom, we are supposed to point them in the direction of both and let them decide which to use!  13) That's impressively inclusive!! 14) @12, LOL, I'm using that next time we search.","previous affiliation I heard from a postdoc at University of Texas that one of the first things the SC did to get to a short list was cull anyone with a previous affiliation to UT. How common is this? And why not mention it in the job ad? 2) I could only imagine doing this if absolutely spoiled for choice and swamped with outstanding applications. In that case, it might be nice to mix things up a bit to avoid intellectual inbreeding by taking the step you mention. But I wouldn't expect it to be common. 3) It is not common. 4) I doubt they could say so in the job ad even if this was their plan-- the job ad has to pass thru HR and any sort of stated bias is unlikely to look good even if it's not against a protected category.  Also, super strange to be biased AGAINST alums, many universities are looking for someone who knows the local culture and wants to be there, and who better than an alum of the program to do so, provided the inbreeding issue raised by #2 is not a problem? 5) I think actually culling based on any affiliation is uncommon, but a strong bias against alums is definitely common. Some places have a reputation for favoring alumns and others definitely do not. At my grad school (top 5-10 for evolution & ecology) there were a few profs who had previous connections, but in order to come back like that you had to be head and shoulders above the competition and you had to have been gone for quite a while before they would consider hiring you back there. 6) I agree with #5. Generally, search committees tend to be biased against their own alums - particularly when hiring at the junior level. This can come simply from the fact that the faculty were the same faculty that knew you as a Ph.D. student & may have trouble thinking of you as a colleague. An explicit culling - that, I haven't heard of before. 7)  Well, also if your major advisor is still there, why do they need another person with the same or similar expertise?","I just clued in that the page is owned by ""Anonymous Potato"".  Brilliant move, my friend. ","invitation without virtual interview I have been invited on-campus without preliminary being tested with a skype/phone interview. How about I am crazy and waste them tons of money and time? Is that common? 1) It is very common that folks get invited on-campus before skype/phone interviews. I think the skype thing is recent. Congrats! 2) Just try to suppress your craziness for two days at the interview 3) Congratulations and good luck! 4)  Did they make you mail in your app too?  ;)  Very old school nowadays to flat out invite someone without a little more to go on first, but all the better for you. 5) Happened to me last year at a top R1 and I got the job. Good luck. 6) I've been aware of a few searches that have done this within the last few years. They've all been at R1s and have typically been searches that were bringing in 4-5 candidates anyway, so 1-2 crazy candidates likely wouldn't sink the search and it saves everyone the time of phone interviews (which I think are pretty worthless in most cases). 7) I personally think this should be done more often. Having served on SCs, it's often clear who the top candidates are. Yes there are cases where folks ""come out of nowhere"", but I also don't like wasting folks time. At a minimum, if you don't need a phone or skype for your finalist list, don't do it. 8 ) 4 out of 5 of my on-campus interview came without skype/phone interview. It's quite common. 9) Agree with #6 and 7, on the searches I've been a part of it was an absolute waste of time. Now, don't get me started on reference letters... 10) I'm actually curious, are you saying ref letters are a waste of time too? 11) Many non-US places don't even request letters until after they have done on campus interviews. 9 again) @10, yes, and not only that there is good evidence that letter writers tend to provide poorer (or let's be honest, less glowing) references for women and minority scientists. @11, I agree this would be best policy, and only for the candidate that you would like to make an offer. 12) a good letter takes a lot of time from the letter writter (if they do a good job writing one tailored to the job).  On a SC, I would rather request really good letters specific to the position at the time of on-site interviews vs. generic letters from 70 candidates (X3).  Plus, is the committee really going to read 210 letters?  Unlikely.  Plus agree with #10 on potential bias in letters.  ","Ahh, it's that time of year when I get all of the HR rejections.

Do not confuse my helpful, and perhaps encouraging, comments with that fact that I am still a prick. :-) 2) I hear ya. I can be a prick too. But, # 6 (below) brings up a good point, ripping on each other on here will accomplish little but make everyone on here even more tense. Sure we're all competing with each other but we're also colleagues. We should at least be civil. Can we be civil pricks? ; ) (3) I am #3&6 below. I can guarantee that I am a prick, but I don't mind helping people with the stuff that I wanted/needed help with. Maybe it will be reciprocated someday, maybe not. But the anonymity of the wiki means that I'll never know either way. Even if we're interviewing for the same job, I'd like to take a job from you on the strength of my interview/application packet, not because I made you cry on a wiki. When I'm still jobless a month or 2 or 3 from now, ask me how helpful I'll be then ;) At that point, you may realize that I am a prick! (4) I agree! check out #9 above.

Things that caught you off guard or that newbies might not expect? Thanks. (1) Tell me how you would teach class X. Be specific. Basically recite a syllabus from memory.(2) Well, my favorite was for a position where they seemed to want a researcher, they then told me the teaching load (3/3) and the next question was, given this teaching load how will you continue to publish and get research grants. I think I chuckled..I did not get a campus interview...(3) from a grad student on the SC ""Describe your perfect job"" I also laughed, said I didn't think that the perfect job existed, but went on to blabber about unlimited funding to do research, no publication pressure, high salary, no teaching.  I did recover and turn it into what I actually think would be the perfect job, but man, that was a dumb question.  Oxymoron anyone? 4) all my interviews asked #1 and #3, and no offense #2 but there are tons of schools with 3/3 loads that are still interested in how you will continue to do research or submit grants.  They are not looking for Science papers or big NIH grants usually, but they still want to know whether you've thought about how you'll proceed and what kind of research you'd do at a more teaching focused school.  I told my interviewers about smaller grant agencies or grant collaborations and described a reasonable publication plan given the teaching load.  I got job offers and my pub record is not that great.  4+)  Unanticipated phone interview question: ""are you surfing the internet? because you are pausing a lot.""  Turned out stopping to think about answers was unacceptable to this jerk.  A more relevant surprise question was: ""we just acquired this conservation property nearby, how would you utilize it?""  I actually got that question twice - and while I'm a field biologist, I'm not a cons biologist and they weren't cons bio positions. 5) I also got #1, which threw me off because they specifically wanted to know how I'd teach a ""plant responses to climate change"" class and that's not my area (I don't really know why I was interviewed, actually). I think I eventually came up with something coherent. I was also asked a version of #3, but it was ""describe your ideal teaching/research split"", which was not listed in the ad nor told to me during the interview process. It seemed like they were setting me up on that one. I should have come back with ""what is the split in this position?"" and then talked about how that would be ideal. I think the last one was something similar to #2. Given a 4/4 load, what will you do to balance teaching and research? I had no good answer for that. How DO people do it??? All of these were questions asked during a single interview, and I didn't get a campus invitation. I was not surprised. For my other phone interview this year, they gave me the questions in advance and were really respectful and friendly, and I got a campus interview (but ultimately not an offer).  (6) I kid you not this was the question (on campus interview) WTF do you want to come here? 7) Whoah! #6, please do elaborate. (8) I got a slightly different version of #1 - including name and defend the textbook I would use to teach the course.  My instinct was to respond that I would not design their course for them without compensation, but would get right on it once on the payroll.  Instead, I told them what they wanted. (9) - Not sure why #8 seems to be offended by this question.  I got it for >1 interview, as well as a prelims questions actually.  It is a good way to see how someone would design a course.  (10) for #7 in reference to #6...Well this prof had never been at a bad place and actually thought that his institution with a medical school, phd program, private labs, and 80K start up was a terrible place to work.  When he started the teaching load was 1/1 now it was 2/2 and that made it very hard to do his work.  Being that I never taught less than 4/4 and for a while at 5/5 it was a pretty funny remark in my opinoin! ",NA,NA,NA,"So I'm wondering why public universities make salary information public, but not the list of candidates for jobs?

It is so hard not to let yourself get your hopes up.","My potato job I've just seen a job advertised that is a perfect fit for me. So much so that if I apply, I'll be actively surprised if I don't get an offer. The skillset is a perfect match, the salary level is right, and I know the SC and have worked with them before. But it's in a part of the country that my spouse can't abide. :(   2) What is ""can't abide""? No jobs at all? Trans in  a threatening state??  Or just don't like it??  If it's just a preference: apply. I've seen too many people cope with something they didn't expect.  And it's easier to turn down later than to go back in time to apply.  3) Just interviewed at a place that felt 'great' - I'm not as confident as you are, but I think I'd be happy there. But yeah, same problem with my (currently long distance) partner - their work is all urban based and the nearest real city is 2 hours away! Also, they'll always make a way higher salary than me, so it's not very economical for them to give up their job. Aughhfhf.  4) Apply for it, get an offer then make the decision. The only time you can reject a job is when you get an offer. 5) I think you'll regret not applying more than turning down an offer. An offer makes you think harder because it's real. (But I do the same thing with jobs in failed states, too.) 6) I don't know. If I was 100% sure I wouldn't take it (because your spouse can't abide or whatever reason) I would not apply. Turning it down later sounds great and all, but getting an offer you really want and then having to turn it down would be (for me) a lot more painful than not applying. Of course, if there is even a sliver of a chance that you might be able to make it work then of course apply. I think that people often suggest applying for everything without thinking about how hard it would be to turn down an offer not knowing if/when you will get another. 7) I have turned down an offer without anything else on the horizon, it was really hard. But better to have applied, had the experience interviewing and making an informed decision. x2 8) I think y'all may be right. I'll apply anyway and see if I can turn him around on it if and when I get an offer. ""Can't abide"" means he hates the climate and might  struggle to find a good job there, and it's a partly military town, so he also isn't sure about the social side of things. I, on the other hand, love the climate there and am much more career-focused than he is. We could get by without his income, but it wouldn't be good for him just to play computer games all day (which is what he would do, left to his own devices).  9) By climate do you mean the weather?? Or politics? social options?  This sounds like you're giving up on your dream job for someone who would be perfectly happy to play video games all day.  I think you should apply for that job. x6","""We on the SC have forwarded our decision to the Dean. I have no further information for you other than that all candidates are still under consideration for the position"" (We offered it to someone else and they're sitting on it, so no, you don't get to know about our job until after you've closed the door on all your other opportunities. KTHXBAI.)",future of the (public?) academe ,"Just applied to a job that wants SIX rec. letters. Ridiculous! 2) You should ask the SC how long it took to not read 6 letters. x2 3) Up front? That's just stupid. 4) I would ask SC (cc-ing to other departmental faculties, chair, and dean as well) that whether or not they are also willing to write that many letters upfront for their students. 5) Is it an automated system that requests the letters or is there a way to get around it by just providing a list that they can then use to request letters at a later date if you are shortlisted? 6) They ask for six because five letters are not enough to give them a picture of how good the applicant is.. *sarcasm*... 7) That is stupid if true. 8) when you go up for tenure, 10-12 letters are common at R1 9) That's tenure. That's a 1-time thing for a specific goal. 6 upfront letters that (let's face it) no one will actually read when someone might already be asking for dozens is f-ing insane 10) And that's why requesting 10-12 letters for tenure is something they do one time for one candidate, not for 100 or more people. 11) OP here: somehow managed to get them all in on time. I figured the job description just wanted that many as a fallback in case one didn't show up on time. But no. They wanted all six of them.  12) Can that search committee not make up its own mind about candidates?  14) WHO ARE THESE MONSTERS??? 15) I suggest deleting this post if you want this job","Summer for faculty If you are currently in a TT or non-TT position, how do you spend your summer? Do you work on grants, research, and papers? Develop course material? or take a long vacation? Does it vary by SLAC, R2, R1, etc.? (2) R1 here: catch up on proposals/papers/field work, and take a vacation, 3) R1, write papers, do experiments, help graduate students, go to national meetings, feel guilty about not writing grants, try to not get fat and lazy, week or 2 of vacation, help department finish job searches that have dragged into the summer x2 3) do field work if I can find funding 4) Masters level: I teach, do research, and go to conferences. Sometimes I fit a vacation in, but usually just use the conference as a vacation. 5) Teaching track here...  summers are free and I rarely have hangover work.  So I can work on prepping a new class, or just teach another class or two for extra money. 6) SLAC: my field work for research with undergraduates spills into the summer from the spring semester. Then I always take a long vacation (5 weeks) to maintain my sanity and wellness. After returning from that, I prep like crazy for classes for the upcoming fall semester. I know that a 5 week vacation seems out of step with what most Americans can do, but I really value that time and make space for it. Without it, I don't think that I could mentally handle another full academic year. 7) Master's level with emphasis on research; ~2 weeks of no work, no e-mail vacation; work on papers, grants, field work the rest of the time, ~4 hours / day 8) Do y'all get paid for this work, or do you do it for free to keep your job / get tenure? 9) depends on if you are on a 9, 10 or 12 month contract. If 9 or 10, they spread your salary over those months, but you aren't technically getting paid for them. Keep in mind during negotiations! 10) non-TT position - summers spent doing research (beefing up the CV and pub list for the TT job market) and planning grants. It is much more laid-back and I can enjoy travel, but it's still very busy. Does take self-discipline due to its unstructured nature. 11) I never got the three months unpaid work thing 12) (7) here - as I've gotten closer to tenure, been more strict about only working during the un-paid summer months if I have external grants to pay me (or I get to be in the field); oh, and master's students love to defend in the summer, so while we're technically ""not required"" to review theses or attend defenses, I typically do about 3-6 of those (unpaid)","Anyone else see job talk advice about preparing months in advance and practicing like 20x, when in reality all we have is maybe ~2 weeks notice that we will get a campus invite? Hard to reconcile the job advice I see on some websites with the reality of how much notice to prepare we actually get, and it makes me nervous! 1) I think most people probably have a good idea of what they are going to put in a job talk and take materials from other presentations they have likely given multiple times. It's a matter a tweeking a few things to make it work for that particular institution (which you probably already thought of for research and/or teaching statements). 2) Agree, unless it is a pui with a specific teaching/lecture prompt as a job talk, your presentation will be similar from job to job, it does suck if you are doing it for the first time and only have a week or two to get it ready, but if you have done one, you will have a good base to start with. 3) My first job talk I couldn't even schedule a practice talk with faculty in time.  They tried to fly me up days after notifying and acted like I was an a-hole for trying to schedule 1 week later.  The search chair's postdoc was scheduled last -- 5 weeks after notifying.  It's unfair, and favors senior candidates.   I know it's hard to go into it knowing the playing field isn't level, but know even a rough interview will help you do better down the road.  Find someone worth asking for constructive criticism right after.   I think you'll get good feedback if you're upfront about not having time to practice as much as you wanted. Or who knows, maybe they push you to show up quickly because they really want to hire you no matter what. 3) as an interdisciplinary researcher interviewing for different departments, my talks are not similar from talk to talk, so.....not always the easiest 4) If you're interviewing outside the US, you might get a few days notice and find that the talk you had previously prepared doesn't remotely fit the time slot or the prompt. I've essentially had to rewrite my talk each time, and/or write a lecture on a specified topic from scratch, or a talk on how you'll get funding specific to that country's agencies and schemes. Last time, I was able to patch together my old job talk and a recent conference talk, but the conference talk had to be adapted to a completely different audience and would have filled up the entire time slot by itself in its original incarnation. Sometimes they give you less than 15 minutes. 5) I've seen a lot of job talks. You want  to be able to confidently explain your research and fit to the audience. But no, you don't need months and 20x practicing it. I actually think it can look too polished at some point. 6) OP here, thank you all for sharing your advice and experiences, it has really helped me manage my stress! 7) Wow 4, that is ridiculous. I would love to hear a podcast about some of these experiences. 7) I feel so much pressure to tailor each talk specifically to each institution and I end up making talks from near scratch. Also I hate that some schools use 4:3 format and others 16:9 and I need to redo all the slides for aesthetics 8) Do they actually tell you what slide format? None have for me and I feel like asking at this point would end up inducing more panic. I guess black bars along the sides or top aren't end of the world anyway. 9) I always ask in advance because I want to avoid my own obsessive panic on aesthetics, but that might be a personal obsession!  10) You need to show them what kind of scientist you are, not completely modify your talk to fit what you think they want to see.  I have 3 job apps: one focuses on methods development/computation, one emphasizes molBio, another is hard core evo.  I'd only change a few slides for talks, to emphasize those different parts of my work. Don't rewrite your talk for a 2nd eco department.  And don't try to show too much overlap with faculty in the dept.  Good departments are looking for complementary expertise.  10) #4 again: These sort of interview setups with short talks are common in the UK and Australia from what I've seen (NZ seems to be longer, but also varies). 11) @10 interesting, I had one interview in NZ but it was similar to US (I'm American). Maybe a column should be added to international comparisons tab? 12) #4: I've had two. One was similar to the US style interview, but the chalk talk was replaced by a mock lecture. The other was somewhere inbetween -  research talk including plans 30 minutes, teaching talk 30 minutes - and I was only there for one day. 13) @12, wow, I hope you were coming from within NZ or Oz, otherwise flying there for one day is brutal! 14) #4: Nope, flying from the US. Campus visit was one day, but they paid for my hotel for three nights, partly because there's only one flight per day from SFO to AKL and I had a connection. I stayed for a week. 15) @10, 11, 12 - I'm in Australia and our department always has hour seminars for job candiates. Just got an interview in US that states it is 90 min! (including questions). I have no idea how long of a talk to prepare. 16) @15 I'd ask the search chair for guidance, but my guess is the usual 45-50 minute research talk, then an extended Q&A about future research directions, etc.  But do ask, because this is unusual.","Withdrawing an application Has anyone ever had to withdraw an application due to a bad interview experience? If so, was it at the Skype or campus interview point in the process? I had a pretty brutal Skype interview last week that came with more than one pre-interview red flag making me question the professionalism of the people on the committee, followed by an interview by a committee that was apathetic at best. The idea of moving forward gives me a pit in my stomach, but I also know how tight the market is and wonder whether I should hold out and give the department a second chance should I make it to the campus stage. Or, if red flags are red flags and I should just cut my losses and save everyone's time now. 2) I once declined a campus invite after a skype interview that indicated to me that the impressions about the position I had developed from reading the ad were not accurate, and that I would not actually want the job. Granted Skype interviews are not a great way to evaluate anyone, but just be clear with yourself about why X was a red flag and honest about whether your experience is sufficient to indicate a real problem. I wouldn't worry about the market or anyone else's time. I don't regret it, still not settled but my work now is fine. 3) I also turned down a campus interview after a Skype that left me feeling bummed. One note--Skype interviews are terrible in general. If it was your first one, it could just be getting used to the horribleness that is a Skpye interview. 4) Not knowing specific details, I'd say don't rush to judgement. Sometimes campus interviews will give you a totally different perspective (better or worse). Skype or phone interviews are structured so they are exactly the same for all candidates due to HR rules. That can be rough on the committee too. 5) I called after a bad Skype and removed my name from a job interview. A couple people on the other end were awful. I was already in a tenure-track job, so it was definitely easier for me to pull my name. It was also easier for me to tell the committee that they didn't sound like a very happy department, and that's why I was pulling my application. If I didn't have a job, I probably would have stuck it out. Now that I've been at a university as a faculty member for over 10 years, I realize that most departments have those two or three people, and that the other people on the Skype were probably super embarressed.  6) Thanks folks. I'm still mulling it over. It was my second Skype interview and it couldn't have been more night and day from the first. The first (which was two years ago for the postdoc I'm in now) was very structured per HR rules, but the committee seemed interested in my answers, engaged with the interview process, lots of non-verbal cues like head nods and sometimes smiles that make you think you'd want to work with these people and they want to work with you. Last week's process was just about the polar opposite. This was in addition to a few minor flags that, were it not for the crappy interview, I'd probably just chalked up to things that aren't a big deal in the long run. This is my last open option for this cycle and my current position ends in the fall, which is why I'm still mulling. But if feet to the fire I had to make a call now, I'd probably say no thank you. The campus (should I progress) will have its work cut out to overcome last week's experience, as much as I would like to give the benefit of the doubt. Also, thanks #6 for the comment about every department has a few of ""those people"" ... I think they must have all been on this committee! yikes! 7) I've canceled for multiple reasons at multiple points - usually pulling packages pre-phone interview after accepting a position, but I've also turned down offers and twice I pulled out after accepting a campus interview (but before travel reservations were made), once because I accepted an offer and once to accommodate an interview I was more interested in. I can't think of any reason to turn down post-phone but before campus visit offer, and I definitely wouldn't advocate doing what #5 did - you never, ever know when your name will get around or who you'll end up working with. Why risk insulting someone to their face?? 8) Just my opinion - but why would you pull out???  You can always say ""no"" IF given an offer.  I wouldn't pull out at such an early stage in the game... you might either be pleasantly surprised, or minimally, you might get some good practice.  9) given your situation OP, I would say you should go ahead.  You could be surprised about the department, and if nothing else, it is a valuable experience to interview."
"posting your offer I wish those of us who have received offers would post on here that the position has been offered, even if it's still under negotiations. I've only received one offer and am anxiously waiting to hear back from other searches.  As soon as I was offered the position, I posted it. I realize everyone wants to be anonymous and secretive about the whole thing but it would save a lot of people some heartache to know that the sc's have made offers. Many of you probably disagree but this is MY venting post. Good for you and your offer. (2) Congrats on your offer. I promise to post any offers I receive. 3) Congrats! I didn't get an offer, but heard from the SC that the offer had been made (but not final) to someone else. I posted it. I don't see why anyone wouldn't.(4) For what job was this number 3? 5) I think those who use this site to fish for information and don't contribute are DOUCHEBAGS!! And, don't be so confident that we don't know who you are. 6) I agree with you 5 and, I know of at least 4 douchebags who troll the wiki and post no updates on their searches. Contribution is not required but it's courteous. Thanks to those job seekers who use this site and post updates. And curses to those who troll; I hope you get zero interviews, zero offers, and zero timely rejections. 7) As someone who hadn't yet posted an offer i received, I guess I'm a douchebag. i'm pretty comfortable with being a douche actually. I hadn't posted because I haven't decided what to do yet about the offer, there are some decisions to be made and rather than post something which doesn't actually have ANY meaning for anybody else yet I held off. There are only 2 other people affected by this - the other interviewees. Since I assume that if they're juggling multiple offers they will contact the SC rather than rely on the wiki, I figured I would hold off so that I don't communicate info that doesn't have meaning yet. It's not trolling, it's discretion - or being a douche, whatever. 8) #7, you don't know what knowing that an offer was made to someone means to the other interviewees. Why not let them decide the ""meaning""? 8) Why don't they contact the SC? At the stage of having been interviewed that's entirely appropriate. The wiki is useful when you probably can't get info on the process (i.e. at the stage of short-lists and scheduling interviews) after that there are only a few people involved and they can reasonably expect to get information from the SC rather than relying on the wiki. At the stage of interviews etc we don't get info from committees so sharing here makes sense, at the interview stage dealing with this professionally makes more sense. Is the point of the wiki useful information to help people make decisions or just gossip? This reaction does not exactly encourage me to post here. If the 'wiki' feels that people owe them information (before I've even told most of my family) I think that it will fail because it drives people away. The wiki is useful but is a little privacy in an incredibly difficult decision so much to ask?

9) I agree with with 5 and 6. If you use the wiki to find out whether positions have been offered then you should post when you get an offer. Simple courtesy. (10) Seriously? Really? Maybe when you accept an offer but just an offer? C'mon, Get over yourselves and have at least some respect for other people's privacy. If you interviewed, you should ask the SC and they should tell you. If you don't hear after a few weeks, take the hint. If you didn't interview at that place, WHY DO YOU CARE? (11) I agree with 10 and the second 8. People should not be villified for not posting an offer. It's nice to post interviews and other early updates on here, but once someone gets an offer, allow them some privacy.
9) This is not about privacy. No one is asking you to post your identity on here. Sure, we all try to be private and anonymous, but don't tell me that those of you who don't post, don't troll the posts to see who has updated info (including offers) for the positions for which you applied. It's pretty shitty for you to ""get yours"" without giving your fellow job seekers the ""reach around"". I agree with #9, it's simple courtesy. (10B) I TOTALLY understand people who don't want to post for whatever reason, but I think that this is EXACTLY why we should be posting offers - to get away from this freaky culture of secrecy that is really the root of most all that is awful about the job searching process. I got offers this year but still have NO IDEA what advice I could give a candidate next year because this whole thing was such a hush-hush black box! (12) 10 here. When you read comments made by the likes of 5 above, it is totally about privacy. There is some vindictive shit being said here about some fairly mundane details. I'm sorry if you were someone who didn't get the offer and that the person who did didn't take the time to immediately update the wiki because they had other things to consider besides informing those whom they beat for the job that they lost out. And an offer isn't the same thing as accepting the position. Y'all need to relax.
(13) I wouldn't expect anyone to potentially piss off their new colleagues by leaking info about their offer status. I've seen offers effectively revoked before an agreement was signed.
14) I wonder if 5 is referring to SC members or faculty. We're assuming that job candidates are the only ones who can post whether an offer is made. But, sc members, faculty, grad students and even admin staff may be on here posting or not posting info or digging for info. If you're wondering about your candidacy status, call the sc. If you want to post your offer, then post. Move on folks. 15) I am a little disappointed by this discussion. Is there any need to really call other people names (i.e., douchebags) on here? It makes us all look bad.(16) I really like the threatining language; Don;'t be certain we don't knwo who you are. Really/ Bring it! 17) Are we in elementary school? We are supposed to be professionals, so the language used on here does reflect badly on the community. (18) It is an open page, so yes, elementary school students could be posting here. If not, it likely explains the nature of some reviews I've received lately. Starting to make sense. (19) Oh, no! They DO know who I am! When my parents named me Anonymous User 251, they thought I'd be safe! But my identity is up for everyone to see! OH, NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Seriously, some of the posts on here crack me up. I don't even know which user I am on here (sorry for the identity theft, AU 251...I just picked one), so I'm pretty sure nobody else does. I post all of my stuff, but it's because I want to, not because I'm afraid of the ""Douchebag Police."" Seriously, 5, relax. 20) It is true that an anonymous elementary school student could be posting on here. That would explain #16's poor grammer. :) 21) 20 must be an undergrad. You mean grammar. 22) I believe 20 is referring to 16's poor impression of Kelsey Grammer. 22) 21: Of course it was not spelled correctly; that's part of the joke.
23) Some parts of the country ""don't do irony"".",San Jose State / Moss Landing ML Anyone know if the Ichthyologist search is going ahead? (1) Other Cal State searches seem to be. It'll be interesting to see if the money is actually there to make the hires in the current budget climate. (2) At least 2 biology cal state searches have been cancelled this year,NA,NA,NA,"So I'm wondering why public universities make salary information public, but not the list of candidates for jobs? I saw updates for some searches that said interviews were scheduled but the seminar page only listed, ""Job candidate talk 1"". Why don't they list the speakers???? There was one job I applied for that had ""Candidates will be made public"" in the ad.  some do, but in general I think its for the protection of themselves against attacks for interviewing less qualified individuals and to protect candidates from retaliation within their respective departments or attacks from other applicants.  maybe I'm over-blowing it! :) 2) OP, I don't know the universal answer, but in many (if not most) states, the salaries of state employees are public record by law, sinc they are paid with tax dollars.  There is no such law that job candidates must be made public, so I think out of respect for the candidates--many of whom may need their job search to be quiet or confidential--that information is typically kept private (which it should be).  Hence the warning in some searches that candidates may be made public. 3) #1 -- you are overblowing it and being a little cynical. With the exception of some spousal hires, why would schools interview less qualified candidates? There actually is little benefit to be gained by posting candidates. I doesn't help the school in any way. It also doesn't really help the candidates themselves and can even bring undo harm. The question I have is...why should a school list the canidates? I obsess about the competition as much as the next person but I don't see it as helpful to anyone in anyway. 4) Well it would be nice to know who else they were looking for, especially if you did a phone interview and didn't get the on campus interview. It would also be good to see how well the description fit the candidates. To 3, it's cathartic for me for one. This way I can look at their CV, see how poor a candidate they are, and then feel pity for the school that they didn't interview me instead! Some schools don't really think about this issue, and just add the candidate to their normal seminar schedule. I agree with 1 though that it would be nice to know. 5) #3 why would they?  Lets see, its called cronyism or the good-ole-boy system and happens all over.  I went to school with you, you have an advisee who needs a break, I give it to him/her. I've seen this half-a-dozen times. Or, how about, I earned my PHD ot Harvard have 2-3 pubs no grants and rode the coattails of my advisor, you went to North Dakota State have dozens of pubs including a few really good ones, grants out the butt, and you are a proven excellent teacher with a good personality.  IHowever, Whoknowswho College decides they want the Ivy League candidate for promotion purposes.  They can sell the Harvard grad to parents better than the NDSU grad, even though the NDSU grad is the over-all better candidate.  I've seen this twice.  Then there is the ""we will hire your phd grad and you hire ours so we can show students are getting TT jobs.""  I know of one case of this.  Oh, yeah, then, lets not forget the he/she will not stay here perspective, saw it too!  There is also the key committee member who wants a particular kind of candidate hired regardless of quality, and torpedos everyone else to get him/her.  Know of one case here, this one happened this year.  Then, there is the ""hire someone who fits into our lackluster productivity mold so that we do not get shown up"" routine.  Its more common than you want to believe.  I will not do so, but I could name names of schools and people, some of these examples are from committees i sat on as prof or student (no one cared that they were not following the process correctly).  Most are first hand observations while on committees or in the department.  The only thing about a search committee that works how you hope it would is that usually they hire someone.  Its hardly ever the person with the best research, teaching, or service potential/performance.  its usually the one the fewest people object too. 6) BTW, this isn''t a rant, 'K, guys? 7) #6 right, and its point on too.  8) In my experience, very little of what #5 says reflects reality, at least not at quality universities. ""First-hand observations""  = 'my perception the search process (and how it was rigged).'   Searches are complicated and there are always way more qualified candidates than can be interviewed.  And search committee members & faculty don't always agree.  Individuals may have some of the motives/ opinions listed by #5, but the process (and other faculty members) typically take care of this.  Candidates are largely evaluated on their record (regardless of where they earned their PhD), their perceived fit in the department,  how they interview, their potential for research and teaching.  The only things I have noticed (and I would wager I have more experience) is concern over whether candidate X will take the position or stay if they do, whether the university can provide them with appropriate facilities, enough colleagues, enough start-up etc.  But good universities go after the best candidates and work to put attractive packages together.  And they don't lose sleep over a failed search.   8) #7, you failed to see the point by qualifying ""quality universities.""  Guess what?  Quality went in the tank at most schools short of the top 50 decades ago. I guess you are probably referring to those few schools that are solvent, have faculty with time on their hands and all the resources they need.  THe rest of us wallow in less than perfect conditions asked to get milk from a stone and kill 5 giants with one blow.  If you actually believe that most schools are the balanced world of the premeir R1 and elite SLAC, then you live in fantasyland.  9) #5, bitter much? There are over 2,000 colleges and universities in the US, but apparently at all but the premier R1s and elite SLACS, faculty spend most of their time wallowing in something and being on the most dysfunctional search committees imaginable?  You certainly wallow in self pity, but please don't speak for the rest of us. Your generalizations make it clear you have no clue what things are like for many of us.  I am at an excellent MS University at the beach.  I don't make R1 money, but I got >>6 fig start-up, am in a vibrant department, and enrollment & quality of students improves every year.  I have outstanding facilities and excellent colleagues and grad students.  Sure, things could always be better, but way more is great about my job than is bad about.  Maybe you should take some responsibility for your own choices and performance instead of trying to deflate all of the bright, energetic people on the job market?   You are a very negative person who seems to want others to feel the same way.  Sorry, ain't gonna happen.  Only wallowing I do is in the sand.   My advice to those on the market: 1) Ignore Bozo; 2) bust your hump; 3) be determined and don't  start blaming others or buying into ridiculous conspiracy theories (use that time to publish instead).  4) do your homework on schools so that you make good choices when you do start getting offers; that decision can have a large influence on your career trajectory and options.  5) be proud of yourself and confident; you would not be where you are if you were not excellent at what you do. 6) constantly work to improve your CV, your speaking skills, and publish. 7) avoid negative people like #5... They will only drag you down.  ","Is it necessary to change the date updated and nothing else on a posting?  I'm all ""Oh is this one out for me?"" then ""wait, no, still just waiting..."" 2) Agreed.

Sorry if this is explicitly stated somewhere, but what exactly does the wording ""x2, x3, x4"" etc. mean?  I assume it means somebody has seen something posted, and they also encountered the same information independently.  For example: ""1) just got the hard goodbye for the job at the University of Heaven on 27 Jan. x3"" -- I assume that the x3 means that three additional people got the same email on the same day.  Correct? 2) yep, you are one smart cookie. 3) OP again (now I'm a regular). Thanks #2, not looking for positive affirmation FWIW -- I now know where to go for that ;^)  4) I am relatively new as well, in that I found this over the holiday break, but I like it mostly because of the supportive and helpful spirit.  I suspect that the general deterioration in feeling is at least somewhat related to the closing of this year's doors. 5) Agreed. ",I smoke marijuana. Seriously.,"Applying for a re-advertised job 1) I interviewed for a position in which I was not the candidate offered the job.  The last I heard from the search committee chair was that he expected it to be a failed search because he thought they wouldn't be able to recruit the person who received the offer and the dean would make them start over.  I received positive feedback about my candidacy.  Do you think that I should reapply?   2) It's worth a shot, but I wouldn't count on it. 3)Send the chair of the search committee a message and ask them directly. I suspect that they will be honest with you, and especially if they think it is not worth their time or your time.  4) Can't hurt, I saw the same person interview for the same-ish position twice in 3 years about a decade ago. 5) Just an update from #1 who asked this question.  I did reapply but didn't even get an interview invitation this time around.","AcademicJobsOnline is the worst website ever. Didn't realize that you have to update your application once the letters are submitted for it to be completed, I thought it just automatically updates it. Maybe this one is on me (stupid me!), but this doesn't change the fact that the website looks like shit and is hard to maneuver. 2) agree, had the same problem 3) Glad I'm not the only one who hates that site!  4) I also hate the site, but I think that as long as your letters are viewable when you click the employer's name (top line) then the application is complete and the letters are viewable to the employer. You can also click on the job title (second line) to change things or re-send the email to your letter writter. Am I missing something? 5) OP here - # 4 that's what I thought originally, but then was told that I needed to go to Status and click Update at the bottom of the page. Only when I did that (after the deadline, of course) did I get an email confirming that my application was complete. So I assume that it was incomplete (and invisible to the search committee) before, even though the letters were uploaded and all my info was in. 6) I think it updates automatically when the letters are sent. For example, if I hover next to the ""i"" near my application, it says my application was updated yesterday - though I didn't do anything, just the letter was sent. So I think it should be fine, it just keeps showing as editable for some bizarre reason. I agree, that platform is shit. 7) Had a heart attack reading 1-5, but I agree with 6-7 X2 8) OP again, I'm glad we got that figured out (even though I'm still not 100% sure what's the right way to go about that stupid website). But, there might just be many ways of doing it, and let's hope they all work well. 9) Related question: can the search committee still view an application on there that is missing letters? 10) Who knows, I suppose only the search committee can answer that. My guess is they can probably see it, but whether they want to consider it, is anyone's guess. 11) Did anyone else fail to send an email to letter writers b/c the site tells you when the last email reminder was sent, irrespective of the job applied for? I applied for multiple jobs on the same day via AcademicJobsOnline, and failed to specifically tell the system to email my letter writers for a particular job b/c the system told me it had just send them an email. I only discovered the problem when one of my letter writers, who's way on top of things, emailed me to tell me he had not received an email for that particular job. So my letters were all late even though I submitted my application early. Hate AcademicJobsOnline.","closing dates on non-TT page Oops - looks as though someone has messed up the closing dates for all the jobs on the non-TT page by sorting that column rather than sorting the page using that column as an index. Can anyone revert it? If not, should we clear the closing date column and leave it blank instead of inaccurate? 2) I think anyone can look through the File - Revision History to put it back in order. 3) Okay - largely fixed, though I think some might still be wrong 4) Thanks #3!","What's worse than the waiting?  2) the wait is over, The Last Jedi is in theaters now!  3)  I'm waiting to see it after Xmas, but I've read a lot of the spoilers and there are a lot not happy with it, but I'll judge for myself when I check it out.  Can't be worse than the prequels, right? 4) Please, no Star Wars spoilers on this wiki. As if this place isn't already depressing enough! x3 5) not worse than prequels, no. It's on par with the force awakens. 6) If its not episode 4-6 then it is garbage. 7) It's so fun, much closer to the spirit of the OT than the PT. Nice movie to take your mind off other things for 2.5 hrs 8) Such an outstanding movie, better than Force Awakes and the prequels. But I'm going to watch it several more times before placing it among 4-6. Take my opinion with a grain of salt though. I love everything Star Wars from movies, animated series, novels, and comic. Heck I even enjoyed the Holiday Special and always think of Life Day on Christmas morning :) 9) This has been the Life Day of Job Seasons for me, at least. Big expectations, followed by confusion, anger and finally despair. 10) @ #8, you even like the Bea Arthur musical number from the Holiday special?  ;) 11) @9 - hilarious analogy! @10 Bea Arthur is probably the second best thing about the Holiday Special, right after the first on-screen appearence of Boba Fett. 12) @11 did you erase my correction about Boba Fett?! 13) 11 here, no I did not #12, I assumed you did for some reason. But I did add ""on-screen"" to be accurate. I did not know about the parade - interesting bit fact that should be in Star Wars Trivial Pursuit!  14)  Yeah, I recall that Boba Fett made his first appearance in a parade, but will need to watch the Holiday Special again.  I've got a bootleg version of it on DVD.  Also have some awesome bootleg blu-rays of Episodes 4, 5, & 6 in their full, original thearetical form prior to Lucas bastardizing them with all the updated CGI crap.  That extra song and dance scene in Jabba's Palace is horrible!  Now, back to waiting for the e-mail or call from a prospective employer....  sigh 15) Yub nub, amirite?  16), Yub nub, indeed, ma boo-kee.  SCs no badda.  17) The Holiday Special was really a Thanksgiving special, not an Xmas special.  Common mistake.  And it's not worth watching...  It's not even so bad it's good; it's just plain terrible.  Listening to wookies grunt without subtitles for two hours is more mind-numbing than a cell bio seminar.  18)  Eek, nothing can be as bad as a cell bio seminar! x50  19) @17 Life Day includes trimming a tree with lights (Christmas tree), wearing red robes (Santa's robe), celebration of new life (birth of Jesus Christ), family members gather to celebrate, exchanging presents. But it was released in November so I can see how you would think it's a Thanksgiving special and not a Christmas special. By that logic, A Christmas Story is also a Thanksgiving special. 20) Life day transcends your puny Earth-holidays, rebel scum!  21) The Holiday special was released the weekend before American Thanksgiving in 1978.  It was a ""Holiday season"" special, but mainly Thanksgiving.   Life Day is about spending time with family, with no religious significance. 22) Forget about the references pointed out by #19, this is not the Christmas special you are looking for *waiving hand*. 23) You're going to find that many of the truths we cling to depend greatly on our own point of view. Some people interpret the Holiday Special as a Christmas Special, others believe it to be a Thanksgiving Special. 24) Seeing all the passion people have for the Holiday Special brings warm feelings to my heart.","What if I told you... potato Well, after some long years on the market, I finally landed a great TT position. This board has given me some really helpful insights, while also inducing many sleepless nights. I’ll stay  involved on the board to help pay it forward, but I think my most valuable contribution will always be posting the potato job (for those of you that are old enough to remember). For my  first job search, I intend to ask our department if we can afford to fall behind in the field of potato biology. What are some the most obscure postings you have seen? 2) Heard through the grapevine of one a bit before my time for a cranberry physiologist. 3) I remember you! Did you finally land a potato job? 4) Congratulations potato poster!! 5) Did the potato job ad have tomatoes as the background for some reason?

I like to know if they're contacting references so that I can remind my references to submit the letters. 3) One of my referees has a very strict timeline for submitting LOR and they ask me to let them know which places I'm applying to ahead of time. There's one place that automatically requested LOR and I didn't get a chance to let them know and they gave less than two weeks for submitting the letters, which is less than the time that my referee needs. It's annoying, I know it's not my fault, but still annoying.  4) I don't want to apply to positions that don't make a short list before requesting letters. It's a waste of everyone's time. 5) #4, then you are excluding yourself from more than 50% of jobs out there. Most positions (annoyingly) automatically request letters. 6) @4 are you serious? Why would you do that to yourself? I think most people who write letters have a basic understanding of how the system works, and aren't overly bothered by the requests. I don't understand why you would exclude yourself from so many jobs for this reason. 7) I used interfolio this year, each of my writers wrote one letter and I applied to about 40 jobs. I have had four interviews so far and still waiting to hear about 11 jobs. I was a little scared that I wouldn't get any interviews, but it turns out I am doing a little better than last year, so far. I wanted the job-search system to be better and easier, so I made the choice to do things differently, knowing the potential negative consequences. Maybe some jobs didn't like recieving letters from a dossier service, but if that was the case, would I really want to work with them the rest of my life anyway? I suppose I could have also had writers upload different letters with different emphases: teaching, research, or a mixed bag. Anyway, just thought I would let you know my experience in case you were thinking of doing it differently next year. 8) I sit down every Sunday and write an email that has all the jobs I'm applying to that week and what they're asking for in terms of upfront letters and send that to all of my letter writers. It seems to work out well enough.","Date formats on the job page 1) There's a mix of mm/dd/yyyy and dd/mm/yyyy which makes sorting difficult (unless I've missed a trick). It is probably too late to matter, but would it be possible to do more to enforce one specific format next year through the input form? I realise that it specifically asks for dd/mm/yyyy already, but I guess that's easy to overlook if you're used to mm/dd/yyyy 2) Where does the page have dd/mm/yyyy? It should all be mm/dd/yyyy. 3) When I click on ""Add Job"", the Google Forms input page asks me for the date in dd/mm/yyyy, but converts it mm/dd/yyy in on the Google Sheets page.  2) @3 Interesting -- could be that Google uses your localized settings, because it comes out as mm/dd/yyyy for me.  It doesn't look like I can change that.  AP 4) 3 here again - I think the localised format is for the Google Forms input page (occasionally it also displays the settings on those pages in my local language) as dd/mm/yyyy is the standard for me, so its interesting that Google changes it for that page, but not on the Google Sheets document (maybe it is fixed by the settings here?)","Which application year is it where you no longer give af? 2) Never, you always do. It's such a time investment that you really want your effort to pay off. x2 3) I find this feeling goes in and out EVERY year 4) The last one. 5) who has such a great postdoc/spouse/source of income that it's NBD if they get a job or not? Must be nice 6) Who said that? 7) Projecting 8) If anyone was that concerned about work they wouldn't be trying to get an academic job. 9) feeling that rejection season anger boil over eh  10) @5, I think you are reading someone else's frustration and hopelessness as confidence and privilege.  x3 @1, I think that only really happens for Full Professors.  ","Reimbursement Protocol  I recently returned from a cmapus interview, for which I paid for the flights out of my own pocket. No big deal. However when I asked about reimbursement it seemed like someone would be in contact with me about the process. I still have not heard anything, nor have I heard anything about the position (not unexpected considering the amount of time passed). Do I reach out about reimbursement? Do I wait a little longer? Unsure the correct ettiquette in this situation. 2) If it's been like 2 weeks I would definitely reach out. If two days maybe just wait a bit. 3) I'd reach out even if 1 hr if no one has told you anything about how the process works. Send the search chair an email that says, ""Greetings, I was just double-checking with you on the process to get reimbursed for my flight. Do I need to contact someone or will someone be contacting me?"" 4) I reached out re reimbursements within 24 hours from returning from an interview. Of course I knew who the admin person was to contact who would be handling it.So I just sent in the receipts. Also, yes big deal, you should not be fronting plane tickets for your interview. Grats you can float that money but many people are stretched to thr breaking point. 5) At my Uni, visiting speakers and prospective students also have to front their travel costs, then fill out a W-8 form. 6) so is having to pay for flights out of pocket and getting reimbursed later pretty common? I have just been asked to pay for flights for an interview up front, which I had no idea was common practice. 7) My three invited visits were always paid for up front. 8) 7- should I be worried if they are asking you to pay for your own flight? Should I try to ask them to pay for it instead? 8) Can you afford to carry that balance or afford to pay it off while waiting for reimbursement? 9) I can carry the balance for a short time; hopefully the reimbursement won't take too long. I am just really surprised they asked me to pay for it up front. 10) I'm on month 3 waiting for my reimbursement. But they are being communicative, and I only had to pay for a few small items (like airport travel) up front."

","interviewing while pregnant I realize that someone moved the federal jobs to the non-tenure tack bucket, but that is actually inaccurate.  After you work in the federal system for a year or two (depending on the vacancy) you are certified civil service, meaning you cannot be let go except for cause or if there is a major budget cut.  Thsi is much the same as tenure at the university only it takes less time and the jobs pay more.  Further, in several of these positions, the person has affiliation with a university, or can easily obtain it, to run graduate students or even teach a course.  So, you figure it out.  You have a job that takes 2 years to gain ""tenure"" compared to 6 at a university, largely pays >$10-20K more than a university system, and has internal grants that only you and 2-3 others can apply for.  So, tell me again why a university job is better? 2) The federal government is great if you like a lot of structure and being told what do to. There is a significant amount of bureaucracy at federal agencies that you will never encounter working at a university, and some of that can be an impediment to getting your work done. Also, at federal agencies you don’t normally get to choose what research you do, as those decisions are made based on the whims of the current staff or the desires of the agencies. When a new political party gets in power, your whole research focus could change based on their desires. You may be part of a larger team that works collectively to solve a problem, but that problem is not often up to you to determine. You mention getting grants but I think this is based on the agency. My spouse works for the federal government and they never have access to grants but have to go to their head if they need travel funds or want to hire a student. Normally, the funds for on-going projects are part of the budget that they get for the higher ups (and may be set years in advance). If that is cut, they have to figure out how to do with less. Also, a final thought, federal jobs are 9-5 and revolve around the calendar (you literally punch in and punch out). Academia has no such time table.  A lot of federal agencies are under a hiring freeze and can only apply for emergency positions. If you look at USAjobs you will find a lot of temporary positions but not as many full time positions that are proportional to universities. Many of the full time ones are open only to current federal employees, so you need to get your foot in the door at a lower level positions (e.g. post doc) before you can land one of the “permanent” ones. 3) Federal jobs are great, but maybe not appropriate for the tt or the non-tt page.  Maybe we need a new page for those?  1) Honestly, I was just calling attntion to them.  However, the declarations by #2 are largely misinformation in regresearchers who came out of mard to federal jobs, and supporting misinformation about university jobs.  My buddy at Larg Texas R1 is only allowed to work within a small slice of his field.  THis is so common its funny.  Now, I have several friends employed in fed research positions.  All have advised doctoral students, all apply for grants on projects they contrive and plan, and no one was telling them what to do.  IN some offices you do get crap supervisors who control your research.  However, in academia you get the same thing.  In academia you will get dead wood faculty who claim you do to much research and do not devote enough time to your classes despite your students being better educated at every level and by every metric available.  So, you will meed morons in all walks of life.  The biggest difference in this regard between academia nad government is that government managers tend to move all over, so you can count on the jerk leaving within a year or two, and if he/she does not, you can move through internal transfers.  However, if you are in academia, make tenure, and a chair is hired who is a worthless moron, or you have to deal with a group of faculty who largely like to cause trouble for others (they exist in many many universiteis), then you are stuck with the A-Holes for the next 30 years unless you are fortunate enough to get hired elsewhere, and in this job market good luck with that!  My buddy who works in the upper midwest government lab of the USGS used to work for a state university in California.  I asked him how he felt.  He said it was the best move he ever made, better pay, more freedome, the same politics.  Then, my other friend was director of the LA Wetlands center for ages.  HE left academia, again for much higher pay and better opportunities.  So far, I know far more people who left academia for gov and stay than the opposite track.  also, those who leave tend to go back to gov.  alot of it is funding opps.  several of my friends came out of UCberkley etc.  Some positions are more flexible than academia.  OThers are very rigid.  Generally unless you are in the smithsonian or a COOP, your research will mostly be applied.  There are quite a few physical scientists who are in teh National Academy and never spent a day as an academic researcher, all govt.  However, biology tends to be far more applied in nature (USFS, USFWS, NIH) and traditionally these areas would not get you into the academy if you were in academia either.  So, take it for what its worth.  I just think we should add a tab that is permanent nonacademic (govt/consulting/zoos/etc.).  Many who come here are completely unaware of these opportunties.  They are just as hard to get as academic jobs though, its just does your resume translate better to one of these than to academics?  That is key. I just added a tab for non-academic jobs, WTH.  Feds, consultants, state, whatever can be posted here and if anyone else hears about them, they can post info.  4) Thanks-this is great!!! I really like the idea of this tab. Of course, this means that I will continue to check the wiki after this job season and that can't be good for my productivity (but would love to see what is out there!) 5) All you do is get on, check wht you check and move on.  IF you do that, it won't mess with productivity.  IF you spend hours gazing at it as if mesmerized by a spector, you will self destruct. ",Regular exercise regime.,deadlines ,"Got a phone interview at a SLAC, but there are some red flags compared to the others I've interviewed with... they stated a start-up package figure (which is unusual) in the initial email, but a follow-up email two days later gives a figure that is $10k less with no explanation. I haven't asked about start-up, nor am I expecting much, but this situation feels strange. Plus, last minute scheduling and no info on who I should be expecting to speak with. I'm wondering if this is just a poorly run search or a big red flag.

I won't ask you to say here, but please make sure you update the entry on the faculty-jobs page 3) nah I'm going to go ahead and ask - which school? 4) Sounds like either disorganization, a mispeak, or negotiation tactic to get to that initial figure you heard. Probably disorganization.","Fronting costs My finances look great once you account for the >$7000 I'm owed by universities!  That's 10-20% of a pdoc salary. If you're a search chair or dept head, fronting the airfare costs for candidates (rather than reimbursing after) goes a long way.  Even if a candidate doesn't have tons of interviews, they probably have conferences and other constraints.  It's especially hard if all the checks haven't come in before a big cross country move. 2) Amen! 3) I only wish I'd been invited to enough interviews to owe $7,000 and humblebrag about it. Seriously though, that is really annoying, but congrats on all the interviews!  1 again) Nah, that's conferences, interviews, and others.  Interviews aren't the only thing, but they add to the total in a serious way.  There are usually easy ways for universities to take care of that pressure for job candidates. 4) yea, sounds like a humblebrag to me.  Funny story: year and a half ago I suddenly owed my uni more than $40k.  Reason: incompetent admin accidentally added an extra zero to my paycheck, and for various reasons it was already going to be my largest paycheck of the year.  25% of my startup gone in one month's salary to myself (since half was taxes), and if I didn't report it, nobody was going to notice!  5) I'm up to about $1600 for interviews and conferences, which is just sitting on a credit card.  I feel your pain but I certainly would not be able to handle $7K. 6) Ease off on criticizing for humblebrag. We're all making crap salaries, and no one should have to have $7K in debt for their work (x3). 7) Is this in the US? I have never front anything before in all my interviews. 5 again) yes, I'm in the US. x2 8) My interview was in November and I still have not been reimbursed for my plane ticket (and no offer.. haha)! 8) Not just US. I had to buy my plane ticket from US to UK and have them reimburse after the interview. Same with a previous interview in Sweden.","Applications are a numbers game' which means you need to apply to like 40 jobs or more.

I just want to write in my cover letter 'I will have your damn letters sent if I make it to a point that you need letters.' It is such a ridiculous and inefficient system and I am convinced it is designed to to be that way.  2)  Shit, I've been looking for a new job for at least the last five years and probably apply to about 10-12 jobs/year, so when I finally accept an offer and move, I'm making sure they all get awesome thank you gifts. 3) Agree 100%.

A lot of it is just inertia from the way things have always been done, except that historically people were not applying for 100's of jobs. The whole thing is very specific to the culture of the field too. Some other fields within academia that have a tradition of sending lots of applications have much more of a 'check the box and send a cv' application process. Imagine how much time it would save everyone if you just sent a cv in the first round. SC's could go on to request more material from the 10 or 20 or whatever applicants, but in many cases that would save hours of time for hundreds of applicants and almost a thousand letter writers just from a single search. People on SC's will respond with various reasons they don't/can't do this, but other fields and jobs DO make hiring decisions like this, so really it is a problem of inertia. 4) I've bitched a lot about this whole process on this page, but I think SCs need as much info as they can up front so the few times they get to meet they can make informed decisions. It's a huge pain the ass, but seriously even though I've apologized and thanked, there is no need to do so after a certain point. none of my letter writers have complained and they consider it part of their jobs to help their current and former underlings to thrive (in or out of academia). They want to see you applying to 40 jobs/year. Tweaking a letterhead for the address of a different institution and uploading to Interfolio is probably the easiest part of their job. 5) PI here. What #4 said. Writing reference letters for my current and former mentees is part of my job (a pleasant part--I want to see my current and former mentees succeed!). And once I've written the first letter for someone it's no big deal to resend it to other places. FWIW, I know many PIs who feel the same, and don't know any who feel otherwise.","Mailing in? For the first time in my job search journey, I am applying for a job that requires that material be MAILED in, not e-mailed. This is for one of the Hawaii jobs, and it has me feeling nervous about reciept of my materials. Would it be weird to *also* email the package to the search chair?  2) Is it a job with a start date of Sept. 1, 1983? 3) @2, it feels like it! It makes me wonder if there is an internal candidate - and they are making it as hard as possible to apply. 3) Or if a department is that behind the times, if you really want to end up there... 4) I definitely want to end up in Hawaii. I'll give it a shot, haha. 5) Before you think Hawaii is the ideal place for you, you should know that attrition within the UH system is fairly common, especially for young faculty. Many people think it is a worry free paradise and happily take a job but then realize the cost of living is very high, you are stuck on an island with a lot of other people, finding collaborators can be tough and travel can be expensive. It can be especially hard if you are single and not on Oahu as the dating pool and extracurricular acitivities can be limited on the outer islands. 6) OP here, I'm familiar with the shortcomings,  having done my Masters field work on the big island. Succeeding there really depends on the type of person you are and what you value. Hopefully everyone that applies would be well aware of their own needs and the nature of living there. Personally, I do consider it paradise. 7) Weirdly, one of the first faculty positions I ever applied to requested that the application be mailed. A friendly faculty member (may have also been the SC Chair?) there told me it was a strategy they used to specifically limit the number of applications they recieved. It was in Canada and I'm in the US, and it was impressively slow and expensive to get my application there via FedEx. So I asked if I could email it also, and he said that was fine. 8) I was wondering! Verrrry interesting 9) ",Waiting blows. 2) Sure! But think of everyone else waiting on an interview opportunity,"Differentiating between SLACs What is the best way to distinguish between a teaching-oriented SLAC and a SLAC that expects an extra-murally funded research program, albeit conducted with undergraduates? Whether they ask for a research statement or not must be a factor. The teaching load required must also be different, but I'm not sure what the cutoff is. 2) Very rough rule of thumb: a SLAC at which the teaching load is 1 lecture + 1 lab per semester expects high research output. A SLAC where the load is, say, 3 lectures + 3 labs per semester does not. You could also look up the publication records of the current faculty to get a sense of what's expected. You could also gauge it roughly by crude measures of institutional reputation. A ""elite"" SLAC like Williams College probably expects higher research output than a non-""elite"" institution. 3) Note that very few SLACs will expect large grants in terms of a tenure decision. PIs at teaching colleges just aren't able to get those grants except in rare circumstances. Sure, at a school like Williams this would not be out of the ordinary, but still not a requirement for tenure. In fact, if you get an interview at a SLAC you will probably need to convince the SC that you can do your research without large grants. 4) One thing I would look for is ""research with undergrads is encouraged"" or something along those lines. My school uses this language to show that we appreciate the effort, but that it is not required. We have heavy teaching loads, which is why we don't require research, so I agree that looking at the teaching loads of faculty will help (though I know of 3/3 load schools that still expect good publications for tenure; our teaching loads are in the 2-3 lectures with labs per semester range for reference) 5)  OP here.  Thanks for the input!  I'll have to familiarize myself with the rankings for SLACs.","Anyone else see job talk advice about preparing months in advance and practicing like 20x, when in reality all we have is maybe ~2 weeks notice that we will get a campus invite? Hard to reconcile the job advice I see on some websites with the reality of how much notice to prepare we actually get, and it makes me nervous! 1) I think most people probably have a good idea of what they are going to put in a job talk and take materials from other presentations they have likely given multiple times. It's a matter a tweeking a few things to make it work for that particular institution (which you probably already thought of for research and/or teaching statements). 2) Agree, unless it is a pui with a specific teaching/lecture prompt as a job talk, your presentation will be similar from job to job, it does suck if you are doing it for the first time and only have a week or two to get it ready, but if you have done one, you will have a good base to start with. ","Planning Research as Faculty I just finished my first gig as search committee member.  When we were doing the interviews, there was one major factor that determined whether candidates were viable or not.  We asked them to outline the first experiments they would do as faculty and why they mattered.  Can you describe the goals of your first experiments?  Can you explain how those goals relate to the broader impacts of your work on the scientific communities.  Some candidates, especially junior ones, did not have well formulated plans for a single experiment.  They could not describe controls or the beginnings of statistical analysis.  Some were slower to describe the importance of their work, but were able to articulate these goals with some prompting.  Others could not related experiments back to the bigger question even with some guidance to do so.  Many of these candidates looked excellent on paper and have exciting research with their advisors.  Explanation of experimental design was the single factor that made candidates non-viable to move forward.  Take some time to write out 1-2 experiments and a paragraph describing significance.  You don't need to know whether you'll be doing a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test on the data or a Wilcox test, but you do need to know what the control is.  After that, there will be politics and preferences about who is ranked at the top.  But we all want to do everything in our power to stay on the list of viable candidates.   I hope that's helpful to people. x2 2) Very good advice. Most likely your colleagues are not going to care that much about what you have already done (in detail)...they are much more interested in what you want to do next. 3) Of course this is good advice but I would suggest that if this is what you wanted to judge your candidates on you should have told them that explicitly before they came for the interview. Just because some people have particularly prepared for this (or similar, see below) questions does not mean that others couldn't have better answers if they had happened to prepare that answer or had been prompted to know it would be important. Once again, this rewards people for thinking on their feet in a way that is not required for a successful academic career. No one asks you to write grants, papers, or provide feedback on written work off the cuff.   1)  I agree that hiring based on surprise questions is not a good idea.  I'm not privy to exactly what the chair sent interviewees, but our job ad and the written statements made it clear they needed to be prepared to tell us about future research.  We tried to prompt applicants if it appeared they missed parts of questions, as good hiring committees do not want to lose good candidates over arbitrary criteria.  We discussed the candidates that needed more prompting or were less polished. We tried to distinguish these from people who simply could not answer.  No scientist should be blind sided by asking about experimental design. New faculty should be able to tell us what the control is, what data they would collect, and what comparisons they would make.  Anyone who cannot tell us design of a single experiment after writing 2-5 pages on future research is likely to struggle with leading a lab.  They should certainly be able to give better answers about experimental design than the undergraduates in my classes. Some hiring committees have members who are looking to stroke their own egos at candidates expense.  Hopefully you can find others who are genuinely trying to find the best candidates they can for future research. 4) I think for research intensive university job, having a reasonable idea of your next couple years' work and being able to describe it is a fairly standard expectation....5) just out of interest was the shortlist selected based on ""famous adviser"" or ""high ranking uni degree"" because in that case I wouldn't be so surprised (yes, I'm feeling salty today) 6) This thread emphasizes something that a lot of candidates could learn from. The research statement should not read as if your selling your abilities based on past accomplishments. It should focus on what you want to do going forward, while making appropriate connections to what you've already found. And each statement should be written to match the specific institution (specific references to field sites or labs). Those get viewed much more favorably than something generic. 7) I know someone who was a finalist but got dinged for a situation like that described here and did not reeive an offer. They went on to be highly successful at a very similar school. While I appreciate the advice, given here in an amicable manner, I think it's also worth assessing whether this criteria is remotely predictive. I can think of several reasons why it may not, yet I would also not be surprised if it indeed was predictive. Alternatively, why not ask for finalists to submit a brief written document to these questions? 8) I might be a bit confused as to what the question here really is. Most of the jobs we're talking about are meant for scientists who are going to be conducting research as a major part of the job. I'd venture that successful scientists virtually will always have their next experiment or two planned out with at least some degree of specificity. Your colleagues are going to want to know what you are planning to do...and how it fits with the institution. 7) No, not necessarily if put on the spot during an already stressful interview. There are a variety of reasons a successful research candidate may not be able to give an quick answer to that question, especially if they don't know it's coming. What might seem an obvious line of questioning may not be obvious to the candidate. It may be an informative line of questioning, but if so, why not have finalists submit short answers outlining that so the entire committee can consider the answer they give in writing? If it's a matter of taking well-qualified individuals and ending their chances of having a career at your institution, that's a momentous decision. I'd want to make sure productive scholars weren't sent packing for a momentary lapse. 8) Also these 'obvious' questions are often asked in subtly different ways by different schools or different members of the search committee that might make your well prepared answer not very useable without a lot of on the fly editing. That can come off as unprepared. Not sure what kind of position the OP was talking about, but these specific/tailored plans are also a lot harder to have really well developed if your work depends on local field sites that have different species/habitats at different university locations as opposed to a lab based research program that might have the same set of next steps at any university regardless of the location. 9) Whether you agree or not with the criteria for selection by the OP's search - it is valuable feeback... as many search committees will ask this very question. 10) Umm, talking about your future research is what a chalk talk is all about, I know not everyone has these in their interviews, but they're still fairly common for a large number of jobs posted here....... 11) Bombing a chalk talk and losing out on a job was the tough lesson I needed to make sure my future plans were a part of every application and interview moving forward.  Next interview turned into an offer. 12) @10.. and if there is no chalk talk scheduled (like many places)?  The answer to the question ""what will your first grant proposal address?"" should flow out of one's mouth naturally.  x2 13) I don't think anyone in the thread above is questioning whether the OP's advice is good given how interviews actually work, the questions raised above are about whether performance in answering this genre of questions in an interview situation is actually predictive of performance in the role of professor and whether it favors certain personalities at the expense of actually selecting candidates who will do the best research/teaching/advising/grant-writing/service. It should be both possible to consider what the best advice for current applicants is while also examining the ways that faculty searches function--for good or bad. I do think there is a real possibility for a disconnect with these kinds of impressions. Its analagous to the evaluation of baseball players by scouts vs. sabermetricians. The whole academic interview really emphasizes the ability to 'look like a professor' (e.g. https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/04/08/what-baseball-teaches-us-about-measuring-talent). Of course academia doesn't have the same easy to measure performance outcomes that baseball does so evaluating later performance is a real challenge and it doesn't seem like there is much interest in even trying to do it. 14) Academia isn't bloody baseball. 15) You're right, the hiring practices are worse. 15) No doubt academic hiring is freaking awful, but I dunno did @15 go out for MLB or something? Point is these comparisons are bonkers."
"Not your ""ideal"", but good enough for now? I'm curious if others are thinking about the danger of taking a job that doesn't fit your ideal (i.e too much teaching, low salary, low start-up etc) but is a job in a very tough market. I just got invited for an interview and they stated salary, start-up and teaching up front, all of which are quite unappealing. However, as we all know the market is miserable and if we have spent some time as a post-doc already, the idea of another is also pretty daunting. This is all academic still, but I wonder if we take one of these less than ideal positions are we completely ruining any chance of moving somewhere better? If so, what else could we do in the meantime? Which is better, another post-doc or a mediocre position? Perhaps even something else... Make a list: write down the worst case scenario factors that you'd be willing to accept (e.g., lowest salary (given geographic location), lowest start-up, max teaching load, distance from family, # of bars in the city, lone ecologist conditions, etc.) write everything down. Then, write down your best case scenario, ""dream job"" qualities. Your decision will ultimately depend on how low you're willing to go. I did it for an offer I received a year ago and decided to decline it. I'm a year into my 3rd post doc in a cool city, near family, and earning ""ok"" money. I've had 3 campus interviews so far (still waiting). I'll also say that I got feedback from my advisors and other seasoned faculty about the first offer last year. The consensus was that if the position didn't at least meet my threshold criteria, then it's best to not accept it. 
2) If you can land a good postdoc with someone doing cool work and learn some new skills, then you should do another postdoc instead of getting stuck in a sub par, potentially miserable, position. It's just not worth it. It won't be impossible to leave a crappy position but it can be close to it. Also, it's an outright disservice to the department if you accept with the intention of leaving. 3) I agree with #2. Trying to leave a crappy job now, and finding it difficult. A good, productive post-doc may be a better option than a job below your minimum criteria. 4) My advisor (who has worked at a handful of schools and been promoted to chair at each of them, so I figure he knows something about the system) told me that I've got about 5 years after my degree (or last postdoc or whatever) to switch jobs before it looks like I'm running from a failed tenure bid. However, 2 and 3 have good points: it is basically screwing your dept to have an exit strategy already in place and the market sucks. Can you find a better job, or will you be stuck longer than you planned? 5) OP again, thanks everyone for the advice, all good thoughts. I agree with all of what you said and think it is probably better to wait for something more acceptable. I have some confounding factors, though, that make finding another post-doc not so easy. Specifically, after traveling around for a few years for my post-docs, my spouse's boss has called him back and we figure it is important to stay here until I find something permanent and we can negotiate a more permanent remote situation for him. I have several papers I can get out over the next year and I will keep my official post-doc appointment for the next year, but as of a couple of months ago, I am ""self-funded"". I'm not sure I can make it another year without a salary. So, if the only offer I get this year is unacceptable in terms of salary, start-up etc, do I just moonlight or something to bring in dough while I finish up papers from my last post-doc, try to find something else, try to find any old post-doc in the area... Ugh. 6) #3 again. I faced a similar situation with postdoc funding gone, and wish I hadn't taken the first offer of hard money - hold out as long as you can, and keep searching.

7) Don't do it. If you've received an offer once this year, you'll probably get one or two next year, especially with a better cv. Don't feel like accepting this one job is your only option. It can be very miserable and taxing on you to try to be in a position that is even somewhat below your minimum criteria. That aside, it's not only very difficult to leave but the costs are much higher, on many levels (e.g., a mortgage, kids' schooling, grad students, spouse's career, spousal guilt, etc.) If you can hold out in a way for a better position, do it. Don't settle! (8) I would consider it . I think the important thing to do is to gauge your potential to get out successfully, IF, the job turns out to be less than ideal. What seems to be critical are the obvious, grants and pubs, if you can keep getting these things out, then by all means you should consider it. A postdoc will offer the benefit of being able to devote your time to getting the latter, at the cost of knowing it is temporary, and still getting paid less than whatever faculty position you are considering. Every faculty member I know, started at one location and moved on. 

9) I agree with some of the points made by 8 but I'll add that getting out of a crappy position smoothly is very rare. I too know of many faculty who started at one location and moved on but, their transitions were very difficult. Like poster 7 states, there are just so many unforeseen costs, both academic and personal, to leaving a crappy position that it's generally not worth it or the loss of time and productivity. I'd rather do another postdoc than to be stuck and go through even a year of crappy work conditions. 10) Your crappy position in a place you hate with too low salary, no start up, or too much teaching may be someone else's dream job, because it's the location they always wanted, they do inexpensive research, or they love to teach. Removing yourself from searches for jobs you don't actually want seems only fair to the people who do want it.
11) TT assistant prof here. I've been in my current position for 2 brokenhearted and miserable years. I'm currently looking to leave and it's been tough. When I accepted this position, I knew that it did not fulfill my ideal expectations but I thought I could make it work and didn't rule out leaving. So I accepted. The pay was (is) decent. My start-up was even pretty good And the teaching load as decent too. But my work environment, admins, other faculty, and even the students were (are) what made this position unbearable for me. I sincerely regret accepting this position. In retrospect, my postdoc was great and before the offer, I was planning on another postdoc with a collaborator. My point here is that I wasn't desperate, I had good options. Also, I really couldn't foresee how horrible my future faculty members were, how isolating it was to be the only organismal EEB person there, how lazy, unmotivated, and uninterested the students were, and how unorganized and unsupportive the administration was. I saw hints of these things during the interview but no where near the magnitude of how things really were. So, I'm leaving but as others here have commented, it's going to be very costly. It's extremely difficult to be on the job hunt (again!) while teaching, serving on all kinds of committees, writing, mentoring (trying to), doing research!, and having a decent personal life. Another thing I'll say is: If you have any doubts about a position you accept, DO NOT BUY A HOUSE. Wait a year or two. You don't want to be stuck with a mortgage while trying to leave. So, the offer might seem decent or even great in terms of salary, start-up and teaching but don't forget about the social factors. Ultimately, I think we all want a collegial environment. I recommend you give this factor more weight in your decision process. Good luck. (12) No. 11, you are not in the SW by chance are you?  ","length of package ha ha ha.  Nice one.  Seriously, I've always wondered if very concise applications were on average better recieved than overly long and broad ones.  There is a variety of opinion out there, but my guess is that a 2 page limit is probably a good idea.  Also, how much do those of you that did get an offer/accept restate past research versus offer a forward looking research statement?  Was this based on past work or an entirely new venture.  I'm in the EU and it is different here, more focused on describing your future research program, to the point where you actually do write up a research proposal.  It is actually not that bad an idea. If your package is less than 6 inches, I wouldn't bother submitting it to the SC. (2) Dude, it's not the length, it's the application. (3) I think concise and informative is better (short and broad -- not so much), plus many SCs have a 2 page maximum (4) A good research statement integrates past work and future directions into a cohesive research program. And no matter how much text you have, make sure there are some pictures. (5) Pictures? seriously? (6) It's called ""humor"". Look it up. (7) I thought 4 was serious about pictures too. In chemistry they have lots of pictures of structures and such in their research statements, so I've often wondered if biologists like myself who work with less well-known organisms (i.e. inverts that people might not be familiar with) should include pictures. (8) #4 again. I was serious. The old cliche is true: a picture is worth a thousand words. They will catch the eye of someone going through a large stack of applications, and might make the difference between your statement being read or ignored. (9) No offense, maybe it's worked for you, but I think it would make the difference between your statement being read or being passed around to be ridiculed by the entire SC before being set aside. I think pics would be viewed as fluff or filler, just like they generally are in a job talk (although pics as fluff or filler can be appropriate for a talk). I guess if you study a particular behavior or trait that is hard to describe and can insert a good picture of it, then maybe, but I don't know that I'd take pics seriously in a written statement. Just my opinion. (10) Okay, now I'm convinced. The research statement should be made as bland and boring as possible. (11) Seriously #9? Everyone I talked to who has served on search committees told me to definitely put pictures in my statement. Though, maybe your field is not as visual as mine; I have very few fluff pics in my talks - mostly conceptual illustrations and data. (12) 9 here.  Maybe there's a miscommunication here...when I saw ""pictures"" I took that to mean photographs (eg, a cute picture of a mouse or bunny) which everyone I have talked to who has served on SCs considers to be fluff or filler in anything job-related other than a powerpoint.  Conceptual diagrams or data figures can certainly be appropriate and helpful, although I still don't think your statement should be overloaded with them.  I just think of them as ""diagrams"" and ""figures"" not ""pictures.""  My mistake, if that's what people have meant all along.  Although, based on the responses of 5 and 6 to 4, I don't think I'm alone in my interpretation.  I certainly hope no one here needs to rely on pictures to avoid having their statement be ""bland and boring.""  (13) Sorry, I (#4) did mean figures/diagrams. That, and photos of your dog wearing a tutu. (Last sentence = ""humor"") (14) 9/12 again.  Slightly off topic, I'm starting to think that, based on several posts on this page and several more on the venting page, we should start putting labels on sentences that are supposed to be humor.  I know it's hard to get tone from text like this but, wow, there have been some real problems lately.  Good job, 4/13 ;)",NA,NA,NA,"I thought this article might be important for those of you considering jobs in Illinois.  the current bill that just passed is a big travesty, and don't expect the courts to over-rule it because of political ties.

Illinois legislature OKs fix for $100B pension crisis  (http://www.sj-r.com/article/20131203/NEWS/131209880/?tag=3).  1) There's not a whole lot one could negotiate about pensions.  Also, this is a trend in many states where it is  encouraged for faculty to forgo the pension and opt instead for the guaranteed contribution plan administered by a private investment firm.  Encouragements include a much shorter period to become vested, 1 vs. 6 years and larger employer contributions.  It's a tough call if you don't know if you'll spend 6 or more years in your current job--who knows the first week of new employee orientation if you'll be lucky to get tenure and then be happy in that place for the rest of your life.   I have to ask myself how many faculty starting out now will be as lucky as faculty currently retiring with nice SS and pension benefits.  2) sure there is. You can negotiate higher pay because of the loss of pension support. However, your points are good though! 3) you can't negotiate a salary high enough to offset it--you are talking just a few thousand here and there in today's dollars.  And they can counter that the retirement plan isn't really gone, you are just given the 403b guaranteed contribution plan.  4) $1,000 will added to your salary today is $1710 added to your salary in 10 years, assuming you get 5% raises on average over that period and no additional raises for promotion.

Strongly prefer the format.","Phone needs to ring!!! 2) I think my phone and email account are both broken! 3) That must be my problem... 4) Mines been broke for 3 years, I haven't been able to figure it out :)","Iowa If you get an offer from a public university in Iowa, make sure you are getting 'tenure' or 'tenure track' in your offer letter. The state appears to be moving to strike tenure, generally. https://www.legis.iowa.gov/legislation/BillBook?ga=87&ba=SF+41  2) Checkout Missouri too, there are bills in the legislature. 3) Little chance that the bill in Missouri would pass as written. Just another one of Rick Brattin's stupid submissions.  4) I don't think it will survive this time either, but as more and more midwestern states have budgeting issues and fewer and fewer federal dollars flowing to their states and universities (because of the politicians people in these states elect), I bet you'll see more and more attempts to 'solve' the funding issues at state universities, by emphasizing tuition dollars over research dollars, and devising methods to hire faculty on the cheap and silencing their opinions and influence. 'Oh, you're earning $90k but 'just teaching one class on evolutionary biology of climate change', let me get rid of tenure, fire you, then rehire you for $30k to teach something important like microbiology for nursing students.' (No disrespect meant toward nusring or microbiology).  5) its all a ploy, the rich take over, remove rights and privileges, and we return to surfdom. ","Who has it worse: the SCs having to leaf through scores and scores of applicants or the hungry applicants who have to complete scores and scores of applications? I say applicants - they don't have a job yet, they are beholden to their current labs if they are postdocs, and possibly wasting hundreds of hours on job apps that should be going to their research. Whose research does not take a productivity hit during job season? Therefore, having to make a detailed case to SC in the opening documents is unfair. I don't think it's too much for SCs to do a little legwork and decide what CVs fit their search. I understand applicants need to make a good case as to why they fit in but it's a dicey game. You could easily piss off a SC member ('why didn't they pick me'), potentially offsetting any merit that's listed in your CV and statements. 2) Stakes are higher for applicants - any one job could change their trajectory moreso and any one SC hire; Time consumption is higher for applicants - any one job application takes ~ one hour, not counting initial material production (~ 10-20 hours). Most people apply to 20-40 jobs a year, thats 50-60 hours, not including corraling people for letters, responding to SC bullshit statements like 'mission' and 'diversity' letters, interview time...etc; Emotion is higher for applicants - wading in the cesspool that is this venting page, constantly getting rejected, passed over, and generally shit on, while working their ass off for little money. There are few stakes in serving on SC beyond some time committment, working with people you hate, and potentially hiring someone you don't want to run in to at the coffee cart. 3) Right so why do I have to spoon-feed these supposedly genius faculty members about what they want or don't want in the department? You can read! 4) Personally, I think it is ego-stroking. The Uni crowd *not always* believes that their situation is somehow unique - their undergrads, curriculum, research program - are somehow special. You can see this reflected in the various 'SC venting' posts on this page, where SC members sound off on cover letters nottaking the time to address their special situation. TLDR: they think *not always* that they are special and they want to know if you are going to come in thinking they are special too. 5) to OP, having been on both sides of the table, I understand what you are saying. All I want to say is that this is a numbers game. You are competing against other people. There are hundreds of applications and 3-4 people to invite for on-campus interviews. If you dont make a detailed case, scores of other people will. The folks who took the effort are the ones who will be rewarded with a skype or on campus interview. 6) OP here: of course, that's why I'll keep doing it, and then coming to this page to vent about it. Interesting though: on every phone interview this year I have been asked why I fit into the department. Uhh, didn't you read the application you instructed me to write? 5 again) Hope you get lots of interviews! Happy holdiays.  7) #4, it's not always about SCs thinking that their uni is ""special"".  It's usually about finding someone who meets a particular need of the department.  If you can't be bothered to tell the SC how you meet their needs, isn't that really your problem not theirs?  (Also, don't ever apply for an Australian faculty job... You have to write an entire document in addition to the cover letter explaining how you meet every single one of their enumerated search criteria.) 4) Ummm, hence why I said, with asterisks...twice...'not always'. However, you are proving my point. You think your needs are somehow special. They aren't. Every contract has a breakdown of 2-5 tasks that tells you how they want you to spend your time. X % teaching, X % research...etc. What do you do that is so special? Teach classes, do research, advise, and serve on committees. It is all the same shit everywhere, people with little power just like to feel like they are special, and because the market is flooded with PhDs, they get validation of their feelings as they can make each applicant spends hours of their life writing an essay, confirming their ego that they are indeed special. Search your feelings, you know it to be true. x3  7)  With nary an example supplied by #4. 8) #4 you already sound like burned out senior faculty-- retire already! 4) Nobody knows what you mean 7, use your words. 9) hm, SC are often required to ask questions from a ruberic in order to avoid implicit bias. They ask every candidate those questions. Doesn't matter if they've read your statements etc.  They gotta ask every candidate that question. ","interview protocol One of the many online guides to the interview process says something like ""never get into a car with a committee member after the dinner under any circumstances, walk back to your hotel no matter how far it is."" What is that all about? 2) Haha, try that interviewing at Minnesota or McGill in January.  Seriously though, I'd ignore that advice anywhere, anytime. 3) Haha What? This sounds like Pence advise. Like don't dine with a woman who isn't your wife, or drive with a committe member after dark. x2 4) What? I've been in all sorts of cars with department and committee members. In one instance, my taxi driver ghosted. I guess I was supposed to walk by the side of the road for 40 minutes in the countryside in heels. 5) Is this working with the assuption that you had like 4 glasses of wine with dinner? Because then maybe you should consider not driving back with them. Otherwise.....6) If a member of the SC is drunk and harasses a candidate, that is probably not a healthy place to work. 7) Same as above. Driven to and from dinner by hosts at every interview x5 8) When dinner is over and everyone is getting ready to leave, I always just say that I'm going to go tie one on at the bar before heading back to the hotel. Problem solved. 9) lol I'll have to try that 8. thanks for the advice. 10) Yeah, whoever wrote that did not envision their advice would have me walk 12 miles in near-0 temperatures at night in the middle of the road (snowbanks = no more road shoulder). There aren't many things less safe than drunk drivers, but that's one of them. (My ride was plenty sober, btw), 10) I personally like the list that advises you to ask if you will have access to the typing pool. 11) LOL 12) It is a weird suggestion. Would never want to be colleague with a person who insists not to take the same car with us. 13) OP here, OK, I thought this was strange, thanks everyone. 14) Yes, SUPER WEIRD ADVICE. just got into like 3 cars with different folks because they took me to dinner. why wouldn't I? we're adults. if we can't be in the same car, I don't know how we can be colleagues. also I'm female and didn't even consider not getting in the car. 15) Plus, crashing might get me that pity offer. 16) I always get in the car but I have been uncomfortable about it (I'm female). One time a search comm member literally handed me money for the airline lounge (I had a super weird flight time) and patted/rubbed my leg in a creepy paternal way while jocularly giving me negotiation advice. SO WEIRD but I took the money because at that point I was just trying to GTHO.  I wound up turning down that job, go figure. ","This is my first year broadly applying and I've been shocked by the frequency with which my gender has come up during campus interviews. Maybe I was naive, but I'd always thought of academia as the field where I felt the most free from any kind of gender stereotyping or sexism, which I'd experienced in droves in other non-academic jobs. But now on the job market, it's coming up in a way I never felt it did as a graduate student or postdoc (with one notable exception, when a male professor told me as an undergraduate about a female job candidate who wasn't hired because she was too attractive and would be a 'distraction' - then remarked that she had looked like me). Even 'positive' statements about how, as a woman, I must be more collaborative or collegial or nurturing of students, I find frustrating because I feel it is just another way of saying that I'm probably not as ambitious or cut-throat or strategic as my male colleagues. But it's not at all clear to me how to respond to these types of statements, especially in a campus interview setting where I'm trying very hard to get an offer! Do other women encounter this frequently? If so, what do you do/say? 2) Holy crap, I've never encountered that kind of thing at interviews. I would say (internally) ""well this place is a big NOPE."" 3) Yep, never encountered that in a campus interview. I agree with 3, RUN! 4) This is especially shitty given the power dynamic (you, interviewing, they, the holder of job offer). Agree with others that this sort of behavior is a red flag. So sorry you've experienced this.  5) I agree that these comments range from unfortunate to WTF, but don't judge a whole institution by a few crazies.  If you give the place a ""big NOPE"" or ""RUN"", you've let those people make your decision for you.  Don't let them control you.    6) I never got it until faculty interviews, but suddenly it was everywhere.  Surprisingly, the old white men seemed to care more about science, less about anything else.  It came just as much from younger faculty. 7) OP here, thank you for the responses and encouragement. This is why we all need to get jobs, so we can NOT say these things to the next generation of women scientists.   8) Yes keep at it! Always remembering that attitudes like that are F'D up; they can be insidious and threaten to wear you down, don't give in. A sort of meta-comment about the ""more collegial"" assumption - it's super frustrating how being more collegial or more collaborative is often judged as a flaw, as if those traits are in opposition to ambition - they are not. People who judge others that way are the ego-driven myopic types (often male) who only know how to measure success with one stick! 9) You argue that people make wrong assumptions about women, then, in the next sentence make sweeping assumptions about men. How can you not see your own sexism? 10) hello, troll. So it's sexist to point out sexism? We are really in a pickle aren't we. 11) Nope, making sexist remarks is. 12) No, that's an observation of sexist behavior. The behavior is sexist, the observation is not. It's an example of treatment that women do encounter on a regular basis. Your experience may differ, for many possible reasons, but if you refuse to consider the reality of somebody else's experience, then you are part of an insidious problem. 13) So you are allowed to disregard the the ""often myopic male"" experiences you speak of, but no one is allowed to disregard your experience? Mixing in some nacissism with that sexism ayy? Very reminiscent of America's President.","Time to give up 1) Is it reasonable to stop trying after two years looking for a job? 2) I feel you OP, and this is my first year on the market! It's been a pretty disheartening experience 3) Jeremy Fox from Dynamic Ecology here. Sorry to hear about anyone's struggles on the faculty job market; it's tough out there for everyone. For context, recently-hired TT N. American ecology asst. profs. are commonly anything from 2-5 years post PhD, with 3-4 being most common: https://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2018/01/04/when-did-newly-hired-n-american-tt-ecology-faculty-get-their-phds/. <1 and >6 are rarer but far from unheard of. But obviously that broader context can't tell any individual what to do. You should do whatever's right for you. Some possibly-helpful discussion here: https://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2015/09/28/ask-us-anything-when-to-give-up-on-a-research-project-and-an-academic-career/. Good luck.4) Thanks very much for the data and insight, # 2 and Jeremy. I really enjoyed that post on when to give up.  5) All of my friends who kept trying found a position they were happy with that set them up for success, if they were flexible and applied broadly.  Some of us had a harder time than others.  It took me 4 years to make it.  Keep publishing and keep applying as long as you want. 6) I know this is how it goes.. just keep trying, hang on tight... the thing is that this is not realistic for everyone. People in long distance relationships, people with financial burden, people who need to contribute financially to family (i.e. parents), people with children... this is why academia struggles to achieve equity, because this very principle of hanging on tight selects for, in most cases, the privileged x5 7) As someone in the hang on tight camp, I still agree 100% it selects for the privileged. Well into 30s and have broken up with multiple partners because they wouldn't follow me. I am ok with that choice but it shouldn't have had to happen. 8) I am with you. But it's always hard to imagine what the improved system would look like. Unis only considering local candidates? Hard to imagine that happening. 9) I'm not really sure what the solution is, I don't think hiring local candidates is the solution, but expecting someone to be a postdoc for several years considering how bad the payment is and how many hours you spend working is not sustainable on the long term. I wouldn't mind being a postdoc for longer if they would pay me more, that way I could visit my partner more often and I wouldn't resent working as many hours as I do. They could give us some benefits, vacation time, I mean, things that are reasonable and do-able.. the fact that we don't have any of this, and that the benefits that we get are pathetic, really makes everyone bitter. Even those that leave academia, usually leave very bitter because they feel they wasted their time and money. This is not the solution itself but would definitely improve the ""leaking pipe"" issue in academia  10) I feel like the standard postdoc position should be offered/advertised/funded for 3-5 years, instead of 1-2 (and pay better). 11) I was lucky to have a postdoc with quite decent pay, lots of vacation time and a very reasaonable workload (basically, as much as I wanted to work). I suspect there's a lot of variation in working conditions. I was at a UC and I do think they are some of the highest-paying university postdocs in the US (though I know some agency postdocs pay even more). 12)@10 I'm in the same situatio. Year 3 of up to 5 yrs of funding. 1 or even 2 yr postdoc is too unstable when there are other members of the family depending on salary and stability. 13) @1 It is reasonable to stop trying whenever you feel the desire to stop. You don't owe it to anyone to continue to struggle. Whether you choose to continue trying for an academic job or to try a different path - good luck! 14) The leaky pipe analogy assumes that there are enough jobs at the end of the pipe to accomodate all those that enter. It may be appropriate for industry (I don't have knowledge here), but I would argue academia is more of a pyramidal structure...you know, like a ponzi scheme. 15) Ponzi scheme for sure shrouded in a veneer of diversity and inclusion","If you're feeling that postdoc career anxiety, hopefully my experience and advice in building resilience might offer some salve  https://medium.com/p/the-resilient-postdoc-how-to-be-ok-with-uncertainty-cb9660ace549?source=email-c07380a76b1e--writer.postDistributed&sk=c07eebe0847d7ac28a8b9554a98ac88c 2) wasn't r/K selection refuted in the 80's? 3) firts major criticism I know of was in the 70's https://www.jstor.org/stable/2459610?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents 4) Yeah, I feel really adventurous not knowing if I should restock food because I don't know when I'll be moving.","Ranking of top applicants How common is it in other countries that a final ranking is send to the top applicants (i.e. who got invited for interviews) when a decision was taken? Where I am from this is usually what happens and many people add that information to their CV if they were ranked second or third. Just got a rejection letter, where they only provide the name of who got hired, so wanna know if its appropiate to ask for more information on the ranking. 1) It is obviously dependent on the country, in some (e.g. Scandinavia) it's customary, in others it's not a thing (e.g. US). So I would say that if they don't offer that information it would be weird for you to ask for it. I would also say that in some places there may not even be a ranking of candidates, people just select the top candidate, they don't bother about ranking the others.  2) Basically unheard of in the US. You might get that info secondhand if you have an insider, but I would never ask. x3 3) Thanks :)"
"no contact Anyone ever not hear back from a SC after an interview? 1) I waited 7 weeks after an interview.  I wrote two emails while waiting, and then the only response I ever got back was from the administrative assistant sending me a rejection letter on the behalf of the SC!  (2) Stephen F. Austin's Biology and Forestry departments after on campus interviews.  Completely rude.  3) I'm in the same boat.  I emailed them about the status of the position 5 wks post-interview and no response.  I'm fine it they are not interest in me anymore but I would like to move on with my life. 
4) Looks like this is pretty common. I'm in the same boat. This probably won't help but, I'm writing a letter to the president and provost of the school informing them, in so many words, that it was pretty shabby/ unprofessional of the department chair and sc to not officially reject or even reply to emails by interviewees. I can see how easy it is to not bother to reject or even respond to emails when you've never met or seen an applicant. But, you've got to be a real dickhead to not send a ""...thanks for interviewing, you suck..."" type email/letter or even respond to emails from someone you met face to face, interacted with for a couple of days, had dinner/breakfast/lunch with, etc. I guess I can just sit back and say fuck it. But, I'd rather let them know. If they can't take the time to officially reject me, then I'm going to officially reject them. (5) Happens all the time.  Can take a while, but eventually you will hear something. (6) Why on earht woudl you think it is a good idea to write a letter to the president et al. This is a small world, and the last thing YOU need to do is come across like a whiner. This is just how it works, AND for any search conducted this year, the POSSIBILITY exists that it is not yet finalized...(7) 6 is right.  It's a REALLY small world.  If you're smart, you'll swallow your pride and while you're at it swallow that letter too.  Rude people suck, but think how much worse you'll feel if they screw you a second time down the road because they remembered your bitchy but ultimately useless letter futilely trying to get them in trouble. (8) I don't really see the point in ""telling on them"", it would accomplish nothing and essentially confirm their suspicions about you. 9) Yup, OP, it happened to me twice last year and possibly once this year. I say possibly because it's been over  3 months since I heard (on here) that the position was accepted and finalized. To #4, if you know that the position is finalized and don't mind burning that bridge then I say go for it and send your letter. Send it directly to the SC too. You're right though, it's not going to help and probably nothing will come of it. But, hey, if it makes you feel better, go for it. If you get a response, I'd love to see it on here.","UGA ecologist Anybody know anything about the UGA ecosystem ecologist position? It's a late announcement for an R1, with only 4 weeks notice. They've also had a lot of turnover lately. 1) UGA is a good place, plenty of different departments with ecologists and evolutionary biologists. 2) As an alum of the program, I've seen that The Institute of Ecology --> Odum School of Ecology transition has not been perfect and the department has been having some growing pains.  They are still attracting top students.  Good faculty who want to stay there could really help make things better. 3) I'll second #1.  A good deal of the turnover has been to some of the very best schools (U Michigan and Yale) - I wouldn't take it as a bad sign.  3) was a grad student there and loved it. yes, the ecology dept has had some issues with turnover b/c of major structural changes - but there are so many people to collaborate with in forestry, genetics, plant bio, agriculture, etc.  i know some of the people who left just wanted to be elsewhere geographically",NA,NA,NA,"This discussion was listed under the ""references contacted"" column of Michigan's ecologist/evolutionary biologist job posting: references contacted (Oct 29)...perhaps all are being contacted?

(OP) I got an email after my last letter was submitted saying my applicaiton was complete too.  I think they're requesting them from all candidates. 2) They requested Letters from my references.

(5) yeah, I still don´t understand the obsession with the letters of recommendation, it is so unscientific to give so much importance to the opinion of 2 or 3 guys. In my opinion, they should ask for letters only if they have some final candidates and they need extra information to make a final decission.  6) in a good school, the 2-3 people are the best of the department, those closely related to the candidate's field, or a combination of both.

(1) Is there a way we could add a section where we can evaluate interviewees or departments?

I would be worried that the university I'm trashing would figure out who I am, especially when trashing a specific department.

I have more and better publications, more experience, more outreach and have secured external funding. He's gotten 2 interviews and I've gotten none. 2 of our 3 references are the same people and both have said this is surprising because their letter for me was stronger than for him. The difference....I'm a woman. When can I feel selfricheously outraged at sexism? 2) oh, right away. My old officemate got the first job he applied for. The last job I interviewed for went to someone with way fewer pubs, less teaching experience than me because he had 'potential.'  3) Oh how I feel you! To rub salt in the wound, anytime someone (male) finds out I'm on the market, they try to give me a pep talk by saying ""oh you'll be fine! Schools are all trying to hire women right now and you're a woman so you'll get a job in no time"" THANKS /sarcasm x3 4) I'm starting to wonder too.  I've had 6 campus interviews but zero job offers... It seems like one should have worked out. 5) After a friend from grad school had a number of interviews with no jobs, we calculated the odds.  If you assume 25% chance of success at each interview, then the probability of 6 non-offers is 0.75^6=17.8%.  Could be just bad luck!  Only if you have >10 non-offers can you say there is a statistically significant issue (P<0.05).  Eventually he got one BTW. 6) I wouldn't get too self-righteously outraged just yet. I believe that implicit bias exists (I've seen direct evidence!); however, I have also seen quantitatively 'inferior' candidates (that is, candidates with a numerically inferior publication record) be invited for campus interviews many times simply because one or more members of the SC have particular interest in their specific research area (not stated in the job ad, BTW), and this has favored both male & female candidates in the past. Consequently, I would avoid the presumption that you are being overlooked in any particular case because of your gender - although it can certainly happen! For our part, we nearly always invite female candidates to interview at a rate that is higher than their representation in the applicant pool. It's impossible to know what role implicit bias has played in decision making beyond the interview stage - although a conscious effort is always made to take it into account.  7) OP here- Fine, fine, I'll just feel unjustifiably selfricheously outraged, then. 8) They failed a search last year that I interviewed for, and I wonder if I didn't get the offer because I seemed, as one faculty member put it, ""so young you're practically an undergrad!"" Would they have said that if I was a 28-year-old man? Implicit bias definitely exists, a young male scientist has ""potential"" but a young female scientist is ""too inexperienced."" 9) 8- that's really, really awful. 10) #6 here. #8, yes I too have seen that in an interview, although that particular candidate was rated highly in the search and the position was ultimately offered to a woman (just not that one). Being interviewed for a 'failed' search is very disheartening. Take solace in the fact that sometimes this is because the faculty are gridlocked, or because the administration decides to reject the recommendation of the faculty (for reasons that may be totally unrelated to the professional qualifications of the proposed candidate). 11) I keep learning that men I went to grad school with whose publications records are not as good as mine have landed TT jobs at research schools, while I still have not had an interview offer. This includes a guy who sexually harassed female undergrads when he was a TA. OP, I'm with you on the self-righteous outrage at sexism. 12) i feel like I have something to offer here--I am a women and my husband and I are both interviewing for jobs.  I have found the interview process to be both biased in my favor and against me. I think it may help to get me to the interview but once I am there then i see how the whole situation is easier on men (surrounded by all male faculty, the whole children thing, i look young and inexperienced etc). However, I think that i have seen time and again both my husband and I loosing out to males and females with less pubs and experience.  i think alot goes into these decisions and alot seems unfair. I wish it all came to a comparison on paper with your CV:( x2","If planning a career in industry, do it as soon as you can A recent paper shows how postdoctoral experience is not benefitial, in terms of compensation, in industry jobs.

Maybe I should modulate down to community colleges. 5) OP here, to be clear I have had parallel plans for R1-2-3-SLAC the whole time, and have snagged some interviews with R2 and down. Maybe I am just learning where I am more welcome. 6) OP again -> I applied to the job o_0 keep plugging away #3, you'll get some nibbles eventually 7) 3 here - thanks very much! Good luck to you! 8) If you want to research, community colleges aren't for you. If you want to teach, CCs are the shit (except for relatively low pay). Speaking from personal experience. ","Received an offer, but interviewing at several other places I have heard conflicting reports about notifying other departments (where you have been scheduled to interivew) about receiving other offers. I still want to interview at these other places and know that offers and negotiations can take some time, so I should be able to interview without formally accepting something from the other university. I just don't know what to do because one interview isn't for another two months and it is at a univeristy that is my top choice. Do I contact them to see if they can move the interview up? Or what?  2) As long as you have not yet accepted an offer, I don't think there is any problem of interviewing other places. It's your decision on whether to notify the departments your offers or not. No need to lie, of course.   Moving up the interview is not going to help because the SC won't be likely to give you an offer before finishing the interview. 3) I think if you really want to be at Z but have offer from Y, you need to tell Z. I recently went through this and Z moved up their interview dates because I told them that I had an on-campus interview elsewhere. 4) During a search, there is a lot of behind-the-scenes talking about the candidates. Whether they have a job offer elsewhere is among the more widely discussed topics.  Having another offer tends to make you more attractive as a candidate.... unless it's clear that we're wasting our time interviewing you since you'd rather go elsewhere and we're just counter-offer bait.  5) This happened to me, but all of my interviews were close together. I had an offer from School A and told School B during my interview and asked them for a timeline for their decision-- we were able to match up their decision with when I needed to give School A a decision.  In your case, you need to tell Z.  I doubt Y will be able to wait months (usually they need a decision in a matter of weeks once an offer is made).

AP",Guys I feel like it's hunting season...and I have a paintball gun.,"Salary differences So I just looked at the negotiations tab - there's clear regional and public vs. private differences but has anyone looked at gender based differences?  Looks like the men all decline the low salaries and the women all ""enthusiastically"" accept them.  Guess I'm just grumpy sitting here at my LAC looking at all the salaries that are so much higher than I make after 9 years post-PhD. 2) [tl;dr 1) Salaries are bad, 2) there is a gender gap caused by multiple factors 3) don't drawn conclusions from wiki data.] Salaries aren't good in academia. That is not new. A gap between gender earnings also exists, with respect to total compensation. There are many studies exploring that, and plenty of magazine articles (https://www.chronicle.com/article/Gender-Pay-Gap-Persists-Across/239553). The reasons for that gender pay gap are also explored in multiple studies, using multivariate analysis - i.e. not simply looking at total compensation. I caution against drawing any meaningful conclusion from obviously biased data listed on this wiki. Others have used this data in the past and arrived at drastically erroneous conclusions from it. Similar to ecologists trying to apply forensic techniques to exploring data fraud in the thread below, ecologists have attempted to apply social science techniques to data on thie wiki and, rightly, drawn serious criticism. 4) I just glanced over the last ~1.5 years' worth of the negotiations tab and don't walk away with the same impression as OP anyway, so hard to imagine this limited dataset offering any real insights along those lines. I think it's better looked at as a way to get ballpark estimates on offers and to see how negotiations progress (i.e. the offer, what the counteroffer was, timelines, etc), and really not much beyond that. 5) Ah - out of the 114 offers posted, 44 of the 70 that went to women were initially 75k or higher as opposed to 8 out of the 44 reported by males.  Based on this sample - women are not only getting the majority of offers, but are getting great offers. Congrats!"
"new insults Ok, yes the douchebag thing is getting out of hand.  It was a perfectly good swear word and now you've ruined it.  Can we at least come up with some new nasty, insulting things to say?  Honestly, I don't think I'd want to hire any of us at this point, it sounds like a particularly nasty seventh grade locker room.  It was very funny when John Stewart called Tucker Carlson a douchebag but it's been worn out on this wiki.  How about piss-ant?  Bunghole.  I don't know but if I read douchebag one more time I'm going to hurl. Just my 2-cents. Agreed! If we cannot refrain from insulting our colleagues, then I suggest we move away from generic and meaningless insults, and replace them with accurate and descriptive words or phrases. 'Wankers' seems an attractive option. (2) I like the term ""Douche Nozzle"". (3) One of my favorite Brit aphorisms is ""Tosser"" which means the same thing as ""Wanker"" but has a more dignified ring to it.","1 year visiting positions Out of curiosity, what do people think about the 1 year positions?  So, I guess they are a step up from adjunct positions, but I doubt they give you the time and resources to keep your research going.  In today's competitive job market, which is better for an RII type setting? (1) I did a VAP right after I got out of grad school, because I couldn't land a postdoc right away. Maybe it's because it was my first time to teach a whole lecture course on my own (and the fact that the class I had to teach was completely out of my expertise), but it didn't leave me any time to do research whatsoever. I got out of it as soon as I could find a suitable postdoc. However, I did hear about another VAP before me in the dept managed to do some collaborative work with a tenured professor there. I'm not sure if it was published, though. (2) I think 1 is right - as a VAP you would have a hard time applying for 50 TT positions while trying to maintain some sort of a social life in your spare time...(3) I don't want to seem cavalier, but it shouldn't take more than 30 minutes to tailor an application and send it out. They all want the same pile of paper (i.e. Cover letter, CV, Teach. Philo., Research Int., Transcripts, Letters). Customizing an app. should be a skill you have aleady acquired and not be that ugly, regardless of your teaching load (4) I'm not trying to be a jerk either, but I agree with 3. Other grad students and faculty told me not to apply to certain places because it ""took too much time and effort"" for a position I probably wouldn't get. Seriously, it takes maybe half an hour. Once you have a template for a cover letter you're mostly done. I'm sure some wiseasses out there will say my apps must have been pretty generic and not very good if I only spent a half an hour, but I personalized that template for each school, got six phone interviews, two campus interviews, and a job. Half an hour well spent. Well, half an hour times a bunch of apps ;) Sorry this is off the main topic, but when I saw 3's comment, I had to let this out. I couldn't believe how many people told me applying was such a time sink that it wasn't worth it to even try for most jobs. (5) My advisor recommended against applying for VAPs if I ultimately want to end up at at RU rather than a SLAC. No time for research, and RU don't really care if you have more experience teaching if you have good research experience. Of course, VAPs pay the bills when there aren't post-doc positions available. (6) #1 again, @ #3+4: the OP was asking how a VAP-ship will affect your time budget in terms of doing research, not job search. Applying for the next job is something that you always have to make time for anyway, until you get tenure, that is. (7) I'm a Visiting Assistant Prof at a well-known liberal arts. I make 65K a year (damn good money for the area in which I live) plus full benefits. I was given modest start-up funds, funding to cover travel and other costs associated with conferences, and money to pay for student stipends during the summer. I was also given beautiful office space and a brand new computer. I have a relatively relaxed teaching load. I am able to maintain an active research program and have applied to no less than 2 dozen jobs this season (maybe more). My point? It's doable. I'm busy, but it's very doable. Bottom line is that I am SOOOOO glad I accepted this position. I did one year of formal postdoc before coming here; I'm glad I decided to come here rather than staying where I was. 
(8) #3 here in reply to #1/6, the response from me (and #4) was to the comment made by #2 : ""...as a VAP you would have a hard time applying for 50 TT positions while trying to maintain some sort of a social life in your spare time.""  (9) #1 again @ #7: wow, a salary comparable to new TT profs AND startup funds? No wonder you are happy there. The VAP-ship I had was nothing near that, only 47K pay, no start-up, and I had to share office with 2 other VAP's. I basically felt like a glorified TA. And mine was actually at a R1 school in a pretty expensive city, too. So you can see why I wanted to get out ASAP. (10) #7 here @ #1:  yes, I feel EXTREMELY lucky indeed.  They do not really differentiate (at least in terms of salary) between visitors and new TT faculty here.  My ""startup"" was not big (<$10,000), but I'm only here for < 2 years and my research costs are extremely low.  The downside is that even with TT jobs I've pretty-much got nowhere to go but down from here (in terms of salary, benefits, office space, etc).  I just interviewed for a TT job where my salary would be 77% what it is now!  Woe is me.  :-)",NA,NA,NA,"I am in an authorship dispute with one of my references which has now turned quite nasty.  I foresaw this relationship going south and stopped using this person as a reference a while ago, but I still have their name out there on an open application that I care about.  Initial Letters of reference went in already before things went really bad between us, but there is always the chance that further follow up will happen with references if I keep progressing. Should I contact the selection committee at all, or wait and see if I get invited to interview further and bring it up then somehow? 1) Unfortunately, I think you have nothing to do about that one application at this point.  Assuming the initial letter was fine, bringing this up would be a red flag.  Assuming the initial letter was poor, you're probably out of the running and won't be able to change that with a phone call or email.  Hopefully the initial letter was fine and you make the cut, and if so, I also think it's unlikely that the SC would follow up with your references additionally.  Usually, once you make the cut your application goes out the window and you're judged on your interview from that point forward. 2) This is anecdotal but I have never heard of letter-writers being contacted again. Definitely do not contact the SC about this. 3) OP here.  Thanks for the input.  For the sake of info of others, I made it through to a campus interview earlier this year, and they rang and had long conversations with each of my references before flying me out. So in my experience, there is indeed a chance your references will get contacted.  Perhaps though that was a more anomalous situation that I'd realized. 4) In my experience references do get contacted a second time. I have had 3 total on-campus interviews. The first, I did not get an offer and my refs were not contacted. The second, I didn't get an offer but refs were contacted prior to the campus interview. I finished my third on-campus interview (first this year) and I am in the running. The search chair is meeting with my references (today!) ","Maybe I'll go for that potato job after all... 2) LOL!!! That potato job has saved my sanity, I think.3) Do you  realize how fucking important potatoes are to the caloric intake of the world? We need potato specialist!","Length of application materials I now have my first. Tell me things that worked, things that didn't, absolute DOs and DON'Ts. 2) Relax, act like a colleague, ask them a lot questions about their teaching/research (depending on focus of the school), remember that you are also interviewing them, be enthusiastic and read resources on Spencer Hall's site (among many others) - there is a lot of resources out there. 3) Yep what 2 said. Make sure you know how you are going to hit the ground running (whether that is teaching or research or both - have clear ideas about classes you would want to teach/develop and what is your first grant for instance). Don't mention sig. other. Some committees try to fish this out of you - basically, they shouldn't be but they do try. Work hard on your job talk because that can really count for a lot. You can lose a job based on a bad job talk... And good luck to you! 4) Definitely do background search on the search committee members. Find out where they went to school, what their interests are, etc.  Drop a couple lines when speakign with them about those things like ""Hey I see you went to College U. Go Spartans!"". Also make sure to send thank you emails to everyone you met with and in them, drop a line so they rememebr you like, ""it would be grea tto collaborate on that project we talked about..."" 5) I used to do that thank you e-mail idea and was told by several folks that the faculty were annoyed by it.  Mixed advice. 6) #5, I totally disagree. The follow-up email is crucial. You have to display to the search committee that you remain interested in the position.  7) There was a previous thread on this topic already, see ""Advice for campus interview at research school"" below, and GOOD LUCK!! 8) #2 again. Yes you should email a thank you to everyone you met with one on one. Most won't be annoyed by this. Don't make it sound that you have the job or try to start up collaborations at that point. Just a few sentences such as...""Thanks for your time. I really enjoyed talking to you about X, Y and Z. It was great to have the opporutnity to meet everyone."" 9) most people who I know that got jobs emailed the search committee members specifically. when you meet with deans and provosts and all of that, it can be a bit much. but following up is always a good idea.

I'm a postdoc now and not doing any teaching, but was wondering if it would be appropriate to provide selections of the (anonymous) evals that students provided after the semester. I've had a number of students indicate what a good teacher I am, and that I made them want to be present and participate in a course that otherwise is very difficult (and their evals of me are not related to their grades to be sure). But would SCs think it tacky? 2) I'd be careful. TAing is a VERY different beast from actually teaching a course. 3) Before I taught my own class and I was a TA I just included one or two quotes from my students. I'm in a research-only postdoc, but I taught a summer course.  It was a tough 10 weeks (with 100% research + 25% teaching), but greatly improved my teaching statement.  4) I have been to Jobs Seminars where they said numbers and select comments on evals are recommended if you are applying for teaching professorships (not research professorships).  The catch is that you don't want it to sound like you cherry picked comments.  They said including constructive criticism and how you responded the next year may create a more comprehensive portion of your teaching.  I've never heard positive eval comments viewed as a bad thing, so long as they are representative.  ",Bullshit artistry. ,"this site Big thanks for getting this up quickly and in a good format! [x7] 2) No prob! Want to help out? Post jobs when you see them & keep the updates flowing. 3) Yes, thanks so much for your work in producing this. I wanted to suggest, however, that the discussion be moved next year to the Fandom Academic Jobs Wiki, like other jobs in the Humanities and Social Sciences. Seems like a lot less work and provides email updates -- plus, it's convenient for people like me who are working in between the natural and social sciences! But thanks again to the volunteers who make this possible. 4) We've tried wikis in the past. Seems like ecologists prefer spreadsheets over text. #twocultures? 5) Yes, thanks for making this spreadsheet happen (I like spreadsheets that can be sorted :) ). Is it possible to get the searches that have accepted offers moved to a new tab? I feel like that might have been done in the past (or prehaps misremembering). 5) I'd rather keep all the positions on one page. (x3)","Should I be surprised that all video interviewers are from the same gender? That sends a negative message to me..... 2) Not surprised. All the places I've interacted with had at least one woman on the panel. 3) It doesn't happen often. If it happens that none of the female faculty can attend certain event, then just accept it, and hope that there will be more female faculty in that department in the future. On a relavant note, there are on average less than 20% female faculty. If we expect that female faculty always representated in administrave activities, this will have negative impact to those female professors. 3) Panels sometimes include support staff, teaching faculty, etc. I'm not buiying the idea that they couldn't find any women to involve in the process.  4) In 5 years of job hunting, I've never once seen a phone interview include support staff. 5) I have. They were presumably making an effort to have multiple women present. 6) #3 again, I am not talking about a scenario that no female faculty involves in faculty search, but saying that no female faculty in one candidate's video interview, and I don't think the OP need to interpret it in a particularly negative way.  7) the OP could mean that all the video interviewers are female, but everyone assumed that they are all male. 8) We're Bayesians like that. Number of times I've seen a search committee with more women than men == 0. Ideally, there should be an even split, however. 8) OP here. I tried to be neutral in my original question, but the sad fact is all the interviewers are male. I know there are many possible reasons why female SC could not attend the video interview. I was just really surprised as this is the first time I ever experienced this. For my past video interviews, there were always > 30% female faculties. 9) So that does suck, and I understand how you feel. I am the only one of my gender in my huge lab and I will be honest, it is weird and there is an inescapable gender bias in us all. To the larger point, PhDs are awarded mostly to men in ecology, and on average, women are actually overrepresented as faculty in ecology departments based on the number of ecology PhDs (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ecs2.2031/full). As always, the best person should get the job, and interviewing with a bunch of people with the opposite gender (id) is hard, even though it shouldnt be, it also shouldn’t be very surprising (or encouraging given everything we know about gender bias [good refs in that article]). Good luck! 10) #9, your remark that PhDs in ecology are awarded ""mostly to men"" is well out of date. As of 2013, women comprised 52% of post-2000 US PhD recipients in ecology according to the data in the Hampton & Labou 2017 Ecosphere paper you linked to. 9) I don’t recall ’my remark’ having a date. From the paper: ‘The gender breakdown for all ecology Ph.D. graduates since 1968 was 37.2% female and 62.8% male.’ That means, more men have been awarded ecology PhDs than women. Also, you didnt get the info you cite completely correct: the stat your are trying to quote actually is using data from 2000 onward, not ‘as of 2013.’ Barba non facit philosophum. 11) I don't need to quote Latin to demonstrate that the proportion of men receiving PhDs in 1969 is utterly irrelevant to whether women are disproporionately hired as assistant professors in 2018. To cite the proportion of men receiving PhDs in 1969 as evidence that women are overrepresented is the single worst argument I've seen on this wiki yet, and that's saying something. 9) Well, you may wish to rebut the authors in the journal, because they did the analysis, not me. Also, it isnt an argument, but a statement of fact with no judgement one way or another. You assigned your own judgement to it because you are angry, and that is part of the reason civil discussion of science is rare in America. And again, had you actualy read what I wrote (or the actual paper), you would know that it is not the number of PhDs granted in 1969, but SINCE 1968 (the mathematical function called cumulative). Your anger has clouded your comprehesion of facts. I will leave a quote from John Adams so you don’t have to ‘quote latin’: ‘Facts are stubborn things; and whatever may be our wishes, our inclinations, or the dictates of our passions, they cannot alter the state of facts and evidence.’ It is not clear to me whether people are trolling this page or just so willfully ignorant. In either case I won’t respond again, so feel free to misrepresent what I wrote all you like. 10) <- you're hilarious (I'm not angry, I'm genuinely laughing). You think noting that it is cumulative makes including numbers from a half century ago relevant to today's job market.  12) Perhaps not relevant to the job market in terms of the pool of applicants, but probably relevant in terms of the decisions being made by search committees/departments. FWIW, I'm on a SC now, for a job on this wiki, and fewer than 25% of the applicants were female. 13) So 10 my Ph.D. advisor got his degree in 1957, and he is still on searches. 14) Plus the whole cumulative thing.... 10) I understand there's a discrimination hangover that makes it more likely that older faculty skew toward men. To say that women are overrepresented in ecology is disingenous, my only point. Would anyone argue they are overrepresented in non-TT appointments and underrepresented in positions of power and tenure? If 50% of new hires in the past five years were women, but women were less than 50% over the past 50 years, that would not make them overrepresented. Guys get extremely defensive about this issue the second there's a perception things might favor women. And for women on the job market, seeing a panel of all old guys can send a message that has real effects.  15) Are you a guy? Because you seem to be the one getting defensive. Saying something is overrepresented isnt saying it is right. You could take a grab sample of a lake and only get  Wolffia. That sample is overrepresentive of Wolffia in  the entire lake. I agree with 9 that it just a statement of facts, and you are the person making it into an argument. 16) I still think you should read the paper, because what overrepresented means is in terms of the number of phds granted, not the number of new hires or whatever you are thinking. Also, I think it was said that the best person should get the job? Can we not discuss simple numbers? 17) I’m sorry, “Guys get extremely defensive about this issue”? Wow. Stereotype much? Unbelievable. 18) My anecdata are consistent with bros getting defensive. Have you any idea how often women are told things will be easy for them due to political correctness, and how often male faculty will think the makeup of the department is fine when several fields have no women? 19) Are you arguing that anecdotal experiences are an excuse to stereotype by gender?  20) Ha, have you ever been on Twitter? #yesallmen There's also literature consistent with people not believing bias doesn't exist when it doesn't affect them. 19) https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whataboutism  21) Someone characterizing men as ""bros"" on a professional forum.  We've found the sexist. 22) No, dear. Some men. Mostly white cishet ones.  23) Love that sexist condescension, #22. Glad to see that you're spicing it up with racist and gender/sexuality-based derision too. /s 24) Racism against white people isn't a thing. 25) Hey 17, way to shoot yourself in the foot there. x2","Job talks Are there any good resources for putting together and delivering a job talk that others have found useful? 2) don't know of any repositories, but imho I'm simply not dazzled by discussion of how collaborative a candidate is (i.e., don't explicitly talk about how collaborative you are, demonstrate it by describing collaborative projects on which you've played a pivotal role), or grandiose descriptions of things that could be. It should undoubtedly be the best talk you can give, but a good job talk often differs from the normal departmental seminar that we take on the road. I think the latter should be a nice story that's covered in sufficient depth, but a job talk should wow your future colleagues with what all is possible if they should happen to choose you (based on your demostrable accomplishments and not any ad nauseam info about all these great ideas/pipe dreams). Good luck!!! 3) I always take the promises of intra-departmental collaboration with a grain of salt...","I'm quite grateful that one of the search chairs replied to my email asking what I could have done to make my application more competitive.  But the response is a little alarming.  This was for an R2 institution, and I was told that the faculty are expected to produce 2-3 papers per year, and that they want to see the same level of publication from postdocs, and I didn't have enough publications as a postdoc to be competitive.  I've been a postdoc for a little under 3 years, and in that time I have 3 published journal articles, 5 published peer-reviewed conference papers (at a comp sci/bio hybrid conference with about a 30-40% acceptance rate; people write 8 page papers for the conference, which are peer-reviewed to determine who is accepted and published), and 2 more submitted journal articles on pre-print servers, all post-PhD (3 other journal articles during my PhD, all 1st author, including one in Science).  If that's too low of research productivity for an R2....I'm screwed.  2) That's nuts. You seem to have been plenty productive so just keep on keeping on. Something will pan out. 3) You sound very productive. If this was an Interdisciplinary position, the committee may not have understood that conference abstracts are real publications in your field.  4) If you are applying for Biology jobs they may have discounted the conference papers, explaining why they view productivity as low.  Ask a colleague who is also interdisciplinary how to highlight that in your CV.  Add an explanation in your cover letter and ask your PI to add an explanation in their rec letter.  Emphasize that these are peer reviewed and comparable to publications for your field. Most biologists DO NOT know about that cultural difference.  A school with less research emphasis and less emphasis on research across other depts will be less likely to know these.  Keep applying and don't discount R1 jobs for the rest of this season or the next.  If you see jobs cross listed with CS or applied Math, make sure you apply.   Best of luck, and I hope you find a committee that is savvy enough to know the difference.  5) 1 again -- most of the jobs I've applied for have been bio jobs, though a few have been in math or CS.  I've been hesitant to stick the conference papers and the journal articles into a combined list without distinguishing between them, since the conference papers are generally about 1/3 to maybe 1/2 of a full journal paper in terms of content (depending on journal) and I don't want to pretend they're fully equivalent, but the idea to address this in a cover letter seems plausible.  I'll check with the CS prof who is a reference for me. 6) The SC is misguided. I've had a number of on-site interviews at R1s with fewer pubs per year than your SC expects. Tell 'em to eat it.  7) Expecting a postdoc to be as productive as a prof (who has a lab filled with students writing papers and putting the prof's name on them) is asinine.  SC chair is a plonker. x3 8) The professsor is also teaching, mentoring grad and undergrad students, serving on committees, and those students in their lab aren't producing papers during the first few years unless the PI is lucky enough to have a post-doc in their lab. A post-doc should outproduce a new prof. 9) Not all postdocs are created equal though. I'm a postdoc treated as someone who should outproduce the PI but I'm also running the PI's lab and teaching a large class. I know everyone has a different experience, but it's frustrating that we're expected by R2s and PUIs to produce as much as a research-only postdoc and/or PI while also doing the job of lab manager and instructor.  8.5) I realize not everyone liked my comment, but deleting someone who disagrees with you is a petty move.  PIs should have the same productivity as postdocs at a minimum.  10) FWIW, I do teach a class.  And serve on a departmental committee.  And do ~15 hours / week admin work to keep an education study running, which seems analgous to the lab manager work that a number of others do.  As a postdoc.  I know that there are postdocs who don't have those commitments, but it's just not universally true that postdocs have little-to-nothing to do professionally other than writing papers and data generation/analysis. 11) On the flipside, I've been told that I have too many publications to be competitive at some R2s/Masters (including by members of search committees) despite the fact that I really would be happy with some of those jobs. We can't win.   4) @11 If you want an R2 job, you really have to sell yourself on how you would fit with the research environment.  Pushing UG research and emphasizing the importance of good teaching in your cover letter may help.  ""I am committed to training the scientists of the future"".   5) @4 Not all R2s have an undergrad focus. I just got hired at an R2 with professors of the practice for all core cirriculum, and a 1:2 teaching load for research faculty, with no teaching during the first year. The focus for Assistant Profs is definitely getting grants, and mentoring PhD/Masters/Undergrads - not just undergrad research and teaching like a SLAC.","Campus visit but with no travel funds I have been invited to an on-campus visit but was then told the university has almost no money to bring me on to campus. Through my reading between the lines of our email exchanges I think they are now bringing in more 'local' candidates because it will be cheaper. It is easy to say ""don't bother since the university has no travel money they won't pay well and will be chronically underresourced"" but I am soon to be unemployed and this is a potential job. We are all desperate for a position. I am super frustrated because I spent a lot of time preparing the application, having letters sent in up front, preparing for the phone interview, and doing well enough to warrant an interview. Now I find out I will be penalized or possibly totally thrown out just because I can't get to their campus within their travel budget (the travel budget is so low that only those that live within an hour or two drive of the campus could possibly attend). Anyone have any suggestions? Do I suggest a skype interview while other people get to go to campus (but I would be at a huge disadvantage if this were the case)? Do I press the department to bring me in because I have an email saying they want to bring me in and they should honor that? Do I move on and chalk it up as a loss? 2)Sorry 1. I've had non-TT academic jobs pay for travel, and your situation is unusual.  Did you ask if they could cover a slightly higher than normal portion of the expenses? If not, this is a likely indicator that resources are limited for faculty and salary could be lowball too. Spend the costs to travel there only if you really like the position and location. 3) #1 again, this is in a very good geographic location for me but I am currently in a post-doc living in a quite expensive part of the US and unable to invest the money to travel for an interview for a job I might not get. Besides, the applicants shouldn't ever be expected to cover their travel costs for an interview. It just seems odd that they would even invite people to campus if there are essentially no travel funds. 4) That seems so crazy. But I wonder if you'd have an advantage, if your competitors are being ranked by location more than quality? 5) Ask if you can do it virtually, if not, go bowling. 6)#1 again, my hesitation to do it virtually is that I would likely have to do a ton of prep to do the interview when at a massive disadvantage because I am not there in person while other candidates are 7) So you want to foot the bill for the chance to be in what seems to be a tenuous position for the rest of your career? Look, I've interviewed at some *broke* schools - starting salary offer of 43k - and they still flew me out. You do not need to be in academia so bad that you need THIS job. Financial woes this bad should be a nonstarter. I wouldn't even give them the courtesy of an e-interview if they're not flying people out - think about your future. x2 8) If you have other jobs that still might come through, then invest more in those (with your time, energy, etc.) and leave this one behind. Only take on the cost of paying for your own travel to this job if you think it's the only job you might get. Even then, it might be better to get a non-academic, but well paying job for one year while going on the market again next year. 9) It sounds like they are just not that into you, sorry.  Maybe write them an email that you are interested in this position particularly because of x and you have x to offer them but can't afford to fly out there, is there any additional assistance they can offer? It's worth a shot, I think. 10) As others have said that's a very bad sign. Forget them if you can afford to.  11) That could easily be a chair or dean that is trying to sabotage a search.  Or maybe a search chair with a COI being interviewed for that job so they want you to back out.   Can you use frequent flier miles to fly out and then stay on a faculty member's couch?  If you can, then do it. 12) @11, holy head-in-the-sand, batman! If the school is so broke they can't afford to fly candidates in, you don't want to be there. If the admin-faculty relationship is so toxic they're trying to sabotage searches by withdrawing funds mid-search, you do not want to be there. WHY would you expect this to improve when you arrive? x2 13) Seeing as though it seems you have nothing to lose at this point, you could come right out and ask about the financial situation and how it will impact you if you join the department. Maybe over the phone? 14) @OP, is it the flight cost? get creative with dates and airports. Google flights is a good place to look if youre really that interested in this job. Try nearby airports, budget airlines (Frontier, Spirit, etc.) anbd then rent a car and drive an hour or two. That should drop the cost to the university down to a couple hundred bucks (YMMV however). 14) I would not do what @13 suggests. I think as @14 is suggesting, you can try to use this as an opportunity to show how excited you are by the position by trying to help get the cost down. I agree with your sentiment that a TT job at a poorly funded school is better than no job at all. I feel like if they are seriously considering you, they will try something to get you there. It really is unreasonable to not cover travel costs, and if the situation is really that dire it seems like they could reduce the starting salary of the position or something like that. 15) #1 here again. The university withdrew their offer to bring me on-campus so I guess this is a fruitless discussion. But the take home message for me is that I am not going to pay for my own travel, no matter how desperate I am to get a job. And I guess I need to be more upfront to universities that I currently live in a geographic location that makes it a bit more expensive to bring me in for a visit. Sad that my geographic location will exclude me from certain positions. 16) Really curious to know what school it was though...17) So sorry! That is such a bummer. So are you living outside of the US or Canada? I actually have heard of schools not paying for people to come from abroad, although even then they usually cover the expense of airfare up to say, 600 dollars (i.e., an expensive domestic flight). Again, really sorry about this. 18) #1 again, I live in the US and the flights aren't that unreasonable for an on-campus visit. I have had other on-campus visits where they don't think twice about paying the airfare, hotel, car rental and even per diem. This place won't even cover the airfare. I would love to 'expose' the university but I won't. 19) OK then that is definitely unreasonable. Probably not a good place to be at anyway! 20) Sorry 1 - that totally sucks. FWIW, I don't want to hire a graduate student without meeting them in person first, much less a permanent colleague in my department. This whole situation seems like way too much of a red flag even if you really need a job right now 20) OP dodging bullets like a regular Neo, frankly","Just saw a twitter feed complaining about awkwardly worded personalized cover letters. Advice I’ve read for writing a cover letter now ranges from “personalized, rewritten for every job, mention specific people” to “why would you personalize anything or mention anyone, that is ridiculous!”. Opinions on cover letters seem completely random from position to position. I can read minds, so this isn’t a problem for me, but I empathize with others that lack this skill. 2) I read the same twitter thread and was having very similar thoughts. The academic application process is out of control. 3) If only search committees were in a positon to provide instructions on how to apply in the ad...x3 4) You can personalize a letter without mentioning people by name. At the end of the day ""best fit"" is going to be the place that resonates with the letter you best think represents you. Maybe I'm too optimistic. 5) What? That is so confusing. Best fit happens at the place that resonates with the letter that best represents a person? 6) I also think mentioning names are awkward, unless something is obvious. 7) 1 again. We all know that cover letters are awkward but my larger complaint is that it is tough when you spend time trying to personalize your application for a system that seems to immediately depersonalize the applicants. 8) After just reviewing a ton of cover letters I’d say that what is meant by personalization is in some way conveying how you’re a fit for the job.  So if it’s a teaching focused gig, make sure it’s clear that you love teaching.  If it’s R1 level research, focus on that and say how your research fits into the department/job call.  If they have specific needs that are mentioned in the job ad be sure to talk about how you meet them in the cover letter.  If it’s a SLAC, make sure you are being clear that you are aware of what’s done at a SLAC and can fit it (e.g. don’t talk about massive high-dollar molecular work). It doesn’t need to be over the top, but it has to be clear that you read the ad and are showing how you’ll meet those needs.  The 1/3 of cover letters that had zero personalization I pretty much threw out as it was obvious they didn’t even consider how their skills fit the job.  I still read the rest of the docs, but it put a bad taste in my mouth for sure. Oh, and don’t be afraid to talk personally why you want to work at the place. Do you love the area?  Did you go to a SLAC and have a great experience?  It’s one more thing to show your enthusiasm.  +2 9) #8 has nailed it.  Did you do research at our university's field station? Say so in the cover letter! Does your research have all of the specific adjectives in the job ad? (Why yes, I specialize in the field ecology of potato metabolomics! <-*thumbs up*) Say so in the cover letter! Are there centers on campus that you would be interested to learn more about if you had an interview?  Say so in the cover letter! Do you know anything about our campus's special mission (e.g. in teaching)? Say so in the cover letter! Bottom line is: The cover letter is a letter of recommendation that you write for yourself about why you should be considered for the job. There are some things that your letter writers can address better than you; leave that for your letter writers.  But there are certain things only you can address.  Address them in your cover letter.  Your research & teaching statements (also CV) probably don't change much from job app to job app.  Your cover letter is the part that you personalize for each job, saying how you fit the particular qualities they're looking for in the ad. x2 10) @9 Do you not change your research statement between applications? I'm applying pretty broadly myself (SLAC  to R1), so the level of research I expect to accomplish at each type of institution varies, which is reflected in my research statements. 11) TLDR cover letter is a place to stroke committee ego x2 12) @8&9 I think that is great advice but if I may gently suggest to all search committee members that if you are excluding 30% of applications on some criteria, consider adding a sentance about what you want to the job ad. Remember that there is a person on the other side of each application and that we get many conflicting/confusing suggestions about the job process. 13) Remember there are people on the search committee and in the department and they are never going to completely agree on what is most important to them and what they are seeking in an application. To expect a universal set of intructions spelling out what should be in a cover letter (@3) is unrealistic. Do you really want every position to have it own set of pages and pages of instructions? 14) I think what really needs to change in the whole process is that I should get the job I want, where I want it. If I don't get that, I'm going to be super upset about the entire process. 15) UK job ads actually do have specific instructions about the information you need to provide. Yes it's tedious, but at least you know what they expect. 16) - #8 here @12 I mean, we said you should be able to teach X, Y, and Z and ability to work with a diverse student body.  Those 30% didn’t even mention how they are qualified or experienced in these areas.  We weren’t being cagy with the description… people just straight up didn’t even try.  @11 – No, it’s not us stroking our ego, it’s normally us deciding who we want to work with for potentially the rest of our careers. Faculty jobs differ from PhD/Postdoc life in that you don’t have a huge say in who you work with (in research I would choose my colleagues), but once your faculty your colleagues are decided for you.  Frankly, I want someone who is fully aware of what the job is and is eager to do it. As I said before, the standards are not over the top in that you have to write a new letter from scratch.  But 30 minutes of googling and some small additions/tweaks in every letter can do a ton to make you stand out. X2 17) I agree. If as an applicant I were not willing to do the little bit of research and editing that it takes to personalize each cover letter, then why would I expect to stand out as a candidate for a faculty position in the first place?     18) Asking for someone to be aware that your department has strengths in speciation and tropical canopy ecology is different from wanting an application to reference umbrella programs no outsider could possibly know existed, or hoping to see sucking up to the search chair whose name is not publicly released.  I've seen schools take it too far when reviewing apps, to their detriment in passing over great hires. 19) Who said ""suck up to the chair""? If you are naming who you want to collaborate with you have a better chance of upsetting/turning-off people off than pleasing anyone. You might be naming the person that you would be replacing. I'd recommend talking about the department rather specific people. But that's just one person's opinion; other letter readers might feel different.   18) @19 I have litterally heard a search chair complain that the candidates did not mention how stellar the chair's own research was.  He did not want to interview people who did not list his name in their application.  I also heard a search committee say that because a candidate had not mentioned the surrounding (small) town during their campus visit they did not want to hire the person.   Pure narcissism.  19again) No doubt there are jerks out there. I still think on average you are better off not mentioning specific names in the letter. x2 20) All jobs boil down to a mix of teaching, research, and service. It is pure narcissism and a crowded job market that makes committees want candidates to talk about their pet projects or programs, or how they are soooooooo diverse. Your school and department are not special, you have been deluded into thinking that so you can protect your own little fiefdom of power and pay people ridiculously low wages and no overtime. Everyone applying is qualified to do exactly what you do. You just currently have the luxury and power to demand custom tailored writings and rarely display the courtesy of even sending form letters to candidates who weren't selected. Before coming to a job wiki to complain about candidates, take a look at yourself. Could it be that you are deluded by the power you currently have in hiring? Could it be that professorship applications ask for more materials from candidates that ever? Could it be that your job add is incredibly vague and your expectations are unreasonable? Even if a comittee answered ""NO"" to all of these and is unsatisfied with the candidate pool, coming here to air grievance is a professional disgrace. x2 21)  You alright there #20?  You realize there are jobs outside of academia that you can go do as you clearly think all profs are terrible people.  Also, I don't think anyone here is saying talking about pet projects or sucking up.  Just a very, very basic level of tweaking.  It's crazy to think that's asking too much. Also, it doesn't sound like any people here with search experience are aring grievances.  They're just providing tips. X2 22) Um, see two posts below: a committee member cursing at candidates. x2 18) Part of reading the venting page is sorting the garbage out from the real genuine advice.  Hopefully at least some good info comes through, even when the job app process totally sucks. +1!! 19) The only thing that has changed in job application requirements over the past 15 years is the addition of diversity statements (sorry that we are trying to be ""sooooo diverse"") and maybe a shift towards not asking for letters up front.  23) Well, I've also heard from profs that the number of papers they are seeing from job applicatns is increasing 24) The applications have certainly changed and become tedious. I applied to my position with a 12 page application. Applicants I review now have 50+ page applications with three types of statements to write, long cover letters, transcripts, syllabi, and reprints. I see it as a total waste of time for everyone, we can't read all of these applications thoroughly. That also doesn't include the idiotic computer system that you have to join and navigate to apply. I was fortunate to be applying at a time when I could just mail my applications out. On top of that, people today are applying for up to fifty jobs a year. I applied to six. Yet we are expecting them to read and understand our school from the outside and tailor their applications with some sort of inside knowledge? I feel bad for these bright scholars that endure the needless and endless slog that this has all become. 25) Sure seems to me that the original post on Twitter basically opened up the possibility of legal action - candidates might be chosen on things other than professional accomplishments, such as how they tailor a letter or font use or how they characterize their things on their CV. At leat in my institution, we are required to promote candidates based on their accomplishments, not on how they project themselves on paper or during personal interactions. That's a huge no-no. Admitting that these things are important is basically saying 'I'm an asshole and too stupid to read through your stuff so I look at minutia"" and get frustrated and toss your stuff in the trash pile"". Maybe that's reality but admitting it/taking out your weakness on someone else is another thing entirely. 26) @25 I don't think ""Comic Sans user"" is a protected class. 27) @26 There are dozens of us! Dozens! 28) Don't laugh but tweets (even stupid ones) can have legal ramifications. I see it in the news but also at my current institution when it comes to tenure decisions and even reversals (denials turned into tenure being granted because people tend to act as if tenure means immunity, which it doesn't, it means you can't get fired without cause, etc.). 29) @25 I interpreted that twitter thread not as making any claims that applications weren't getting taken seriously, or were being rejected, based on formating etc, but rather it was a list of suggestions on these things to make the apps easier to read / assess. that's a pretty big difference I would think  30) Usually general advice like tips on how to put your best foot forward is considered appropriate from any reviewer.  Mentioning specific applications is a breach of confidentiality.   You could contest that things like font size are not supposed to be review criteria unless mentioned in the ad.  Usually this does not influence who gets invitations to interview so much as it just makes the committee shake their heads.  31) wasnt aware anyones application was mentioned specifically here ","Official offer wait time  I was unofficially offered an asst profesor possition and spoke on the phone with the chair, they asked me to submit a list for my start up, spoke about salary and so on. They told me we could negotiate more after I get the official offer (i.e. written offer). So this was over a month ago, still don't have the official offer and I'm getting nervous.  I asked for an update and was told they're waiting on the high-level administratives. Is this normal? 2) Took about a month from verbal offer to get my written letter x2  3) IUsually universities are just slow.  It has to get through 2-3 layers of HR/Dean/Provost, etc  If it's only been a few days reply with ""Thanks, I will write to check in again in 2 weeks.""    I did have one school ghost me at negotiation, then the Dean told the dept I wasn't interested.  When I wrote to the chair saying I took another offer, I made sure she knew what had happened.  If that job were my first choice, I would have made sure to stay in contact.  Don't panic.  But try to maintain open channels. 4) It took 6-7 weeks for me last year when I was negotiating. You definitely want to stay in contact and keep channels open, but not pester, either. I know it's a fine line. The timeline you described seems on schedule so don't panic."
"moratorium Has anyone given up hope of finding a TT job this year and more or less stopped applying for them for the rest of the academic year? I think I have spent so much time applying for jobs (and on this wiki) that it severely hindered my productivity, and was scolded by my advisor recently. I think I'm gonna put the job search on hold for a while. Besides, it's not like there's a lot more new ones coming up anyway. (1) It is kind of the end of the season anyway (although I just saw a great one on Friday I am going to apply for). (2) Agreed. I'm doing the same. But the advisor scolding is B.S.

Anonymous Quals suggest that there were more female hires than male hires. However, this is absolutely not true in the evolution field that I am familiar with. I wonder if it is possible that we as a community to revisit faculty jobs listed in eco evo wiki between 2014 and 2017 to get the true statistics of hiring. Since these hires were done, I don't think it violates one's privacy to list this piece of information. 2) It's defnitely not true in my circle of aquaintances, although it probably depends on the field. Of the people I worked with during my PhD and first postdoc, everyone who is now a PI is male. 3) This has already been done for the last 2 years by the Dynamic Ecology blog (described in several posts, search 'dynamic ecology faculty hires'). They find that >50% of recent hires are female, though there are some limitations to the dataset (see other comments on this wiki). They focused more on ecology than evolution jobs, though obviously there is a lot of overlap. I wouldn't be surprised if some sub-fields differ from the larger patterns, but my anecdocatal experience from grad school/postdoc friends and acquaintances matches the Dynamic Ecology results pretty well. 4) I hope everyone that is using 'their circle of friends' as support for or against trends in hiring practices are more rigorous in the methods they practice in their science. 5) I doubt it, judging from the wild speculation thrown around here, not to mention the nonchalance with which people suggest using this forum as some sort of data source. It is frightening. 6) I know Dynamic Ecology blog has done that. But she used the anon qual data, which may be biased. We do not know if the data bias exists, and if so, how much. Doing a research on the true hire than than relying on the anon qual will provide much accurate information. 3 again) @6, Dynamic Ecology did do a post using the anon qual data, but they also have a series of posts where they did exactly what the OP suggests (tried to identify the hires for every position listed on this site over the last couple years by looking at department web sites). It certainly isn't perfect, but the sample size is large and I haven't seen any good argument about why it should be biased in one way or another. I agree that the anon qual 'data' is pretty useless. 6 again) Thanks @3 for pointing out this. I will go to find and read the posts that you mentioned here. 7) https://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2017/10/02/newly-hired-tenure-track-n-american-asst-professors-of-ecology-are-59-women/ 8) the DE post used data from departmental websites and solicited emails, so I'd imagine that it's fairly accurate 8) OP here, thanks for the link from DE blog, which is a great read. It's a great effort that they have done so, and I really hope that we have similar statistical power for the hires in evolution field. 9) The DE post aligns closely with my own experiences in ecology over the last few years. This should be good news for ecos! Not sure about evo though.",ed 2) steve 3) joe,"Univeral design in the hiring process Universal design is being adopted in the classroom, whereby - among other principles - multiple means of action / expression are encouraged, with the understanding that some students do better speaking, some writing, etc. Is there any hope of this being adapted for the TT hiring process? I am an extreme introvert, but do work well with others; I am collegial and have had several successful scientific collaborations. The interview process as it currently exists (Skyping with a group of people, 3 straight days of conversation) is not where I shine. Any one else experience this? Do you think there is ever a chance of multiple formats being offered? Just like standardized testing, I feel like this interview format reflects how well people do at that specific format rather than how they might truly perform on the job. Are SCs overlooking some of the best candidates because they are introverts? 2) I wouldn't count on the standard interview process changing dramatically over any timeframe that would be relevant for your goal of landing a job. I think a huge percentage of us are introverts and not naturally good at interviewing. So, I think the best way to overcome this is to practice your interview skills. 3) Absolutely with the practice, #2! I'm thinking about this outside the context of myself. When all of us introverts (or you extroverts who know how wonderful working with us introverts can be) land jobs, perhaps we can work to make the hiring process more inclusive in the future! Who's in? 4) if u cant handle 3 days of conversations with interested parties, im not sure how you think you can be successful as a prof. the job is far harder than that, for introverts and extroverts alike. 5) I experience that too OP 6) @4, you seriously can't see a difference between the job of a professor and a series of 30 minute 'interviews' that involve making impressive small talk with strangers? Of course we have to do it and practicing helps, but there is totally disingenuous to deny that those types of interactions are much much easier for some people to pull off based on personality and that there is little reason to believe that doing those well is directly related to overall job performance (yes, I realize that some small parts of being faculty will be similar, but writing grants/papers, teaching, and advising have a much different structure than those short interactions). Two years ago I had an interview in which I was told afterwards that the committee agreed that I had the best record, the best research talk, and the best phone interview (which is different because it is easier to prepare answers to structured questions), but that I just wasn't perceived as 'excited enough' about the position in one on one interactions. It is hard not to interpret that as a popularity contest in which extroverts will always win over introverts, so I sympathize a lot with the OP here. Incidentally, I had a very similar experience at the grad student and postdoc application phase, but once I got into both of those positions I have been very successful and have lots of ongoing collaborations. I just think that these 30 minute 'interviews' are not very informative and are so vulnerable to various kinds of subconcious biases. I do agree with 2 though that none of this is likely to change anytime soon. 7) @6 what is the alternative? dont talk to people before hiring them? you cant be serious. 8) I agree that it's not really reasonable to do away with in-person interviews altogether (not sure if that was OP's suggestion though). I don't really think you can be an effective all-around professor if you aren't able communicate with people, and the in-person interview, while not perfect, is a good way to judge this skill. Plus, the on-campus interview is only one aspect of the overall interview process. You don't even get to this stage until you are a top three contender. I think there might be something to be said though for changing the standard 2-day meetining with 30+ people. 9) I agree, the campus interview schedule should just be toned down a bit. In my experience, I'm usually scheduled with 12+ hours of meetings/meals/socializing per day over several days, and I'm always completely wiped out for the last few hours of each day. It's hard to shine in your 9th straight hour of high-pressure small talk, especially for the extremely introverted. 6) @7 I did say that I don't see the culture changing anytime soon, but lots of industries outside of academia hire highly skilled people by evaluating the actual skills they are expected to use in the jobs rather than through a series of informal/kind-of-formal interview/kind-of-chats with people. If you describe the length and design of the academic interview to people unfamiliar with it they think it is crazy. I realize there are some reasons for it to be set up the way it is in academia, but the idea that interviews just have to be this way is simply wrong. 10) Also worth noting that academic culture in countries outside the US often involves many fewer of these type of interactions with shorter and more focused interviews overall (often with multiple candidates interviewing together) and (in some cases anyway) more transparent evaluation procedures. x2 11) OP here - thanks for your support @6 and others (except @4 - lol). It's certainly not that we introverts ""can't handle it."" I personally have had 3 fly-outs and I think they all went really well (still waiting to hear on all of them, but have gotten positive feedback) and I think I'd make a great professor. I'd just love some collective conversation about how we might be more inclusive in hiring when we're in charge. For example, perhaps a half-day team brainstroming session around an idea that could substitute for a half-day of 30-minute interviews could be informative? I agree that the skills demonstrated in the 30-minute interviews are valuable, and I wouldn't propose cutting them all together. Just like universal design in the classroom though, I think the entire process could benefit from considering different modalities of processing information and communicating. We'd all be better for it and we'd capture tthose introverts who have a LOT to bring to the table but that aren't as good at mimicking extroversion. x3 12) Interviewers in most other countries are far shorter and feel less of a stamina test as a result. My total interview process in Europe for multiple positions has been <3 hours. This has obvious downsides; you don't get a good feel for the department and they get less of a feel for you. But it avoids this problem, which does seem extreme. In what other job is an interview effectively a 16-hour x 3 day affair? 13) Not even MDs do this and they are real doctors. 14) I think chalk-talks are a good way to increase the diversity of interactions, similar to the brainstorming session that 11 suggests. 15) @13, I make this joke a lot too, but I recently learned that PhDs have a much longer history as doctors than MDs. It's only the last century, give or take, that MDs have had to go through an intensive training process like PhDs. 16) At this (sad) point, I think I have done every kind of interview under the sun, from 30 minute UK affairs to 3-day 14-hour-per-day marathons in the U.S. There is definitely a middle ground that I absolutely prefer, which is a 1.5 day visit, where the first afternoon includes the more formal committee interviews/seminars/chalk talks, and the second full day includes meals, tours, and 1-on-1 meetings with faculty, admin, and students. That is really more than enough time to suss out the department IMO. 17) OP here - update - this introvert got an offer in an expanding department, and I will absolutely implement this to the best of my ability when I'm on future SCs for our dept","I love that this board shows me jobs that I never would have found otherwise, but there's something gut wrenching about seeing that interviews have been scheduled or letters requested and then knowing you haven't been chosen. I find myself obsessively checking the comments of jobs I applied to so I can see if I haven't made it into the shortlist pool or on-campus interviews. This can't be good for my mental health. Does anyone else do this? I can't decide if it was better before I had this sheet so I could just sort of forget about the jobs I applied to then one day sort of assume that I didn't get the interview, as opposed to the gut punch of seeing that interviews were scheduled.2) everyone else does this. x9 3) I did the same thing last year and it became a real problem for me. I had to eventually make myself close the tab (which was always open before then), and make myself not open it anymore for the rest of that job-cycle. It made it easier for me to not obsess over it this job-cycle. Hang in there! 4) This sharing of job news (rather than job openings) was the original purpose of this board (here and before it moved to a google doc, I think it's been around in some form for about 15 years). 4) I landed my sweeet TT job 7 years ago. I was an obsessive checker then (4+ times/day) and I STILL occasionally come on here to poke around, when bored, out of habit. ","Relocation costs for postdoc? I received a 3 year postdoc offer in . The project has an immediate start date and I will need to relocate from North Carolina by the end of February. I am wondering if it would be reasonable/appropriate if I request for a relocation package since I will have to break my current apartment lease amongst other moving costs. Has anyone here received a relocation package as a postdoc? Is it an unreasonable request? 2) I think it's reasonable and asked for and recieved relocation $ in a postdoc position (NGO, not university) 3) Absolutely ask. x2 4) #1 again. Thank you! That gives me confidence to request for a relocation package. 5) I would ask, but don't expect a lot. I got $1000 which was only about half the total expense. 6) Yeah, any amount would help at this point. 7) Definitely ask. My university wasn't able to pay relocation costs, but they did increase my salary. 8) If it's NIH funded, I am fairly certain some amount is required to be offered--I want to say $500, though could be more. 9) I asked when relocating and was told no money was available.  Doesn't hur tto ask. 10) It's pretty common to get something. I got $750 a few years ago. But it might not be a standard part of an offer. I know other postdocs at my insitution did not get anything...but they also did not ask. 11) I was offered $1500 to cover moving costs and bridge healthcare, definitely worth asking 12) I asked on all my offers (3) and each time nothing was available. But I think it depends on the school/policy/funding. 13) I think I asked this question last year...couldn't be offered anything officially, but PI started my position 1 pay period earlier than I arrived, so I essentially got ~$1500 for moving. x2 14) glad to hear this is something most people get if asked; frustrated that I was essentially shrugged off when asking for (even just a little!) relocation money. Spent a good chunk of savings moving our family XC. 15) Yes, and savings are difficult to come by when raising a family on grad student salaries!"
"Lone Ecologist=Blown Ecologist Boo Hoo Hoo! I'm tired of reading about the ""Lone Ecologist"" and all you whiners bitching about it. If you get an offer, consider yourself lucky.  (1) Couldn't agree more... (2) me too!!! (3) I AM an ecologist, and I don't care if I end up ""Lone"" or not...a job is a job. If it sucks that bad, I can enter the market again, but until that point I can afford to feed my family. All of you who are worried about it...turn down the offer...hopefully I'll be right there behind you to take it. (4) Beggars can't be choosers. (5) But they can be whiners! (6) That's pretty obvious! (7) Trust me, if you were the lone ecologist, you'd be crying too. And not crying to the bank, crying from it! wah! (8) Give me the lone ecologist position, which would fit really nice with my wide experience. It is s waste to have a narrow trained ecologist take up those positions. (9) I agree, the days of hard-core, strict, narrow ecology are dead or slowly dying away. Ecologists are now broadly trained (or should be) in physiological, molecular, behavioral, phylogenetic, genetic, neurobiolgy, etc. techniques and apply this training to broad questions and systems, making the ""Lone Ecologist"" a good collaborator for labbies and benchies who are even vaguely interested in how organisms (even model ones) interact with the environment. If you're the lone ecologist, stop whining and do something about it: get some training and reach out to your.10) I'm a lone ecologist, and have been one for about 2 years.  Pretty positive experiences overall, no competition with other faculty for students, and a very handsome start-up since my school didn't have a feel for a typical ecologist start up and so I got one that was consistent with everyone else.  Would be nice to have more face time with other ecologists on a day to day basis, but I try to attend a few meetings per year, and have lots of other interactions with fellow ecologists (email, telephone, wiki, etc..). Most importantly I'm psyched to have a job at a time when people are having so much trouble getting permanent position.","Application deadlines What is the appropriate window for sending in an application when the announcement says ""review will begin on.."" or ""review of applications will continue until position is filled""?  I am asking because I was made aware of positions after the ""begin review date"" or post date -- these are for VAP positions at SLACs (not listed on the wiki).  Just trying to save myself embarrassment. Thanks! Email SCC and ask. (2, original poster) I sent an e-mail to the SC with my app attached, got a mysterious ""thanks, we got it and are currently interviewing"" response.  So, I guess they'll hang onto it if the interviews don't work out??",NA,NA,NA,"This is a question for other people in tenure-track positions who are job-hunting. How do you keep your colleagues from finding out? 1) TT Assistant Prof here, looking for greener pastures. There's really not much you can do. Just don't say anything. It turns out that I'm not the only one in my department looking for other positions.  I found out through the grapevine. 2) Ok, but how do you handle the Letters of reference thing? Surely that gets the word out. 3) in this market you are stupid to look for greener pastures.  There are none. 4) You're stupid not to look for greener pastures. 5)  You're both stupid heads.  ...but, seriously, there most certainly are greener pastures.  Good luck making it to one, though, as the job market is a beast as you all know.  The good thing about already being in a full-time position is that we can pick and choose more freely where we apply and can narrow down our searches to better places, which, do #3, really exist.6) Look, if your place is not a completely toxic s-hole, you are better to work on tenure and leave after.  Why?  Because you will eliminate any chance of tenure at the place where you are if anyone finds out, assuming its as bad as you think.  7) #6 I think is an exaggeration.  Unless you are 10 years post tenure and in a great place or otherwise have established roots in an area, there is always the expectation that people will look around for other jobs.  Snagging a job post-tenure is harder judging from the cases I know because you've spent 6 years in a place and may not want to leave, rather want to increase your current salary or get something you didn't ask for earlier.  8) Finding a job post tenure is also harder because there are so many more ads for Assistant prof than assoc or full prof.  Also, why stay miserable for 5 years if you could try and change your situation? 9)  I think it's funny that when I posted a couple of weeks ago that App State wanted to contact non-indicated references and my department chair that folks gave me a hard time about it and said it was just part of searching for a job and now this pops up again as I else's concern.  I just wanted to reiterate my experiences.  I'm a tenured Associate Prof and I hate where I am for so many reasons.  I think many of us take our first job, becuase we just don't have many options when were are right out of the gate.  I've been looking for new gigs for the last three years and have not been successful in getting an offer, but I've been short-listed many times and have interviewed many places.  NEVER did any potential employers indicate that they needed to talk to co-workers that I didn't green light or to my current department chair.  I think most places understand the politics and stigma attached to a prof that is looking for new job that might be applied to that person by current co-workers if they were to find out.  It changes the work environment big time and I think employers need to realize that the odds of them hiring this person may not be all that great, yet they are going to leave a wave of destruction and alert an entire department to the intentions of one person that is job hunting.  I don't think it's right. I think you can get references from a lot of other folks including those current co-workers that have been cleared rather than from folks that don't need to know this information.  Now, #3, I don't understand why you are here.  How do you know so much about whether or not there are or aren't greener pastures?  Are you currently in a TT position?  If not, I don't think you can speak to the question from a TT perspective.  If you are currently in a TT track position, then why are you on a job site if greener pastures do not exist?  Like I said above, I've interviewed several places over the last three years and several of the places that I interviewed were much better than where I currently am in so many ways.  Greener pastures are out there, but it's just really hard to get over the fence between where you are and where that greener grass is, so keep trying if you are in a bad spot and want out.  Lots of us are doing it and there are better options out there.  10) for #9 & #7.. do what you want.  when it backfires, don't say i did not warn you.  you better be very careful.  if you are in a bad place, there is a reason its a bad place, and usually, you will be targetted the first time I finds out.  i have enough first hand and second hand stories to know what you will face.  Like I said, do what makes you feel right, but you are treading dangerous waters. 11) #9 here, I guess I just don't understand why you are using this site #10.  Are you saying that once you are in a full-time TT position that you should never look for a new job??  You have me a bit baffled.  So, are you currently looking for a new job?  Are you currenlty in a full-time TT position?  Can you be more specific with your examples that suggest what we are doing is a bad thing?  I know that I'd rather not advertise far and wide at my current job that I want to leave, but why is it bad to look?  I don't understand your viewpoint and I wish you would enlighten us a bit more with real world examples and clarification, as I'd really find such information to be quite useful in helping me decide how to proceed with my search.  ...or are you just trying to scare away the folks that look better than you on paper?  ;)  12) Not too many look better than me on paper, so no, I'm not.  I'm giving you legit advice based on experience.  if you don't want the advice, move on. 13) Douche alert. 14) I second the Douce alert. Also, at my R1 (where I am postdoc) a number of faculty have applied for other positions eventhough they like their current institution. They have used other offers to get great deals here (I do think they were genuine in thinking of going somewhere else). I would move from one green pasture to another that is greener...It doesn't even have to be a move because you hate your current position. Also, I just interviewed at a SLAC and a good number of the older faculty had been at another insitution in a TT position. People move around a lot. I am a bit surprised about all the hate being piled up on people wanting greener pastures. This isn't 1952. People move jobs all the time.15) The funny thing is how vauge you are, #12.  If you know so much, give us concrete examples and also why the hell are you on a job site if you are so frickin' smart and so awesome? 16) you aren't exactly blurting out your name rank and serial number.  you are right, this is not 1952, and you know what?  people don't move around all the time.  in fact, the vast majority don't move at all.  Do a survey of departments.  pick 10 at random and see what percent moved.  you will find its very low adn the majority that have moved it was due to not making tenure or being let go rather than deciding to go.  no, they really don't move all over.  A few folks in R1s sometimes move, but even then it disrupts their own careers in research so much they typically don't.  Again, believe whatever, I'm not stopping you.  Find out for yourself as they say in the grapes of wrath. 17) Grapes of wrath? wow. I didn't realize things were that bad. I do know a decent (although not a majority) number of people who have changed insitutions. Small pond science blog has a post that is tangentially about this under 'Teaching universities as the farm league'. A lof anectodes of people switching institutions in that post. 18) I feel sorry for #10, evidently he/she has been in a bad place for a long time and wasn't smart enough to do anything about it, so has become or remained spiteful. 19) #10, i feel sorry for you because you are wrong. If leaving is your only choice, then do it.  However, you would be much better off getting tenure then bolting because if you got an offer you could negotiate a raise if you did not want the new gig.  however, if you get an offer now, you are forced to take it because they can and will contact your supervisor at that time.  that is where the trouble starts.  20) This discussion is glossing over all the other reasons why I would move that has little to do with the current institution. Two-body problems, family issues, bad location for raising kids, etcs. are all legit and important reasons why I would move. Could it ""backfired"" perhaps, but then it's likely that department is not one you'd want to stay in anyway. To answer the OP question, the way to do it is to now ask for Letters from your current department. If I does find out, tell the truth but keep the details at a minimum (""I found this amazing position in a better state/situation for my spouse/that has better schools for my kids/etc."" Hope that helps and good luck. 21) #20, this could work if you know everyone is sane and just.  however, you are not tenured and word gets around. It can be  huge risk. I also would not rely on what is written in a blog, their info isn't exactly dependable.  Here, i'll just grab three random schools:  WKU, CCSU, and UCB.  2/3 of these are in less preferred locations for most candidates, and none have a pattern of Assistant Professor or post-tenure faculty leaving.  I challenge you to just randomly grab three schools where these things do happen.  So, changing schools is not in any way common.  It may be necessary at times, and each of you might be in one of those situations that warrants change for good reason.  But anyone who tells you its common-place is ill-informed or a blatant liar.  27 faculty  20 tenured (almost all been there since tenure) 7 Asst profs A = started in 2013 right out of postdoc B = started 2007 right out of postdoc C = started 2009 right out of postdoc D = started in 2008 right out of postdoc E = started 2013 right out of PHD F = started 2010 right out of PHD  Central CT ST 12 faculty  9 tenured (almost all since tenure) 3 asst prof A = started in 2012 B = started in 2013 C = started in 2010  CSU-Bakersfield 10 faculty 8 tenured 2 asst prof A = started in 2013  B = started in ??? but been there since PHD.  21) But the real question isn't how many folks have stayed, but how many have stayed because they feared trying to move would be the kiss of death.  I don't think that's the norm.  I'm in a TT position and have been involved in two hires, and in both cases we get multiple applications from Assistant Professors looking to move, and they had very supportive Letters from colleagues, all of which said something basically like ""We'd live to keep him/her here, but we understand why he/she is leaving, and our loss will be your gain.""      22) 20 here again. My experience…I’ve been at 3 different schools (MS, PhD, TT) in three different states. My MS advisor tried to move at least twice while I was there (got offers but used it to negotiate better deals, they did eventually move). My PhD advisor tried to move a few times, got an offer but decided to stay. My current school, 3 of the 30 faculty have come from other schools (two post tenure, one prior to tenure), and two have left (one was pre-tenure). Others have also tried to leave (pre and post). I also have 3 TT colleagues in my cohort who tried to leave (2 successfully pre-tenure). So perhaps I am an outlier when it comes to this sort of data but I’ve also been on two searches (and of the 5 total candidates we interviewed 3 were already Asst profs and pre-tenure). In the end, if you are in a department that would view I trying to leave in a negative light and you don’t get tenure because of it (a lame reason IMO) then you have a greater incentive to go elsewhere. I’ve never heard of any bad voodoo coming from applying to other positions.  23) I wrote comments above somewhere... a Ass Hats should want to have faculty that are sought by other institutions because it's a sign that they have market value.  No Ass Hats or any other kind of institution likes to have faculty that are not competitive. 24) Universities want faculty to fit in their culture and will stay and make the place better.  Every department is like that.  It appears you have seen people try to move.  However, don't base it on your limited observations, base it on a real investigation of the situation.  Above, I just randomly grabbed three schools that popped in my head.  Why?  because I have plenty of experience to know most schools have stable faculty.  The idea that you are going to start in a Midmajor or libearl arts school and work your way up to an R1 is largely wrong.  Why?  Because the teaching loads and service requirements at a midmajor are night and day different from the responsibilities at an R1.  The few people who do this are remarkeable and exceptional.  The biggest reason people don't move is fear they will be slighted.  You know why that fear exists?  I'll let you guess. 25) 20 here again. In response to 24, most of the moves I've seen or have been attempted have been lateral or downward, not upward, so on that I agree, but that does not take away from the fact that people do at least try to move to improve their situation (academic or otherwise). The premise that people don't move is at best weak (you offer 3 ""random"" schools, and I would offer my 3 schools are no less so. I also don't know what being ""slighted"" has to do with anything. 26) #23 here, Letters of places simply popping in your head are not random, but you probably know that.  Of the 4 universities with which I've had an affiliation, about 25% of the faculty either left or arrived from a TT position.  So unless you really want to make a real study, and survey 100 schools or so,, you aren't adding anything new here other than paranoia.    27)  Look, I gave you some advice.  take it or leave it.  i couldn't care less what you do, in fact, you lose your job its open for I else, you stay, you are not competing with people in the market.  So, it matters not.  If you want to believe whatever fantacy or facts you believe, go for it.  Here is a news flash for you.  Most people who change schools do so because they lost their former job or knew they would lose it.  No one tells you this.  28) #27 -- Based on my experience, this simply is not true. I have had similar experiences to those described here (granted I am currently a postdoc and not in a TT). However, the people that I have seen move (or almost move) have not been in danger of losing their jobs. Often it is quite opposite. Also, those that have gotten offers from other institutions have not sufferred from department-level (or chair-level) acrimony as a result. I do see that some departments could be horrible places and they would spiteful if they found faculty applying elsewhere. So yes...how to proceed as a TT faculty as you are applying may vary among schools. Also, the notion of worrying that you will be slighted if you leave is ludicrous. My sanity and what is best for my family comes well before what a department chair should feel should I leave. You are seeming to advocate that as general rule, people should not move unless they are in truly horrible situations. Do you really believe that it is unwise to be open to opportunities that may benefit your career or family? I think this is bad advice. 29) #23, #26 here, I think this discussion has been valuable...my take is that it's best to act professionally in these situations, chances are that your department will act professionally if you do. It's usually best to keep your cards close to your chest, as in any profession...think how you might react if one of your close colleagues may leave of course there is disappointment that things don't work out, etc., but at the same time, any rational person will respect others' intentions or personal needs should better opportunities arise.  The advice is be friendly and professional while you look for greener pastures, but at the same time realize that you may be in the current pastures for longer time if things don't work out, so dont burn any bridges prematurely, because if you don't find a job that suits your needs, then you look like an idiot and then they will take it out on you. 30) #28 here...I think that #29 said it well. There is nothing wrong with moving insitutions. However, leaving can create a considerable headache as it may mean the loss of resources (via your used-up start-up funds etc) and will mean another search. Further, the department may lose its faculty line should you leave. These are not good enough reasons for one to stay but they are good enough reasons to act professionally and see it from their angle as well. 31) #29..Academia rational?  Academia professional?  Hang around it a while and you discover that the vast majority are rational professionals, but a large enough number are irrational and unprofessional to do damage.  32) Yes, #31, you've provided an excellent example to prove your own point. 33) sure #32, I'll name names and positions.  Have you checked out the Universities to hate page on the wiki?  I think there are plenty on there. 33) There are a lot of unprofessional people in academia and elsewhere. Also, there are some truly toxic universities and departments. However, I don' think that this is the majority. Also, in my experience department chairs are usually nice, rational folks. It is a tough job and you have be able to listen to a lot of different faculty. Those who are really difficult often don't last in that job. Yes, some will share a horror story about a chair -- but I am talking about generalities. I still think the advice about moving depends on why one would move and the specifics of your current institution. In general, fear of retaliation for looking for better opportunities is a poor reason to not look and apply to positions that will benefit you or your family.  34) it's always tough if you are untenured assistant prof, but it is not uncommon to apply for other jobs as you near tenure.  People who have had a really strong first few years are often in good positions to move 'up', especially if they had decent start-ups and not too heavy teaching, bc 1)  they may have been really productive, and 2) they can still apply for all of those jobs advertised at the ""Assistant"" level (which are the vast majority, even more so these days).  Your move may be lateral (R1-R1, SLAC-SLAC), but it may be decidedly 'up' for you for other reasons: location, resources, pay, proximity to family, prospects for spouse etc).  It happens a lot. Generally, faculty will be sad you are leaving but happy for you and wish you well. I wouldn't say anything if you are just applying. If you get an on-campus interview it is trickier.  Depends on whether you think here is someone in the dept, especially if it's is a close colleague, will likely hear through the grapevine.   More often than not, everyone is so busy that they won't notice or read anything into you being gone for a couple of days to give a talk. It happens all the time. But is is where you have to make a decision. You can also tell your close colleagues after the fact that you interviewed.  But most often, people are pretty mum about it until they get an offer.  At that point, you have to talk to your chair, dean etc bc they should have the opportunity to counter-offer.  This works in your favor as long as you are professional about it.  AFTER you have tenure you can apply / interview all you want, but the problem is most jobs are at Assistant Prof, and if advertised as such, you will probably have to give up tenure and go back to Assistant for a short review period (2 years is typical).  You have to decide if the move is worth that. It might very well be, but it is an added stress on top of relocating, setting up a new lab.  One thing I would emphasize is that moving after you have tenure is often more challenging bc many places won't consider you seriously for assistant prof positions, and there are many fewer offered at associate/full, with associate probably the least common. So tenure can be a double-edged sword.  Tenure at somewhere you don't really want to be long term can actually be not such a great thing to have.   But, main thing is that there is always some turnover, and the bigger the department the more you will see.  Very good candidates are likely to take positions good TT positions in the current market, even though said position may not be their dream job/location.  So you will lose a few if those.  And that is too bad, bc in my experience it usually the top people that move (much more common than the case of a floundering assist prof moving on bc they know they prob won't get tenure).  The good news is, there are lots of excellent candidates looking for good TT jobs, so see people can usually be replaced by someone good.  Two downsides --the school the person left  might lose the position for budgetary reasons, and post-docs are often competing with people who already have TT jobs (and in some cases tenured profs) for positions advertised at assistant level.  Often a faculty can take a leave of absence for up to 2 yrs, which potentially allows them to go back to their first institution if things dont work out at their new one. But this is rarely done.  Most people decide to make a clean break (not burn bridges, but make a clean break).  This is the fair thing to do for the department you are leaving too, bc if one takes a leave it can tie up that faculty line and keep them from doing a search for a replacement.  Their are some good advice forums on the chronicle of higher Ed on these topics.  I'd say you can apply, but be professional about it, not shout it from the rafters that you are applying for other positions, and if you get an in person interview (or probably better, after you get an offer), then be courteous and respectful in explaining this to your chair & dean and ask to meet with them.  ","OMG, had interview, they said probably I'd here something within a week. It has been a week. Going nuts with anticipation and fear that an offer has been made to the other candidate...  B) Me too. Every time I get a phone call I get this big adrenaline spike...oh, its the Apple repair guy. Yes, this sucks.  I've never been so attached to my phone. Ever. 3) It's email for me because I'm 7 hours different and figure they'll email me. Everytime I see some junk email pop up I almost have a heart attack for a second. I WISH I was expecting a phone call - I get way fewer of those. :/","Letters vs. names Had an on-campus interview at a Christian college recently where I was directly asked about faith by the college president, and indirectly asked about it by others on the search committee (usually they just made clear in various ways that they were of the particular faith that the college was affiliated with and kind of waited to see what I might say about faith). I'm an agnostic humanist. I avoided the conversation with the SC members, but when asked directly, I said I was a humanist and talked about paralells between my beliefs and theirs, etc. I didn't get the job. So, what h.ave others done about this? How do you answer the faith question if you aren't Christian or are just of a different faith than the school? I'm really concerned about this because 1. I just had a nice Skype interview with another religion-affiliated college and might have an on-campus soon and 2 I want to be at a SLAC, and so many of them are religiously affiliated. Thoughts? Advice?  3) It seems incredibly unfair to you and to the school to be disingenuous about potential religious conflicts. If faith is THAT important at a certain college that it comes up in the interview, how is it going to be each and every day when you are on campus??? I am currently at a Catholic school, and it's no biggie here (despite the crucifix in all the labs, etc.). However, today I just decided to not apply to Pepperdine, even though I am pretty comfortable around Evangelical christians. Frankly, I didn't want to have to debate intelligent design everyday for the next 20 years. And if things don't work out, how likely are you to land another job having been (for better or worse) associated with a very forthwright Christian school? That's my current thinking on the matter. 4) To me, this is in part a legal question. Some christian colleges are acting like ""colleges"" when it comes to using government resources, etc...., but are acting like churches when it comes to HR decisions. If this college is taking in federal/state grants for construction, etc.. then you could file a complaint. If the school appears to be actively rejecting federal/state money, then they are probably taking the ""we are really a church"" route, in which case, you have no legal recourse. However, in the latter case, that still doesn't make their behavior ethical. My suggestion to you is that if you really wanted the job, and the school was upfront/honest about wanting a ""christian,"" you should have lied your ass off, then lie for the next X years, get tenure, and then and only then, be honest and tell all your colleagues your true religious non-affiliation.  5) I would never had applied to such a place; if you dont consider yourself a true Christian, you'd never be happy with those people or they'd never be happy with you.  My guess is the latter is more likely because you'd be in the minority.  Your life would be miserable because you'd never be allowed in their circle. Especially if they are evangelicals.  Catholics are a different story. 6) Oh my god, I'd rather collect cans. 6) Not surprisingly, I think most of the knee-jerk answers here aren't going to do much good for you. If you like the teaching emphasis, which some religiously-oriented schools are quite good at providing, and you can comfortably and intellectually discuss with students why your beliefs differ from theirs, go for it. You may miss out on some jobs, but there are colleges that will hire you and value your sincerity and committment. At some (not all) of those colleges, they are fairly open to something a couple notches down from Richard Dawkins. But shielding your true beliefs will probably be much more wearying than you might think (and being unemployed is also wearying, I acknowledge). In short: be yourself; there are options; best of luck. OP here) Thanks all for your thoughts. I also didn't apply to Pepperdine, but I do appreciate their clarity on the matter of religion at their school that allowed me to make the decision not to apply. They wanted a faith statement, for goodness sake! At the school where this happened, it was not at all apparent that it would be such a thing from the job posting, the department website, or the school website. I have friends who are atheist or agnostic teaching at religious SLACs and they say it is a non-issue at each of their schools. I don't think evolution vs. creationism would have been an issue because several of the faculty were evolutionary biologists and reading up on the religion showed that most believe in evolution and science, so I didn't have any fears about that. I also genuinely liked all of the people in the department that I met. They didn't seem to be overly conservative. I honestly don't mind what people believe as long as they don't force it on other people or do bad things because of it, so I personally didn't forsee having issues getting along. I would absolutely never just lie until tenture. How on earth would one manage that in a small department in a small town? I would have actually had to start going to church, and that's definitely not going to happen. I hope the person who suggested lying about it was joking. In any case, frustrating, but it happened. I'm more interested in trying to figure out how to handle this differently or better if I get the on-campus interview I'm anticipating at another religion-affiliated school. This one's Catholic though, so if you guys are right, it sounds like it should be ok. At face value though, I have to say that Catholicism (I was raised Catholic, too) seems a lot more conservative that the protestant religion of the other school where I applied. OP again) I DID get the interview at the Catholic place!  8)  Congrats on the interview.  At the Catholic school, I would start by researching the order (e.g. Jesuit, Benedictine, Franciscan, etc.) that the school is affiliated with, which might give you an idea of the culture that may or may not have developed there.  OP) Thanks! I've done that, and looks pretty good to me. OP) Interview went well! No faith questions. OP) Got offer!! 9) Congrats!!",Going crazy. This wait is mindnumbing.  x2 2) If is always tough when you are in your first year on the job market. After that you are just numb.,^^f'n amazing ,"I hope the venter from 10/17/16 is OK! x2  2) Lol, I think someone deleted the post. 3) What are you all talking about?  4) look down 1 cell vvvv","Anon Quals More folks should add their info.. This sample size is tiny, consider how many people probably check this site. Given that people are trying to use this data to draw conclusions about the job market.. lets give them better data!","The salaries people are getting on the negotiations tab, even for top tiered SLACs, are bad. That has created a somewhat pleasant cognitive dissonance for me, regarding academic jobs. 2) Could it be that the market is so bad, that salaries can actually go down? 3) Two of the SLACs listed there seem like pretty good starting salaries to me for a SLAC. The other two are low but look like they are probably in lower cost areas. None are in northeast or west coast where I would expect the highest salaries in general. 4) it depresses me that a lot of faculty job salaries are pay cuts from a well-paid postdoc 5) I agree salaries are a little low but they are for 9mo correct? The lowest salary currently listed would = $5.3k/mo, whereas a post-doc making $60k/yr = $5k/mo. I assume the lower salaries could be boosted by teaching during the summer? Just trying to look at the bright side. 6) You could get a little more teaching in the summer, but that also eats up the only time that you have to get research done at some of those schools. The 9 month thing is also kind of a joke since most people are realistically working all 12 to meet tenure expectations. Of course you could actually get a boost by winning grants that have summer salary written in, but that is far from guaranteed and unless you are NIH funded you likely wouldn't be able to put more than a month of summer salary on the grants anyway. I do think, though, that even those low paying faculty jobs will typically have better benefits (retirement, health insurance, etc) than even most 'good' postdocs. Plus I'd be willing to pay a fair amount for stability at this point...7) #5, 60k/yr postdoc would only be in places like Boston, NYC or SF. Most postdocs I know get paid around 40+ before FLSA and around 50 now. The salaries listed for the SLACs are for places where the living costs are low as mentioned by the OPs themselves. I agree that the salaries are low for folks like us who invested a lot of time in our career but conflating a high (or senior) postdoc salary in an expensive city and a stable position in a low cost place does not really help. 8) Both of my postdocs were in mid-priced areas (not the coasts, but not flyover country), and I was paid mid 50s. The salaries definitely seem low. x2  9) I think 60 isn't crazy for a post-doc (I made that right out of the gates as a post-doc in the mtn west), 9) 60 for a new postdoc is substantially higher than NIH scale, even after they made adjustments. East Coast here. My institution sticks to the scale. 10) I had two postdocs, one at UVA (33k) and one at Cornell (38k). That was back in 2008-2010, but still. Not very much. I make 54k (9mo) now as an assistant prof at a public univ in the midwest. Still not very much. Cost of living where I am is really low, though. Either way, don't choose ecology as a career if you want to earn the big bucks. It's a labor of love. 11) #5 here, $60k was best/highest case scenario. I was not saying that was the average for most post-docs in any specific area, I was also not conflating post-doc salaries in Boston, NYC, or SF with salaries in lower cost of living places, that was your assumption. The point I was making (for some encrouagement to myself if nothing else) is that even though salaries are low for assistant professors, it is still an increase from our post-doc days (which I'm still in). 12) #7 here, sorry #5, I misunderstood your intentions. I say this from experience after a long postdoc. Even if you get paid higher as a postdoc than a newly minted asst prof with a lower salary, the stability (for the first five years as a tenure track member) is much more desired than being at the end of the postdoc where funding is uncertain and your future is uncertain. At the end of my postdoc, I was willing to go to a place that pays less than what I am making as a postdoc just for the stability of it. 13) I don't think there's any debate about the superiority of a nice permanent job, it just seems reasonable that these permanent jobs would include higher salaries than a term position. NSF postdoc fellowships pay 54k plus a 15k expense budget and I think Smith fellowships and other comparable programs are about the same 14) If you think those salaries are low, you should check out the meagre salaries at R1 equivalents in the UK & elsewhere... 15) Three things; i) salaries in the UK and many EU countries are roughly equivalent to the US, ii) there is no such thing as an employee exempt from getting overtime (an exploitative labor policy unique to the US) and because of this, professors work 36-40 hour work weeks and iii) The UK has the largest higher education union in the world, protecting and advocating for faculty members. Because of these three factors, work in the UK and much of the EU is unquestionably better, and this is before factoring the higher level of available services offered by many universities in Europe, including childcare. The main downside for leaving the US is that there is more research funding available here, but the odds are, you won't get any of that anyway, and if you do, you have to work 60+ hours a week writing grants on top of your other duties as an AP at a school like a SLAC. Oh, and there are no 'nine-month' contracts (another uniquely exploitative practice of the US) in which you work for 12 months but get paid for nine *bonus reason American academics sucks. Oh wait, one more reason, the tax bill that will pass this month in congress will tax US academic endowments, tuition waivers, research income, decrease individual eduction tax credits...etc. 16) I disagree with #15. Salaries in the UK for AP equivalent are way lower than in the US. I recently had a relatively well paid Lecturer position in the UK and it paid around 40k pounds. I felt I had a better salary years before as a postdoc at Cornell. Another main problem in Europe is that in most universities you get a table, a chair and a computer and that's it, you need to start from scratch, the start-up package seems to be a US thing. If you are lucky and you get a grant you can start doing research, otherwise you are screwed (assuming you need funding to run a lab) 17) Yeah #15, continental Europe is one thing but the salaries and facilities in the UK are a joke. And I haven't noticed the shorter working hours. And then there's the whole REF/TEF nonsense. Not saying it's an awful place to work, there are definitely advantages, but I definitely wouldn't start with salary or benefits. 18) Why would a lecturer need anything more than a desk and a chair? 19) I agree with 15, here is a study https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2012/03/22/new-study-analyzes-how-faculty-pay-compares-worldwide 15) Yeah, so, depending on what year you were a lecturer, you earned between 53.5 and 60K dollars a year for a lectureship, that is the same salary for a lecturer in the US, if not slightly higher. Currencies require an exchange rate to compare. 20) Lecturers are the equivalent of Assistant Professors. That said, most people I knew in my department in the UK arrived at 9 after dropping off kids and left at around 5. You typically don't fund your students from your own money in the UK, and their stipends come with some consumable money. They also don't get exploited by being forced to TA instead of getting their projects done, and there's no ""I get to decide when you graduate"" nonsense. 20) Correct me if I'm wrong, but what is called ""Associate Professor"" at the University of Oxford will give you about $51,000. Factor in whatever you want (and the cost of living anywhere near Oxford), and I just don't see a comparison with an equivalent U.S. institution. (https://www1.admin.ox.ac.uk/finance/epp/payroll/scales/academicsalaryscales/) 21) Looks like there's a new job under the negotiations tab with a higher salary and startup that is also in a low cost of living area.  And to diverge to the rest of this conversation, I don't think the currency conversion matters.  Theoretically we're all being paid in the same currency of the location where we're buying things, so dollars pounds and euros wouldn't need to be converted 22) $51K = 38,862 pounds. Doesn't seem any more affordable. 23) LOL if the currency conversion doesn't matter, why would you even list a salary in the first place, and how could we ever know what is equitable? Makes no sense. 24) You make pounds in the UK and spend in pounds, you make dollars in the US and spend in dollars.  So why would it make sense to convert a UK salary to dollars unless that person was spending in dollars? 25) I don't think you understand how exchange rates work 24, and what 23 was saying was, if they don't work that way, how could you compare making 'only 40k pounds' to anything in America. Basically, you can't argue that 40k pounds is low, and then say that the salary isn't comparable because exchange rates don't mean anything. A macroeconomics course in any liberal arts school should allow you to learn about nominal and real exchange rates, and how they represent perchasing power parity. Boom. Roasted. OP) Trevor's axiom. 26) <- true but please don't delete my comments (not sure who it was). We can all do without snide comments. OP) Sorry, wasn't trying to be snide, just pointing out how my offhand thought expanded in ways I never thought possible, which reminded me of Trevor's axiom, also, not sure what or who's comment got deleted? 27) Sorry OP, I was pointing out ""Boom Roasted"" is a snide comment this isn't needed. My original comment about it was deleted.","selection criteria When an ad states that you must respond to a list of selection criteria in order to have your application considered, do you typically make a numbered, point by point list of responses, or proceed normally with your research statement and hope that the committee finds all of the points they outlined? 2) This typically goes in the cover letter or a separate document or form if specified. You want to make it very obvious. 3) @2 Thanks! 4) Often this is covered in your cover letter.  I personally like when the candidate uses the language from the job announcement and bolds those words in the cover letter.  Really helps if you have to read 70-100 packets.  5) If it's in Australia or New Zealand, selection criteria absolutely need to be addressed individually in their own document. List each criterion as a heading, and spend half a page to a page on each. Keep the cover letter brief and do not send a research or teaching statement - the statement of claims against selection criteria is all that they will consider. They may not even be allowed to look at other documentation that you send if you haven't addressed each selection criterion explicitly and individually. (Note this has started to change just in the last year and some universities in Australia no longer follow this model, but it's pretty entrenched at most).","I didn't even get a phone interview at my alma mater... it feels like a punch to the gut. I can come up with a million reasons why (it's a SLAC, I don't have much teaching experience; my research is resource intensive and not particularly undergraduate friendly; it probably appears from the outside that I'm building a large R1-style research program), but that doesn't make it hurt any less or mean I didn't really really really want that job 2) Sorry to hear. I have been rejected from my BS, MS, and PhD alma maters! 3) sorry to hear that @1-2, I've also not even been short-listed at my BS/MS and Ph.D. universities. 4) I'm sorry to hear that. However, you might want to think about tailoring your application more when you apply to different types of positions. For a SLAC you need to make sure you are discussing research you can do with resources that are realistic (varies a lot between places!) and that CLEARLY will involve undergraduates and even data that can be collected by students in courses. Don't use the same research statement for a SLAC that you'd use for an R1. 5) Jeremy Fox from Dynamic Ecology here. For broader context: N. American TT faculty positions in ecology and allied fields are hardly ever filled by someone with a degree from the hiring institution: https://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2018/10/09/tenure-track-n-american-ecology-faculty-searches-rarely-hire-someone-with-any-current-or-past-connection-to-the-hiring-institution/. Obviously, those data don't tell you anything about whether or how having a degree from the hiring institution affects your odds of getting hired, all else being equal. FWIW, my own admittedly-anecdotal experience is that having received a degree from the hiring institution typically doesn't matter for search outcomes one way or the other. Re: customizing your application for the type of hiring institution, most applicants do that, and most search committee members want applicants to do that, especially search committee members at less research-intensive institutions: https://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2018/07/24/how-much-do-you-and-should-you-tailor-your-ecology-faculty-job-application-to-the-hiring-institution-poll-results-and-commentary/ 6) OP here... thank folks for the kind words. @4: Believe me, I have a very different set of application materials for SLACs. But that doesn't cover up my lack of teaching experience (I did not have to TA during my PhD and didn't realized not TA-ing was a mistake until later), or the fact that I haven't even really managed to convince myself my research is doable without access to a BSL2 lab (which would have been the case for this particular job). I'm very much aware that I probably wasn't actually a good candidate for the position, but wanted to let off some steam anyway. 7) Sorry to hear that. I've been outright rejected by my BS alma mater for three jobs now, and was rejected after an on-campus visit at my PhD alma mater. That one really stung. I tried to make it clear that working there would be more than a job to me, and I would give 110% until retirement to make that university a better place. They didn't care, and hired someone from outside the country. 8) @7 is there some distinction to you between ""anyone that's not me"" and ""someone from outside the country""? Seems unnecessary....X5 9) @1 that happened to me too.  But I got the nicest rejection letter from my old prof so it lessened the sting.  You will find your academic home 10) #7 here. The point I was trying to make is that in the interview process, I tried to convey that my familiarity with the university and region would be an asset (this was a teaching position at a state school with majority in-state students). I tried to sell that I was uniquely-positioned to relate with the student body at that school, having attended there and grown up in the region. However, based on the hire they made (someone from far outside the region), that was not something they appeared to value in the final hiring decision. That's all. I meant nothing discriminatory, and I apologize. 11) No need to apologize, some of us understood the context. X2 12) Why is ecology like this? I never hear genuinely convincing arguments as to why it's intellectually (or emotionally) heathy to move all the f around? I'm a little tired in general of profs and universities being PC police on behavior, but treat people abhorently or subscribe to Byzanine value systems as these. PS - also rejected from BS, MS and PhD institutions perhaps multiple times, but have awesome job at great R1 elsewhere? It's so weird. I feel your pain 1!",Second wind? ,"I hate how I have to play nice with my toxic phd adviser because I need reference letters 2) and unfortunately that doesn't go away once you leave if you stay in research  3) Submit at least a few apps without listing that phd advisor.  Not all but at least a few.  4) I'm sorry OP. I feel your pain. 5) I did the same with my former toxic advisor because I needed their letter but I finally got a TT Asst Prof position and haven't talked to them in years and would be happy to never to talk to them again. 6.) I had an extremely toxic postdoctoral advisor. I do not use him as a reference for anything. I had heard stories that he sabotaged people in their letters, so I chose not to use him. Hopefully, it's not that bad, but solidarity. It's not fun at all, but I would recommend not using them if you can, and cultivate relationships with supportive committee members and postdoc advisors. 7) Solidarity indeed. My postdoc advisor told me (and the other postdoc) that he was writing one of us a good letter, but not the other. Didn't say which. The other person got a job. I moved to a better postdoc and also don't talk to that person at all. 8) WTF?! 9.) So many horror stories with crud advisors...  10) My advisor told all of us he'd write us supportive rec letters then we all found out our letters were terrible and negative.  I stopped listing him on my apps and finally got a job.  11) Wow, I feel lucky. I never had any doubt that eith my phd or postdoc advisor was writing anything but very nice letters (even if I ddin't feel I always deserved it). Makes me curious whether you were able to foresee a difficult relationship or not. I always tell students looking into gra schools to do what tehy can to find out if the advisor will be a good fit for them, but I know it's not always easy! 12) Breaking the control of toxic advisors on our careers seems to be a necessary part of eliminating hostility in academia. Perhaps the younger generation will do something about it. Allowing applicants to not use a reference and not holding it against them as a red flag seems to be a good start. 13.) #6 again, well, I have not had the best luck in the job search, but I hope that's not why. With the competitive nature of things, I can't help but worry that even the tiniest deviation from perfect however out of one's hands can be the difference. From what I am seeing, toxic relationships happen at all levels, but competition is that fierce...*goes to the positive affirmations page*. 14) op here, just to clarify, I'm 3 years post phd. I need to list my adviser because they are well-known in my subfield and well-liked because they only punch down. The situation is what it is and there aren't really ways to make it better, which is why I'm here on the venting tab.  10) Stay strong, OP.  And keep submitting those apps.  15) @14 rest assured, your advisor's poor behavior is known among their peers and they are not well-liked because of it. 16) I never used my harasshole postdoc boss as a reference, ever, even though he's well-known. He's also known internationally for being a harasshole. 17) did you get a job?","Salary negotiation info!

"Job hunting season I know all schools are different but, generally, when do schools stop advertising positions?  And, when do they start? In other words what's the time frame of the job hunting ""season""? Thanks! 1) While most ads for TT positions go out between September and February, I've seen ads out at early as August, and as late as May (with a June deadline). June-July is usually dead, since it is difficult to interview when most of the department is not in town. (1.5) in most years the peak for deadlines is somewhere between October through December. However, in bad years, there is typically a secondary peak in March, as has occurred this year, in 2007-2008, 2004-2005, and 2001-2002. This year is weird in that January had more deadlines than either November or December, and March has been unusually strong compared to the rest of this decade. The Physiological Ecology job board has officially had more postings this year than last year (182 vs 180), and last year had a large number that were cancelled. Unfortunately, a lot of those early posts this year were reposts from last year. (2) What causes that secondary peak? Is it schools waiting to confirm that funding is available? If so, it will probably occur in bad years, but not abysmal years like 2008-2009. (3) I don't know for sure, I suspect that what you said is it. I have been following this for more than a decade and it seems to be the same every time. In 2008-2009 I suspect any pattern is hidden by the inability of us to detect canceled positions. A lot of those that were posted in the fall got canceled whereas the spring posts seemed to continue on. I double checked and 19 schools readvertised the same or very similar job description this year from last year, and two readvertised the same post as a visiting slot. So, that is 19/180 = >11% of last year's posts were readvertised this year and so far 19/182 = 10% of this years posts are readvertised from last year. I suspect that that last year's cancellations could have been as high as 20% based on my applications and it is believable that only about half of those cancelled last year got readvertised this year. 
(4) Typically post #1.5 is correct, but I would add that there is a small spike in March/April as people get offers for other jobs leaving departments to either put in for a 1 year VAP to cover those created holes, or (more rarely) a full time TT to replace the lost faculty. Also, many more Community College jobs show up in the spring than SLACs and R1/R2s.","salary negotiation I was flat out told the salary was ""not very negotiable"".  I got a decent first offer (mid 60s, 9 month, RU/H, ""average assistant professor salary"").  Should I still negotiate?   (1) - more info. I am female. I know ""average salary"" for men is ~3K higher than my offer. (2) Yes. They said ""not very negotiable,"" not ""not negotiable."" I would add 3K (or 4) to their offer and see what happens.(3) It is an offer (which means that you have the power) so NEGOTIATE using exactly what you just wrote. Pretty indefensible on their part. Add 5K (4) I agree with #3! They say women's salary is consistently lower because they don't negotiate strongly enough (3) here again, provide some justification for the counter offer, i.e. number of years in a postdoc*1K , if you have extensive teaching experience, if you are bringing in existing projects/funds etc. (5) Find out EXACTLY what the other people in your department are making; do not rely on national/regional/subject averages. Most state have searchable university payroll databases. If your's does not, call the university library and ask for the information. If it's a private university; you may be out of luck. I thought I was being low-balled, and it turns out I'm getting more than some people who have been there for years and that causes some tension. Some chairs you can trust, some you cannot; unfortunately you can't tell which is which until it's too late. (6) OP - Dean explicitly told me that he was offering current average salary of assistant professors (I supposed dean could have lied, but offer is ~1.5K over average reported last year in Chronicles, so inclined to believe it). I really don't want to be a pain (and the offer is good), but also don't want to be stupid and not negotiate. (7) Normally, I would expect there to be higher salary for men because there are more oder men hanging around than older women as a rule. However, it sound like that is not the case here, I'ld ask for more period!!!! (8) It's a negotiation! Ask for more! All they can say is no. (9) The average was for assistant professors only (OP), so all pre tenure (so ""older men hanging around"" should not be the explanation). (10) yes, assistant professors can be tenured, it happens, especially if the candidate does not have a Ph.D. I know of at least half a dozen cases without looking. (11) considering that this is 20K more than my Associate professor pay at my school, I think you should be freaking thrilled! (but still, you should be in line with those at your Uni). 12) OP - I am ""freaking thrilled""! :) Absolutely thrilled, actually. But don't want to let the thrill of doubling my little post-doc salary cloud my judgement on this ""game"". Actually wish that salary was just what the salary was. (13) I hesitate to comment on this because a bunch of posters are making it a feminism issue or a ""stick it to the administration"" issue, but I agree with 8.  I'm anything but an expert...I just got my first job after my first interview, but I tried to negotiate a tiny bit.  The important question, in my opinion, is whether their offer is good enough.  If it is, then any extra is icing on the cake.  If it isn't, then definitely negotiate, but be prepared to walk away.  In my case, the dean made an offer, I asked if there was any wiggle room (based on median salaries posted on Chronicle), he said no and explained how they calculate their salaries.  Being ABD, I didn't expect to start at the median anyway and the original offer was good enough, so, short of calling him a liar (and I don't think he was), the negotiation was over at that point, so I took the job.  I'm a white male with no experience with gender discrimination (or any other kind), but I say just ask for a reasonable amount more and see what happens.  There doesn't have to be an ulterior motive...you want more and they want to give less...duh.  Your last comment (#12) makes me think you hate haggling, just like me.  Ask for a bit more and accept their answer.  Don't stress out if you really could be happy with the original offer.  (14) Two things to remember:  a) they won't rescind the offer because they think its rude of you to ask for more money  b) any future salary increases are likely to be calculated as a % of your current salary.  Thus where you start will greatly affect where you end up salary-wise a decade from now.  Thus always ask for a few thousand more.  The worst they can do is say no.",NA,NA,NA,"This is a question about reference Letters. If I'm not sure if one referee will give a supportive letter, how to I communicate with the person?

If you are not sure, then don't ask that person. 2) agreed. 3) When I ask I new for a letter (e.g., a new postdoc advisor that I haven't worked with for a long time) I phrase it as ""would you feel able to write a positive and strong letter for me"".  If they said no, that they could write a letter but not a strong one, than I would look for I else.  4)  I agree with #1 here.  If you have any doubt at all, then that person is not an appropriate letter writer.  This is from experience; I lost a year on the job market becaue of this exact issue.

Last year someone made another page for all the jobs that were off the market (either someone accepted the position or it was pulled for funding, etc.). Now that some of the jobs are getting filled, I would suggest that we should have another page like this to declutter the Vacancies page. Thoughts? If so, the filled/cancelled jobs should be removed from the active vacancy page. 2) Go for it :) 3) second this idea. I'd do it but don't know how to create a new page. How about we just delete those from the vacancy page? 4) Please don't just delete.  I think the information would be good to have. 4) Yes, let's do please keep the filled/cancelled jobs somewhere. 5) There is now an Accepted page, but how long should we wait to move them from the main page once there is an offer? Can it be assumed that after 30 days the offer = accepted? There are a lot of offers on the page but few seem to change. 5) I think you are observing the effect of ""We're all in this together... wait, I got a job?... so long suckas!"" Everyone on here has the same goal of never having to look at this wiki again. 6)  Moved a bunch of jobs from the vacancy page to the accepted page. If the offer was made > 1 month ago with no updates I assumed it was filled.  7) Negotiations can take a lot longer than a month, so I wouldn't move anything without first-hand knowledge. 8) #7 is correct, particularly if the offer went to someone with multiple interviews or a spousal hire negotiation. #6, please move the jobs back to the vacancy page.","Phone interviews are the worst!!

Sincere apology to other interviewees in the same search and I will surely be more considerate (and vent less) in the future! 2) It happens to the best of us.

Has anyone ever gotten a rejection e-mail after that stage? 1) I have, and it's not uncommon 2) I've only gotten rejections by email after campus visits. The one offer I got was by phone. 3) I think the rejection e-mail and phone call offer are pretty standard x2 4) or the rejection by ghosting after campus interview (it's real) 5) It's very real... like how hard would it be to shoot TWO-THREE PEOPLE an email, ugh. 6) I've had a department chair tell me she wishes she could email those people but she's not allowed, and that she can communicate only if you contact her so she wished people would do that.  so sometimes not their fault? 7) Then the dept. chair should be upfront with the candidates as they leave and say ""Unfortunately our HR rules stipulate...yada yada"" instead of warming lying through their teeth and saying they'll be in touch within the next week or 2 * I've been in a dept. where the dept. chair has to call the candidates that also didn't get the offer. It sounds miserable for both parties. I couldn't imagine being a candidate and being excited from the caller id....and its a rejection! 8) in regard to #6, I can't imagine that there are actually HR rules which prevent a search committee (or some designee) from contacting the interviewed candidates who were not hired at the end of the search process; those that I am familiar with designate who that person should be (usually the search sommittee chair). 9) My university HR does not permit contact with on-campus candidates after they leave. Any emails are not to be replied to and phone calls should be directed to the dept. chair. However, HR doesn't really police this strict policy. 6again) 8, I don't know what to tell you besides that I've been told this by a department chair who asked me to contact her because she didn't want to be a jerk who didn't send an update. University HR rules are weird sometimes. And 7, that sucks and is super rude that someone said they would contact you and didn't. 10) I got an offer email 11) OP--I've only been rejected with a phone call; but I was told I would be called either way to be informed. 12) similar to a couple others, at my R1, HR's rules are to not contact candidates until search is completely concluded, which can take months after the offer is made. It's ghosting-by-HR's-rules. If someone cold-called me I could tell them things about it that I couldn't in an email, because phone calls don't leave a trace and can be denied retrospectively. 13) I have a phone call scheduled about 1 month after an on-campus interview. All they said was they wanted to fill me in on where they are in the process - not entirely sure what that means... ","What would be the reason that the very particular long post discussing a potential lawsuit for racial discrimination gets deleted over, and over (I think 3 times so far)? 2) It's been more than three times at this point. I have two theories: 1, the thread is really long so you have to double click and scroll and maybe select portions of the section that you're reading to follow each line and people may press enter and delete it accidentally; 2, people keep deleting it on purpose because they don't like/want those types of discussions around here. 3) Theory # 2 seems right. Is it possible that some racist faculties are worried that their BS is gonna be exposed, and that's why they kept deleting that thread? 4) post is basically 2 crazy people arguing with each other about nothing, why does it matter? x2 5) I think accidental deletions do happen sometimes here. I've seen totally innocuous / inconsequential threads deleted. It's easy to do. 6) I think #4 is providing evidence to support theory #2 lol  7) Disagree with # 4. I don't think it was only ""2 crazy people"" involved. And it matters because nobody gets to delete somebody's post just because they don't like it. Only OP can do it. 8) Anyone can delete anything 9) Anyone ""can"", but anyone ""should not"". There is a difference. Anyone can murder innocent people, but they should not. Learn the difference. If I wanna delete all the posts under each tab, will that be acceptable to you, or, others? 10) Deleting a post just because you can is wrong. It's petty and sad. x2 11) Making conclusions without any evidence is also wrong. 12) To #11: Who made ""conclusions without any evidence""??!! I did NOT see any. I thought that the post was all about a potential lawsuit for racial discrimination. What is that have to do with ""conclusions without any evidence""? 13) #4, 8, 11: You are conspiracy theorists. 14) I want to confess that I think I deleted it once on accident due to it being extremely difficult to navigate on my tablet. I stopped using my tablet to look to access the wiki. So chalk one deletion up to theory number 1. 15) #11 here. I was referrring to concluding people were deleting it on purpose in response to #10. The opposite of a conspiracy theory. People make mistakes and there's no evidence that people are willfully deleting it. 16) I am going to spit my coffee out laughing when I come back tomorrow and this thread is deleted. 17) How about we preserve that post on its own secure tab? AP x2 17) Put it on a secure server x2 18) Yeah, we need that post back, and need to make sure none can delete that again. 19) Yes! It is crucial that it be preserved to let future generations know how horrible an invention internet anonymity was. 20) I think the original post, and this one, contain abusive comments towards others and should be deleted. 21) @20 can you point exactly which comments here are offensive? and why it should be deleted? The ""crazy people"" is the one I found to be most offensive, barely, and don't think it should be deleted. Deleting things is not a proper way to deal with complicated topics and abusive people. Visibility helps more the cause. x2 22) I agree with #21. I don't really see any abusive comments in either threads. Also don't forget this is ""venting"" tab. That thread should not have been deleted in the first place. Personal dislikes should not be the cause of deletion of a thread.23) Does no one here know that anyone can see the version history on google documents? Just go to File -> Versioning. I restored the top post on General Discussion that was deleted earlier (I am not the owner of this document fyi). I actually have my students use google for this reason because they can show me really quickly if someone hasn't been contributing. 23) Thank you for the tab ""venting hall of fame"" !!!  x2 24) LOL. This should be a continuous tab in all subsequent job boards. There are some crazy ones from years back (e.g., ""I slept with the search chair"") that should also be added! 25) @24, wait what?!? An ""I slept with the search chair"" thread? 26) Yeah, I'm gonna need a link to follow that story down the rabbit hole. x3 27) Just poke around the old wikis linked on the ""Links"" tab... 28) Someone repeatedly (like, at least 6 or 7 times) deleted a post about sexism a month or two ago. It was clearly not an accident. 28) @27 I think it was the same post OP is talking about. It started with racial discrimination and evolved into sexism, complexity of intersectionality, yes? If it's a different one I totally missed. 30) Yes, it's that racial discrimination + Sexism post, that someone deliberately has been deleting. That post is now added here as a secured tab ""Venting Hall of Fame"". That is awesome. But, in my opinion it's still good to have the post back here as well with a note that ""it should not be deleted"". 31) There was actually another post (in addition to the one about racial discrimination) that was repeatedly deleted as well - it was up for a shorter period of time, focused on sexism and misogyny. 32) omg, this is a post about a post. give me a break X3 33) That's not just ""a post"", but a post that had to be secured under a separate tab (Venting Hall of Fame). Ofcourse people have intense interest about it. 34) Further, it's about the bad behavior - and targeted bad behavior - of members of this community. There's been a bigger problem with it this year than in previous years, and it's ... concerning, to say the least. x2",Horizontal move of Assistant professors ,"Is it just me or are there fewer jobs this year? Hopefully, the push in November has more ecology.. 2) I definitely have fewer on my own list of possible places to apply than I've had in the last 2 years. 3) There was been very few ecology positions I'm interested in this year. Too many lecturer/teaching-track/temp positions. :( 4) It's the way of the beast...eco/evo doesn't bring in near the amount of money as cell/molec research. Creating specific degree tracks for advertising purposes has revealed to administrators that the majority of students are pre-med/cell/molec driven. Departments are transitioning.","#SpiderGate Holy Crap, what do you do if all your papers are compromised because of a collaborator...... 2) Hope that you are one of the people who already secured a TT job before the papers were retracted. What a terrible situation for everyone, but especially for the students and postdocs who haven't gotten positions yet and have data/papers still in the pipeline or taken away. 3) Apparently, you blame everyone else. 4) Who would have a paper in the pipeline with data collected in 2012? 5) Considering how many papers used the same dataset over and over again - probably a lot of people 6) Prepare for an avalanche.... 7) @4, people with tough field work, people with life events, people who reuse datasets... I don't think thats a fair assumption 8) @3, why do you think the data would have been collected in 2012? It seems that a huge number of published papers are implicated and presumably (given the labs publication rate) a huge number more are in the pipeline. Many of those are likely the projects of his current students and postdocs or recent students. 9) Don't understand your question 10) Behavioral ecology is being rocked by a giant data manipulation scandal that seems to be largely related to one person but is having huge impacts on many many coauthors including current and former grad students and postdocs who were unaware of the data problems but will have to deal with the association and loss of papers/datasets/in-progress analyses as they try to apply for jobs. 11) Mark my words, this is going to get bigger. There were definitely others involved who either helped fabricate data or looked the other way. 12) The datasets are so small too. Its not big data. Its not even medium data. Its tiny data. It seems like someone analyzing the data didn't look at it at all. The other things that are coming out are surprising too. Observers were watching 40 spiders and coding responses simultaneously? The saddest part has to be the motives of some of the people trying to jump in and check the data of all the papers. I'm not talking about the authors, editors, or concerned scientists in the field. I am saying there are hard Shaudenfreuders waiting with fangs out and tails up. Downloading data from dryad and salivating over what they can find and report on. You can see the status of papers at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11YnXhBNCNAv9aoE6tdfUqHBdo6YjaODWAh4k4-O1nDM/edit#gid=0 13) I would like to say to these people that it sucks right now but you will get through it. Whatever happens and no matter what is said to or about you: you are worth much more than your work and your pubs and twitter comments. Hang in there! You will get through this and if you need help, please seek it. x2 14) I am one of those affected by this, and can confirm it's a brutal experience. 15) Holy crap indeed. For those of us not part of the Twittersphere, when did this surface? 16) Here is a narrative: http://ecoevoevoeco.blogspot.com/?m=1 17) Thanks @16 18) Damn @1 and everyone, sorry! Good vibes +1 to @13's comment. And for those who haven't looked at the scale of this -- the person at center of it has ~150 papers, <10 years into TT 19)  I am not a co-author but I overlapped with this guy as a trainee and he's also an extremely efficient writer and clear thinking in this subfield; he'd probably be a dream to collaborate with.  22) To the search committees out there and grant reviwers: I think we all have an obligation to support the collabs and bystanders.   No one should have their career wrecked because of someone else's lies. 23) Really messed up. How many ppl have been led on and dissertations/papers/grants motivated by these bogus results?! 24) I'm waiting to hear what the motivation to fabricate data was. Was the PI that stressed?  25) Based on google sheet mentioned above, glad to see his students' own collected data and resulting papers weren't flagged (thus far), just ones were he collected (or created) data...  26) @24, ppl noted that even his PhD data is suspect, so fabrication may have started right off the bat. Motivation for doing this kind of stuff is surely prestige. More papers, grants, invited talks, fancy job offers = huge ego boost. 27) @26 wow that's so tragic in so many levels  28) As a collective can we all agree it's not necessary to continue saying how ""brave"" and ""graceful"" this was handled by the co-authors? Maybe you think so but surely not every twitter post has to begin this way 29) I agree the praise is kind of extreme. It seems that all the co-authors and others involved have handled it all very well, but what else could they do but be transparent? It doesn't seem as much bravery as the obvious thing that they have had to do given the bad situation. I also really wonder how these things get evaluated. Quite a few people---through no fault of their own!---have gotten lots of high profile papers that boosted their careers but were based on manipulated data. Of course they would have been working on other interesting science if they hadn't been tricked, but everyone knows that writing up straightforward, clean results is much faster and easier than writing up real data. 30)@29 Or easier to write the story(ies) first, and then just insert an excel equation into the data file to add an addition ""2"" to certain treatments to support the story (ies). The working Google document highlights that the level of fraud this guy has committed is criminal, an now a lot of busy people are working hard to clean his mess up.    31) I agree with 28 and 29. At the end of the day, anomolies in raw excel sheets were not caught by the lead authors who both analyzed the data and got multiple papers out of these collaborations. These papers led to jobs, awards, grants, etc. It was an outsider, investigating the raw dryad data carefully, that finally caught it all. So although it is certainly a terrible situation for all involved, the 'hero' claims are a little too much I would say  32) Sympathies also for the people that didn't get jobs and grants because of this fraud. x3 33) I agree that I hope most people would respond so transparently if put in the same situation, but to be fair - this wasn't discovered by some random person just trolling through raw data on Dryad, they had ""inside information"" that suggested something was up and so looked at these papers in particular. Dan Bolnick explicitly said that the patterns are subtle and hard to detect *if* you don't know tAlways wondered how this guy managed to publish so much. 20) To those affected, you are amazing and handling this with incredible grace, I think the community is clearly rallying behind you! x2 21) @ 18: please note that many of his many papers appear to have no issues at this time and it's not really productive to imply they do. See Bolnick's twitter for link to a spreadsheet tracking paper status. @ 19:o look for something. 34) Yes, I think its fair to give a lot of praise to the whistle blower who apparently was a grad student/postdoc and so faces a real career risk by raising the issue. Lots of the people who will have the most retractions are already in TT jobs that were won, in part, based on these papers. Of course what they are going through now is really miserable, but they will not lose their jobs over it. People who collected their own data that didn't tell clean stories and so didn't publish high profile papers never got those jobs in the first place. One thing that is so odd about the whole situation is the number of these papers where Pruitt apparently collected the whole data set that told a perfectly clean story but then handed it off to other people to be the first author. That alone seems very unusual and was a real advantage for people who didn't have to deal with all the time invested in data collection for these projects. Some of the twitter discussion--including from prominent scientists--has suggested that co-authors involved be given 'special consideration' by search committees, tenure committees, and granting agencies. I have a lot of sympathy for them, but that seems much too far. 35) @34 I would hope they were meaning that co-authors should not be punished, rather than, they should get special preference. Also agree with 31 - certainly not trying to place fault on anyone but JP, but these are small data sets that just seemed to blindly be imported into R. Every R course from here on out should emphasize that robust data analysis goes far beyond just learning to code... 36) @34 - Just fyi, the cases of fraud are highly varied.  Some are people who just got sent datasets that appear manipulated/fabricated.  s where I collected lots of real data and he messed with them at some point. @31 - Honestly, lots of these are things that you wouldn’t spot unless you know what to look for.  You’ll seem more as papers are officially retracted and details are released.  But we’re talking about various types of reshuffling and reshaping of data that makes it not easy to spot.  And also things that are not picked up in summary statistics.  It took Kate L months to figure out what he did, but after that things blew up as we knew what to look for.   Sure, there are cases where people should have spotted something funny, but I don’t think that’s majority.   Most of us were junior to him and trusted the data as it passes the typical checks. 37)  Dear Journal Editors: you should be hiring a real forensic data scientist and not relying on self-proclaimed ""reasonably good statisticians"" to find anomalies in the dataset. I have found two datasets with instances of questionable repeating sequences and non-Benford digit distributions in two datasets that were ""cleared"" by one of these people tasked with overseeing it. It is time to bring in scientists with expertise in this area and leave it to professionals. No offense at all to the people checking data, but if you want to do a thing...do it well. 38) Hiring a outside forensic firm implies you want to get to the bottom of the fraud. That doesn't seem to be the case here. Editors have other editors and coauthors investigThose are common across the field but no individual necessarily had a ton of those.  I’m a case where my work was independent as a collaborator that incorporated Jonathan into my work at times.  I did independent work for multiple months on some projects and then had Jonathan help for a week or provide an additional bit of data… in these cases his bad data (of varying types) tainted a lot of my real data.  He’s even manipulated some of his student’s real data.  Just pointing out that there are various ways and to varying degrees lots of us have gotten screwed.  Four of my retractions will be on projectating. They just want to protect themselves and have it go away with one clean fall guy. 39) @37 Yeah, I'm seeing a lot of papers being 'cleared' by co-authors without posting the data that were collected by Pruitt. Every paper needs a third-party arbiter IMO. 39) totally agree with other recent comments, I think any co-authored paper should be viewed as non-valid until either legit chain of custody work or forensic analysis. But more broadly, has there been any systematic study of the replicability of studies in behavioral ecology? 40) Hey everyone – we all totally agree with the parts about needing some more rigorous form of validation.  There are so many different conversations happening between journal editors, PI’s, students, etc.  It’s already been brought up that we’re not OK with an author saying ‘we checked it and it’s fine,’ and are working towards a system to validate these datasets and provide more accurate wording as to where they are in the validation process (the current wording is too optimistic and assertive).  Datasets will work their way online soon.  This is a mess that has been thrust upon a ton of us and we’re all scrambling to make this process as transparent as possible.  A lot of these are going to be retracted based on the evidence we’ve found, so the focus at this point is getting that done vs. getting the data online (as we know it’s going to be pulled). Lots of us have changed positions and don’t have money for Dryad (although github will work). Furthermore, for questionable papers that are not clear cut we have multiple data forensics people working with us and they’re helping as needed. They're all working on a volunteer basis as well.   I agree that this should be done independent of us, but hey, that’s not going to happen anytime soon.  So for now we have to take what we got as we’re figuring this out on the fly.  I should mention that Jonathan collected just a small part of my most cited paper.  I didn’t see anything right off the bat, but I gave it to the forensics people because it’s not my expertise.  They did find something and I will be bringing it to the editors.  Yes, it’s one out of many, but we’re all doing everything possible to right this.  Not a single person I’ve met who is involved is doing any less than 100% to find an expunge the bad data and results. We just have to prioritize and have limited resources.  And we’re exhausted.   So. So. Exhausted.  41) wow - just discovered this and I am angry. I applied to the first faculty job he applied to and I made the short list, but not the interview. Yes, this stuff impacts people beyond those with whom he collaborated. https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/01/spider-biologist-denies-suspicions-widespread-data-fraud-his-animal-personality 42) @37 and 39, there are currently 2 papers on pubpeer that were listed as ""cleared"" by the authors, and another one that had huge blocks of duplicated data listed as having ""only a few"" duplicates before the pubpeer post 43) @42 The spreadsheet is always being updated and is not always correct.  Lots of people were editing at the same time at first and so there were issues with blocks being overwritten or cells shifted.  Also, many of us took quick looks at things just to get an idea where things stood and how to prioritize.  We’re now coming back around and digging into the trickier ones with the help of the data forensics people that have volunteered.  Some of these are old papers too so people need to go through old emails and notes to figure out who did what.  I have had to update the spreadsheet several times to change the status of papers (unfortunately to thinking they might be fine to ultimately writing a retraction letter).  So, 2hile everyone appreciates discrepancies being brought up, please don’t assume that it’s because coauthors are trying to preserve or hide bad data.  Again, this is new territory for the entire field and we’re trying to take care of it as quickly and openly as possible, but there are lots and lots of moving parts. 44) I appreciate all of the work co-authors are doing to manage this issue. I just want to note that there are a few 2019 Pruitt papers on BioARxiv that do not appear on the spreadsheet. Since these pre-prints have DIOs and can be cited, I think they should also be investigated. 45) Given his yearly productivity there must be another 20+ papers in review or that were near submission. What a disaster. 46) @45 ""productivity"" 47) impeach the potato  AP) @47 say what now?! 48) Depose the fraud 49) Holy crap, I'm just reading this now. Honestly, as soon as I started reading this thread and someone mentioned behavioral ecology I knew exactly who this was. I only met him once many years ago, but it just never made any sense how he published so much and so early on in his career. It's despicable that things are so hard as is for us, and then there are people like this making it even harder. 50) Time to start clawing back grant $$$$$ 51) @50 (or anyone) is that actually possible? I was wondering about that. He has had at least two full NSF grants, a current NIH grant (I think maybe not yet started), and 7 years @ 350k/year from Canada 150 funding (though only a couple years into that). But of course most of that money is already spent and some involved other people (co-PIs?) too. Are there actually any legal mechanisms that they could force him to repay some (all?) of that? He might have spent >2 million in research money. Presumably they can't get all of that back...or he would have to declare bankruptcy to get out from it. Of course that doesn't even count salary over all those years or startup from three different jobs... I assume they'll get back any of the grant money that is still unspent. 52) I'm not a lawyer obviously but I highly doubt he would have to pay back grant money. If anything, the schools the grants went to might, but even that I doubt. He will of course be fired but I doubt will face any other legal problems. 51) @52, that is what I assumed, but I've heard multiple people now (who are current profs, not that it necessarily means they know anything) suggest that granting agencies (particularly NIH) could or will try to recoup money. It seems like it wouldn't be possible once the money is spent. 52) @51, I don't doubt that the granting agencies will try to recoup money, but I imagine that would all be through the universities. I don't think they would personally be suing Pruitt. 53) I don't know about Canada, but multiple American universities have been successfully sued for the return of grant money. A famous example: https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/11/duke-university-settle-case-alleging-researchers-used-fraudulent-data-win-millions. It turns out fraud in research science is more common than you may think. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2685008/.  51) Wow that is a crazy story and the idea that the whistleblower could get a payback from the amount recouped is really wild! I guess that is one way to make it worth people's time to actually check over data carefully. The case seems pretty different though since it sounds like multiple people including some admin knew that fake data was being used to win a grant. In the Pruitt case I was really thinking about misapropriation of funds after a grant was awarded (i.e. faking data instead of actually doint what you proposed), but I guess that he probably also included fake preliminary data in the proposals and that helped to win them in the first place. 54) I'm still waiting for his 2019 BioRxiv papers to be listed on the spreadsheet. These can all receive citations: https://www.biorxiv.org/search/jonathan%252Bpruitt 55) @54 – I saw that earlier.  The person managing the spreadsheet probably doesn’t come on here.  They are doing that on a volunteer basis and are obviously busy with tons of other things.  Everyone was sort of responsible for their own papers and updating them as well.  Furthermore, Jonathan now has attorneys and they’ve been sending out letters to the various journals and people involved.  They directly talked about the spreadsheet, twitter, and other methods of organization/investigation and the mob mentality (my words) that has resulted.  Nobody thinks it holds any legal weight, but it’s been effective in quieting down the public side of this all.  So again, everyone is trying to do their best here, and any lack of updates on the spreadsheets/retractions/data is because there are many moving parts, and even more now that lawyers are involved. 56) I imagine at the end of the day, the internal investigation by McMaster is the only thing that will actually matter legally  57) Oh lawyers, now the gaslighting can take a formal and threatening tone"
"Is it any wonder? Wow, after reading many of the posts below, it's not that surprising that many of us are not having much luck on the market. The interesting new twist seems to be that the SC's are at fault somehow when we are not chosen. The ""us""  verses ""them"" mentality and self pity seems odd when we are all trying our damndest to become one of ""them"" in the end. I hope that SC's don't lurk here, there's a very bad light 1) It makes me wonder if things will change when it's us on the SC. Somehow I doubt it. Sure, at first we'll be outnumbered, and our calls for change will fall on deaf ears (that's the excuse, anyway), but as the old guys retire, will we bother to change or will we have gotten used to the status quo? Or worse, will we call for change in the first place? If we went through it, shouldn't everyone? It's easy to blame the SC for rejecting you, but here's a thought. Maybe you did something wrong, or maybe you're perfect, but someone is a hair better. (2) I don't blame SCs or myself for my frustration. As James Carville said, ""It's the economy, stupid."" (3) I stand corrected...there is a legitimate 3rd party that is deserving of some of the blame. (4) I don't blame the SC. SC responsibilities got a lot harder in this economy as well. They need to secure the funding for the needed position, manage an even larger search than in past years, and try their best to find a good fit in a person who has the intentions of accepting the job and committing to the department long-term. I know of more than a few places where if the number one choice turns down the job, the funding line is passed on to a new department, and if the new hire leaves within a year or two, the funding line is transferred to a new department. I do think there is a lot of blame going on here. The truth is, its a tough market b/c there are fewer jobs and a lot of well qualified applicants. Its not worth your time or energy trying to blame someone. (5) Well put #4, all of us feel A LOT of pressure to try and make the cut and I think it's showing far too much on this wiki. The competition is FIERCE and we seem to be turning on each other as a result. Can't we all just get along? Evaluate your weaknesses, do your best to strengthen them, and keep plugging. That's all we can do.","UNC Chapel Hill Ecology Assoc Prof Anyone heard anything? They announced months ago, with an ambiguous ""until filled"" timeline. 1) I know someone who emailed to ask what was up. They just received a slightly confusing email that seemed to suggest the SC had formed a short list and that emails to the non-short listers would be coming soon.",NA,NA,NA,"How do I handle lack of productivity due to family leave? I had a baby after a 3 year postdoc. I couldn't start another postdoc with a newborn, so stayed home for 6 months and taught as an adjunct for 5 months. There's a gap in pubs in my cv that wouldn't be there if I'd been working. I am since back in a new postdoc and publishing, but there's still that gap. This doesn't only apply to women / babies - there are many reasons people might have to take a sub-optimal job and have limited productivity for a period of time. 1) I have a friend who actually lists something along the lines of ""Family leave"" on her CV.  I'm not sure where, if it is in with the Professional Appointments timeline or in the publications, but it is there.  I believe her thought is that instead of having look like there is simply a ""gap"" in productivity, she wanted to be pro-active and say ""hey, look there is a gap here for a reason, I had a child, but now I'm back in the game."" Good luck in any event.  2) there is nothing wrong with having a gap, so long as you can explain it.  you will be ok! :) 3) I'm not sure there's much you can do about gaps except to suck it up and try to make the best of it. I've had a three-year employment gap due to the crappy market and various other reasons. I tried my best to hang in there, never stopped applying for academic jobs, and continued to publish my data with my former advisor. I finally got another postdoc offer recently and am trying to get back on my feet in academia. I think I'll tell people that I've treid my best to remain productive during my gap years. As evidence are my pubs, including in some good journals (Ecology), while not having any affiliation or access to most resources.  In terms of a leave/ gap related to amily, sickness, or the even the market, don't dwell on it in your applications.  You can mention it, but take a positive spin, I.e., despite x situation, I remained productive as exemplified by... and emphasize what you currently have going on, promising research, papers submitted etc.  Search committees are people too :). Also, I would suggest if you are faced with the prospect of a leave, try to get an adjunct appointment at a university. Not a teaching one, just a an affiliation. Maybe at your PhD university, where your adviser can support your nomination and people know you, or at a research center or natural history museum as a research associate etc.  That is often not that difficult, and it can give you access to resources (library, even lab space), an address, and so on. Just a thought. Even though I am a tenured assoc prof, I am adjunct at another university and a research associate at yet another one.  ","Just sitting here, writing a grant to support me for another year as a postdoc (since a TT position is looking very unlikely this year), looking at the photo of my family I have on my desk, wishing I had the balls to give up on academia and just start cooking meth. 2) Hang in there. The meth will always be there should you decide to give it a go!","Map I had postdoc funding straight out of my PhD. Then 2 years later I got a competitive 3-year postdoc.  I'm in the last year of that fellowship and I'm starting to get nibbles from R1 schools, but it doesn't look like the TT job is going to happen this year.  My advisors love my productivity and they will likely find ways to fund me for multiple additional years.  But I'm concerned my window could be closing.  Is there a general rule of thumb for when you've been a postdoc too long and it turns into a red flag for search committees even if you have been constantly productive with grants and pubs? 2) I have been on multiple search committees, and the really good folks have been post-doc'ing for 5 or 6 years. I would say people with only 3 years post-doc experience just aren't competitive yet for a lot of jobs. I would say the sweet spot is 5-7 years post-doc'ing to get a really good job. 9 or 10 years is red flag. Yes I know this sucks, e.g., how can we be expected to put our lives on hold for so long?, etc. But that's the reality. Our profession is not exactly family-friendly.  3) Family friendly?  I am starting to think that unless you are dishonest and an a-hole you will not make it. 4) I did a 1 year post doc, had multiple interviews and offers soon after. I don't think the amount of time as a post doc matters, it's your productivity as a post doc. Having now served on some searches, I know that there can be a bias against post docs who have too much experience (>3-4 years) especially if you have little to show for it. The point is to get pubs and maybe some grants applications out while a post doc to show you can do it on your own. 5) OP again, It only took 2 responses to know that this is one more thing I chalk up to luck of the draw with the search committee. I'll just keep pounding out the papers, stacking up the grants, networking like crazy, and applying for everything until I hit the seach committee jackpot. 6) #2 here. Granted there are Doogie Howsers out there, but I stand by my claim that 5-7 years of post-doc (assuming you're productive during that time) is the sweet spot. That amount of time is needed to amass the body count of publications and sky-high google scholar profile that search committees (at least at big places) want to see now. 7) I've seen some seminar candidate lists for big R1s here where no candidate is more than 3 years post-PhD; a decent number are within a year of receiving PhD. Going too long in a post-doc might hurt, and there are simply a lot of productive PhDs emerging. If you want an R1 spot, OP, there's no reason not to keep applying like it's your job. 8) Just for some insight. I have set on numerous searches at M/L schools and the years at a post-doc are typically between zero and three (one to two being the most common) for campus interviewees. ",Is the tomato job still open?,NA,"Secod year on the market. I feel like if I don't even get a phone interview this time, there's just no hope : (  2) Fourth year on the market...have had five phone/Skype interviews but no campus visits. I guess I've made progress in advancing in more searches, but it is so hard to just keep sending apps and not get feedback on what happened or why. 3) Don't be discouraged. The fact that you get phone/Skype interviews means that your applications materials are good and your reference letters are good too, that's why you are on the shortlist and have gotten phone/skype interviews. Reason why no campus visits can be many factors, such as departmental priorities, other candidates or other factors that can't be explained. Chin up. You are among the top few applicants for at least five searches. 4) It's getting depressing to watch job after job on my list listed as ""interviews scheduled."" Hopefully I will get an interview at some point? 5) #4 I have been through that many times. Trust me, I know how that feels, especially for the dream job you always wanted  6)  LOL!  I've been looking for a new gig for at least 5 years now.","Success Predictors Just for 'fun' I downloaded the Anon Quals page to see if any of the columns of info predicted job market success so far this year. I looked at skype interviews, campus interviews, and offers as response variables and all of the other columns that seemed reasonable as predictors (e.g., pubs, grants, classes, years since phd, gender, etc). Surprisingly (to me anyway) the only predictor for all three of those response variables is the number of applications submitted (I assumed that blank cells for interview/offer columns were zeros). I know that the anon quals page is imperfect and also leaves out a lot of important information like journal quality, etc, but I still expected that there would be some signal with things like total number of publications and major grants. 2) Interesting, thanks for taking the time to do that! I wonder, did you try to take into account what sort of positions people were applying for? May not be straightforward with the available data, but seems like that could affect things. 3) OP. No I didn't try to account for anything like that though I totally agree that it is likely to be important. I'm not sure you could really account for that using the anon quals page since so many people have a mix of types of positions they are applying for.  4) I filled out the annon quals page a few months ago, but haven't updated that with interviews or anything. Might be the case for other folks.  Did you try scaling any of the predictors, like # pubs per year since phd?  Anyways, cool idea and interesting finding! 5) You could also look back at the previous years wikis to get more data and see if trends hold up or get stronger. 6) Coincidentally, we have a Dynamic Ecology post in the queue for tomorrow reaching exactly the same conclusion. Written over the holiday but only coming out tomorrow. As an aside, I personally am not at all surprised at the results, but I suspect some job seekers will be. - Jeremy Fox 6) Thanks, Jeremy. I did the same thing last year with the Anon page data and found the same thing. 7) The post is now up: https://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2017/01/04/you-cant-tell-much-about-your-odds-of-getting-an-interview-for-a-faculty-position-from-common-quantitative-metrics/. Also, just for fun I also checked the h-indices of 83 recently-hired ecologists. They're all over the map, even among recent hires within a single department. Further evidence that how competitive any particular candidate is for any particular position has basically nothing to do with the quantitative metrics recorded on the ""anon quals"" page. 8) In fact most choices are bizarre 9) Maybe we need additional categories. Like papers in ""high impact"" publications e.g. Nature, Ecology Letters etc.. A person with 4 first author Nature papers is probably going to do better in the job market than someone with 50 papers in journal of very specialized biology and also PhD institution, postdoc institution rankings  10) People who think quality trumps quantity are wrong.  People who thing quantity makes up for quality are wrong.  You gotta have both for positions.  The scoop on SLAC's is that you need to seriously discuss with the committee chair or someone on staff what the research adn teaching expectations are.  YOu can figure this out by doing a google scholar search on the faculty too.  Now, if their productivity is low and teaching load high, having a great research background will not usually help, it will hurt.  As an applicant, you need to decide what you are OR you need to have multple applications packages.  This is what I did with NO papers in Nature or Science. and today I have a research-focused job at a land grant even though I have worked in teaching posts for years.  I have been on and off the market repeatedly.  I am not going to pretend what I have written is the ONLY way to do it, but it has been successful for many. ","Is anyone doing anything productive at work? Am I the only one stuck in stalking this spreadsheet? 2) No, this week has been shitty where I discovered I didnt short list at 4 schools and didnt get campus interviews after skype interviews at 3 other places.

While no specific names are listed, you might be able to highlight that someone at institution type X received $50K more money in startup and you feel like you should have the same.

This makes things even more complicated for postdocs on the market. 2) I haven't even been to/known of an interview where at least 1-2 of the candidates haven't already had jobs 3) Jeremy Fox from Dynamic Ecology here. #1 correctly recalls the data. Last year, just 11% of N. American TT asst. prof. hires in ecology and allied fields were moving from one TT AP position to another: https://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2018/10/04/how-were-newly-hired-n-american-tt-asst-professors-of-ecology-employed-when-they-were-hired-heres-the-data/. The data on the ""negotiations"" tab are a very small and quite possibly statistically-biased sample, so I suggest ignoring it. *No* aspect of the N. American TT ecology faculty job market as a whole changes *that* much from year to year. It's just not plausible that last year, only 11% of TT hires were already APs, but this year it's ~30%. Re: #2's remark about APs often being among the interviewed candidates: obviously, it has to be more common than that for APs to *interview* for TT positions than to be hired for them, since you can't get hired without interviewing first. But APs who interview for TT positions often aren't hired, in part because (i) they're more expensive to hire in terms of salary and (at research unis) startup, and (ii) search committees worry that APs won't accept the job offer but will instead use it for leverage to get a counter-offer from their current institution. A final, broader comment: if as a faculty job seeker you notice some anecdata, you should probably assume that those data are *not* representative of trends in the ecology faculty job market as a whole. The anecdata you notice are almost certainly unrepresentative--that's why you noticed them in the first place. I hope these data provide some useful context. For further useful context, see https://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/ecology-faculty-job-market-data/. And you're welcome to email me (jefox@ucalgary.ca), or to comment on one of my posts on this topic, if you have questions about the dataset or want to suggest other analyses you'd find helpful. 4) Why do you analyze them and provide advice based on the results if they are biased? https://www.google.com/amp/s/dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2017/01/04/you-cant-tell-much-about-your-odds-of-getting-an-interview-for-a-faculty-position-from-common-quantitative-metrics/amp/ 5) Jeremy Fox from Dynamic Ecology here. @ #4: You do know that, in my previous reply, I was referring to a very large dataset that I've compiled myself, right? Not to my analyses of the anon qual data to which you link. Those anon qual data weren't colllected by me, and aren't about how newly-hired TT ecologists were employed at the time of hiring. I confess I'm unclear why you would intermingle the two, and I certainly hope you're not just trying to sow doubt about my earlier comment by attacking my honesty or professional competence. But since you brought it up, yes, it's possible in principle that the anon qual data have sampling biases. But I have yet to hear a plausible explanation as to what those *specifically* might be, *that is consistent with the anon qual data themselves*. For instance, imagine it's actually the case that, if one had census data, one would find a strong positive correlation across faculty job candidates between the number of publications they have and the number of interviews they receive. Why would the self-reported sample of anon qual data be biased in such a way as to make that correlation vanish? For instance, why would it be the case that, the more publications you have, the more you under-report the number of interviews you've received? As a second example, imagine it would be the case in a census that there's no correlation between # of positions applied for and number of interviews received. Is there a plausible sampling bias in the self-reported anon qual data that would create a strong positive correlation? I can't think of any, which is why I thought the anon qual data were worth analyzing and posting about. But I may have overlooked something and would welcome others' specific ideas. The comments on that post also remain open if anyone would like to comment there (you can use a made-up name and email address if you want to comment anonymously over there). And I suppose if you want to insist that the anon qual data aren't a random sample and therefore shouldn't be analyzed even if we can't think of any plausible sampling biases that might dictate the results of those analyses, well, fair enough, we'll have to agree to disagree on that. 6) You called negotiations biased anecdata but then analyzed biased anon qual data. 7) Jeremy Fox here. @6: First, the negotations data quoted by #1 are a much smaller sample than the anon quals data. Second (and this is the more important point),  said it earlier but I'll repeat here: ~30% of TT asst prof ecology jobs being filled by people who already hold TT positions would be a *massive* jump from last year's 11% (and remember: last year's 11% has little sampling error or bias, because it's based on sampling a large fraction of a finite population). Such a huge jump is not impossible, of course, but it's very, very unlikely. Aggregate statistical features of the entire N. American TT ecology faculty job market just don't change *that* much from one year to the next. In contrast, I'm not aware of any good data that would contradict any of my inferences from the anon qual data. And the results of the anon qual data seem reasonable to me, though clearly YMMV vary on that. I trust this clarifies my thinking on this. Looking forward to learning from your own thinking about the data I've compiled, if you would like to share it. 8) 6 was taking about your conclusons from anon qual data. 9) Jeremy Fox here again. I think I'm just repeating myself at this point. But FWIW: I looked at the anon qual data and drew the tentative conclusions I drew in the post linked earlier in this thread because (i) they're the only data available on the questions of interest, (ii) the sample size is decent-ish, (iii) the results are not contradicted by any other data of which I'm aware, (iv) the results are broadly consistent with other lines of evidence (e.g., we know from the data I've compiled that newly-hired TT ecology faculty vary widely in how many publications they have, so it's not shocking that there's no correlation in the anon quals data between publication count, and # of interviews or # of offers), and (v) the sample could well be biased in various ways, but I have a hard time coming up with a bias *that would produce the observed data*. But I think this discussion is going in circles at this point. So if you disagree with my decision to analyze the anon qual data and draw tentative conclusions from that analysis, fair enough, we'll have to agree to disagree. I don't think there's anything else I can say about my analysis of the anon qual data that would advance the discussion, so I'm sure it's for the best if I just check out from this thread. ","That feeling when you see a job advertised this year that you interviewed for last year but didn't get.... 2) :(   3) definitely disappointing, but know that sometimes (many times?) when a job is readvertised it means the department is having an internal conflict or can't get it sh&* together. 4) I just had a campus interview.

","Postdoc Offer I am currently in a 1 year postdoc position that ends in August, 2020. I applied to a multi year postdoc position and was offered the position yesterday by the PI over the phone. He basically said he was placing a courtesy call and couldn't do this over email because he is legally required to wait for the HR to process the offer letter. He caveated his offer by saying a lot can happen between now and the HR processing the offer letter, but as far as he and the project team is concerned, I am their choice. Should I wait until I receive the offer letter to inform my current boss or should I inform him now and tell him I'm waiting for the letter? Also, is there a reason for concern that the HR would pull back on an offer that the PI has deemed good for his project or is it just standard practice so that PI doesn't have any liability? 2) They probably just didn't want to leave you hanging while HR got the paperwork together. Probably fine to tell your current boss (if they're cool). 4) If you're on good terms with your current advisor, be sure to tell them that you're still waiting for the final thing from HR; i.e., that you're at 97% but not 100%. That way it's not a surprise if you still need their help looking for another position, however unlikely it is that you don't get this one. The new PI is making sure you know that you *basically* have this job, in case you are about to commit to a different offer. I wouldn't refuse another offer until I knew I had a 100% one, though. The fact that the new PI gave you the caveat tells me the new PI knows it's not still 100%.  5) Thanks #2&4! 6) I was in a similiar situation and the official offer did come through but HR had reduced the salary. Basically the PI was unaware of a salary cap for postdocs at the college level and had advertised for a salary they ultimately could not offer. It was a bit of a shock but I still took the job (after a talk with the PI). 6) Nothing is real until it is in writing and signed. 7) Don't trust people. Treat it like everyone else in the working world does and get things in writing. Also know your worth. 8) Agree that nothing is real until it is in writing.  Until you have the official document, I would continue applying and interviewing where possible."
"interviews for women 13 male colleagues (mostly postdocs) of mine are on the job market this year. Some have been looking for a couple of years and some just started. All of them have interviewed and 5 of them have offers. I know 2 others that accepted offers last year.  11 female colleagues of mine are also on the job market. Some have been looking for a couple of years and some just started. NONE of them have received any interviews, this year nor last year. My male colleagues have stellar cv's but so do my female colleagues. I'm curious to hear from women to whether you've received invitations for campus interviews? Are male candidates really getting more interviews and offers?  I'll also add that according to some of the male candidates, some searches have invited only men. Furthermore, some have only been interviewed by only men (search committees) and have only met with male faculty members. Anyone else experience this?  1) Here we go again... (2) #1, you say ""we"", but you've contributed nothing. (3) Among the job searchers I know, it's pretty much even. (4) Male here, interviewed at two schools. The first SC was made up of all males and the other faculty were about 25% female (out of roughly 45), no female faculty signed up to meet with me during my visit. I don't know the genders of the other candidates. The second SC was also all male. I met with one female faculty member. It's a small department made up of about 20 faculty, only two female TT members. I also don't know the genders of the other candidates. Just my experience... (5) Just interviewed for a job as the only male of three candidates, search committee was two women, one man. Department was fairly male-biased, but still had a handful of women. (6) #1 here. Who said I wanted to contribute anything? This IS the venting page, isn't it? Not meant for serious stuff. (7) If you look on the anon qualifications page, you can get a bit of an idea as to gender and interview rates. (8) Female here, phone interviews with 4 schools now. All interviewers have been male. I have a campus interview scheduled next week. (9) I agree the old-boy search committee experience is still unfortunately widespread, but of my postdoc cohort, all the females have found faculty positions, none of the males, so it's hard to figure out what direction the gender-balance issue is headed. (10) Male here. FWIW, I was recently interviewed by an all-female search committee. (11) Similar to #10, I'm male and was recently interviewed by all-female SC. Further, I have had two female mentors so far in my academic career. (BTW, this is #1 and #6, in case #2 still thinks that I'm not contributing :D ) 12) 2 here, well then, here we go again... ;D

13) male here, interviewed by 2/3 female SC in a department that was 45% female with a female dept. chair. Perhaps with so many posters describing mixed results, maybe gender is becoming a bit more balanced that some people (e.g., OP) perceive? Still a ways to go in many institutions, especially R1s, but I think things have progressed better in the last 20 years than some make it out to be. 14) #1- thanks for your contribution as #11, 15) Run of the mill white male here. I'm feeling left out. If there is this discrimination out there, it certainly isn't helping me. (16) It might seem that one group is getting biased, but I cannot imagine this. Having worked in several universities I can never recall deliberately interviewing male candidates for females. On one search, we had only one female candidate apply, and she was deliberately ranked higher to eliminate bias issues. I was on the committee, and I know it happened. So, these things can go both ways. In your example did all candidates apply to the same number and kinds of positions? Are the positions each applied for extremely specific or general? there are so many different reasons that this can happen its pretty difficult to conclude much from your observation. However, I can appreciate your frustration (especially being on the job market right now!). Before I went back to school, I applied for dozens of state jobs in ecology. I never got an interview, and a large portion of these posts was filled with a female. Does that mean they were choosing women over men? No, it just means that the best candidate happened to be a woman. I think that if you take this approach to your situation you will be less frustrated and have fewer feelings of hopelessness. Bottom line, when I am on a search committee, I look at the publications and grants first, then I look at teaching experience. If you research and grants are not up to par with my liking, none of the rest matters. Most teaching colleges will go just the opposite of my approach. 
(17) Overall, I don't think that there is any real gender bias in our field. That being said, it is good to remember that the male bias of the past still haunts ecology,in that most ecologists older than 45 are male. A second important factor to remember is that there are biases in other biological fields, and in mixed Biology departments, this can translate to bias in hiring of ecologists, or to a gender bias in a Biology department.18) I would disagree to some degree, While I don't think there is overt gender bias, I strongly believe that gender bias exists due to the way SCs work. I have sat on two and in both cases the first cuts were made just as described above (purely based on number of publications). While this seems to be fair, the truth is women are slower to publish for lots of reasons, this has been shown repeatedly (and also shown, btw, that there is no difference in quality of publications). So, after this first cut, the majority of people left tend to be male. Then, in my experience, the few women who make the final list get extra consideration, but often they just aren't the best candidates and thus a man is hired. Having witnessed this more than once, I think the real way to get gender equality in hires is to start out comparing men against men and women against women in terms of publication record, choose an equal number of each for the short list and then choose the best candidate. Unfortunately, I don't see this happening any time soon. (19) At least in R1s I have seen overt (anti-female) gender bias from E&E faculty. I mean seriously egregious (and illegal. . . if I weren't a lowly postdoc...) (20) No, the best candidate should get the job; penis or vagina, it just doesn't matter. Geez. Why is this so hard to accept...? (21) Okay, what #18 just described is called sub-group norming, and it is illegal. Why would you do such a thing when #20 is right on target? If there reasons women are lagging behind men on paper, then address that on the front end (better science exposure and training for women, mentors, etc.) not post-hoc when it is unfair towards other, more qualified candidates. All it does is make us (women) look like pity cases when we get jobs, even when DO outperform other candidates and are the best fit for a job. I cannot think of a worse disservice, having people think I was *given* a job instead of earning it. (22) Right on 21. 
(23) I mostly agree with 21. But, at this point in my long rejection stride, I'd LOVE for anyone to ""give"" me a job, earned or not. I have bills to pay and a family to raise. So if I have to be the token female, so be it. Unfortunately for me and the other women who are willing to to take a job that is ""given"" to us, SC's are very obviously NOT exercising this practice. 
24) 20 is right that the best person should get the job, regardless of gender. The problem is with the way they determine who might be the best, i.e. basing it purely on number of pubs when there is clearly a difference in the rate of publication for the two genders. Is someone seriously going to argue that the flat out number of publications (or rate) is what makes a candidate the best. I would argue pretty strongly that there are a lot of other things to consider and these things are considered by SCs, but not until after that first cut is made. SCs use number of pubs to narrow the field, but this is a biased measure, so you end up with a biased sample. BTW addressing the difference is not so easy. There have been two main reasons cited, both quite difficult (or in fact impossible) to fix. First, one that might have some chance of change. There is a tendency for women to be slower to publish because they are slightly (just slightly) less confident that their conclusions are right, so they spend more time re-analyzing to make sure before sending them off. Second, they can have babies and no matter what anyone says, a baby will slow you down, even if the partner is a full 50/50 person. Using number of pubs as the initial screening tool will always favor men. Perhaps the two group review isn't the answer and it does seem like it would be illegal. It seems there needs to be another way to narrow the field, but it is tough to imagine how SCs will find another tool, especially when they are receiving hundreds of applications. (25) 24, you are right that there are many other factors to be considered, and gender is but one of them. Within the same sex, one person's pub rate could be hampered because he/she has ADD or OCD, or, one's productivity could be reduced because he visits this damn job wiki too much. So why is the gender to be singled out and not consider any of the other factors in the hiring process? 26) 24 again. When I said other factors to consider, I was referring to other factors that need to be considered in making a person the best, most qualified for that position. Since you mention why gender should be considered differently from ADD or OCD, well first there is the history of gender discrimination, then the current discrimination other posters have witnessed, finally being ADD or OCD might impact your ability to do the job due to the traits inherent in these conditions, however, being female doesn't have inherent traits that would hamper ones ability to do the work. I agree with you in regards to this damn wiki! How much time have I spent writing here that I could have used to write more papers... It's pretty clear we all need an outlet and this is cheaper than a therapist! (27) 21 again. Not to go all sociology, but many of the ""sex difference"" traits that have been mentioned are malleable and can be changed via undoing gender sterotyping at a young age (not impossible). Are we perfect at doing that yet? No. Are we improving? Yes, but it is taking time. And I totally get the baby thing, but bottom line, my (also grad student) husband endured just as much sleep deprivation and time away from work as I did, so don't leave men out of that loop either. I've been able to publish in the double digits (and so has he), all after my pregnancy. Not saying whether or not that is the norm, but I think we can safely throw that disadvantage out as being ""impossible"" to overcome and ""only"" a women's issue. (28). Hiring based entirely on the ""best qualified"" applicant only makes sense if the agreed-upon purpose of a university or college is strictly to produce the best research. But, if one purpose is to increase the exposure of students to diversity, bring in a variety of perspectives, etc. then it makes sense to base hires on a variety of factors. I'm unaware of anything anywhere that says the sole purpose of a university is to produce the best (or most) science. 

(29) WRT to 23, I think that with all the (legitimate) complaining about inside hires (which a lot of times can be spousal hires, let's admit), I think we all agree that it sucks when it isn't you, but no one is going to not take a job offered to them based upon such a negotiation. And number of publications clearly isn't what is driving a lot of hires. Many times, it is percieved potential to do good science, ""fit"" within the department (impossible to gauge), overall personality, aggresivness during the interview, heck, I even had someone give advice once for an interview at a small rather undistinguished department that I had to make sure not to seem threatening to anyone there, particularly those new faculty without tenure. Although everyone may herald your Science or Nature paper, and rightly so, but people are people and they can be threatened by success or by someone who might rock the boat. It's a tricky thing. In top departments, yes, I do believe that overall the best candidate is hired. In less than top/middling departments, sometimes mediocrity wins, or the person who managed not to piss off the most faculty wins. Another angle is that faculty are selfish: they want someone who wont directly compete with them, but can give them a new perspective and help enhance their research which lots of times becomes stale under the demands of teaching and advising students. We are getting too wrapped up in particular situations. It's a decision by committee and sometimes the Peter principle wins. Sometimes it makes sense, sometimes it is backroom old boys network, but I dare anyone to think that they are not deserving once that offer is made for whatever reason. Kinda off topic, sorry. (30) I don't know folks, but all the of departments i've applied for this year have only 1-3 females, and I simply think that is pathetic. In a department that has only 1 female, for example, I seriously think there should be a strong attempt to fill that position with a female, assuming they are also well-qualified. I realized there is a historical factor here too, but I have been disturbed by how unbalanced departments still are these days and think there is a real need to get with the 21st century and properly reflect proportion of females in the field of ecology. 
(31) A fair amount of research has shown that women are more likely to receive an interview or be invited to speak in a symposum when women are on the search committee/advisory board. (32) one point I haven't seen in this thread (apologies if I missed it).  SCs can only recommend their choice to the administration.  I was once told I was the SC's top choice, only to have the job go to another applicant - perhaps due to gender, perhaps to another factor. ","application strategy Do you apply for every job that you could possibly make a case of a fit or even apply for jobs where you don't think you'd fit but apply anyhow (shotgun approach)?  Or are you more selective and only apply for those where the job add clear indicates that you fit (more rifle-like)?  I'm interested in what others do and their logic for this very bad job market.  I mostly used the rifle approach this year (with no luck at all) where I applied to very good fits (according to what was said in the job description) or jobs that were in locations that I really wanted.   (1) Shotgun this year, but the SCs saw through it. I only had success at places I would have targeted with a rifle approach. Last year, though, I used a rifle approach with absolutely no success. Go figure. (2) I only applied for a few this year (I am funded at least until Jan) and was picky. My criteria: a) a job I really wanted (type of department, teaching load, job description, etc) b) place I wanted to live (region, size, etc), c) place where my spouse could keep job (work location is flexible within a large region), and d) research institution (with the exception of one school which was in my home state - could not resist and still bummed I did not get an interview). I worked really hard at molding each application to the job/department/university. I got bites at many places. Right now I have 1 offer - ironically for the position that was the > stretch (but I almost convinced myself in the app!). One job that I thought was a no-brainer I did not even get a request for letters. (3) Same as #1 with almost identical results except no offer yet, but last year I had had 3 campus interviews and 1 phone. So far this year I was a finalist for a position that got closed, got a phone interview at another, and I was shortlisted at 2. Still waiting...(4) Similar to 1 with a few hits from ""stretch"" schools.  As my advisor said repeatedly: ""Before you skip applying, ask yourself if you would take it if it were the only offer you got.""  For many schools in this economy, the answer was yes, so I applied to a bunch.  The offer I ended up getting was a stretch school where I didn't have experience with the class they needed taught, but everything else was a good fit, so they figured I could pick it up as I went along.  Hopefully they're right ;)  Seriously, though, if I had skipped applying because of the description, I wouldn't have a job now.  I figured that I would let the SC eliminate me rather than eliminate myself.  (5) you know, it is hard to say what works.  I've done both, but the current economic situation has not made comparison possible.  I received interviews through the shot gun approach (first coupla years), past years with focused application did nothing 6) I've been both on a SC and an interviewee. My advice: if you are interested in the job, do not eliminate yourself. Let the SC decide if you are what they are looking for or not. I got a job where the title was so far from what I do it was laughable, but turns out they didn't really know how to describe what they were actually looking for. 7) #6, this is #2 again.  I completely agree.  While I really worked on making my application about the posted job, the offer I am most serious about is the one where the title makes my friends say ""really?"".  The search committee did know what they wanted, but not nec best reflected in the title.  We will see what the actual $ offer is, but hopeful. 8)  I shotgunned and got 2 offers and made the short list at a few I thought were a real stretch - on one of those it turned out they just liked the organism I was working on.",NA,NA,NA,"Quick Question about this wiki/google docs:  I'd like to start another discussion google doc for a sub discipline, not job related.

After candidate interviews are over, how long does it usually take for a job to be offerred to a candidate?  I'm trying to decide whether there is still hope or whether it has probably been offerred to someone else. This waiting is the worst. 2) I waited ~2.5 weeks after the last interview for my offer, I think due to some of the committee traveling in the interim.  But you never know, the first offer may fall through, which will take longer.  I had a collegue get an offer almost a month later due to that scenario.  That is why the rejection takes so long some times.  Committee is keeping options open. 3) I've had three offers.  After interviews were finished, one took about a month, and the other two each took a week.  In my current department, they wrapped up interviews for a position nearly 2 months ago and they still haven't offered it due to a byzantine decision process. 4) Most departments need to convene the department faculty for a conversation/vote which often revolves around a monthly faculty meeting. Then there's the Dean approval. So, if you're the last candiate, I think timeline is often 1-5 weeks. But, if you're an earlier candidate, longer obviously. (3 again)  To add to what #4 said - I've found that small SLAC departments generally come to decisions much more quickly than larger departments, probably because it's easier to get 5 people together to vote than it is 40 people. OP) Thanks for your responses. 5) RE: people turn down jobs. This is much more likely to happen at the SLAC and MS-levels, but at R1 schools turning down a job is rare. If someone else was made the offer, go drink some brandy and then try to forget about them because it's very likely over. The odds of getting two R1 offers, assuming one was picked for interviews at two R1 schools, is about 11%, and not many people are fortunate enough to even get two R1 interviews, so it's likely the person who got the offer ahead of you will not be getting another offer that good if it's an R1. 6) This is easier said then done and I struggle with it a lot but...work your ass off for whatever stage of the application process you are at. When that stage is done, try to forget about it. Honestly that helps. I tell myself that I didn't make it but don't beat myself up about it. I still check the wiki but I do think it helps me out aside. When I started applying, I used to obssess and it was so unhealthy. Getting rejected a lot has helped!

After a phone interview I was told next steps would be calling primary recommenders (that already sent letters), sending the list to the dean, inviting folks to campus, then soliciting 3 'secondary blind recommendations'. My primary recommender (PI at an R1) has never heard of this - are they going to ask primary recommenders for more? Call co-authors or current colleagues? 2) That sounds potentially risky for the candidate I left my last postdoc because my boss turned out to be a raging narcissist. There is a reason he isn't writing letters. 3) Only heard of this in Europe. 4) I think what they mean is sending the CV/application to outside reviewers who do not personally know the candidate -- sort of like when you go up for tenure, but the 'blind' part implies that the name/gender of the applicant is removed.

Has anyone ever heard of this company or been contacted by other head hunters?

For instance, they've likely also been contacting senior people in the field, asking who they'd recommend for the position. As an aside, it's very unusual (and in my own personal view, not a good idea) for a university to use an executive search firm to aid a search for an asst. professor position.

","5-year plan I have been asked on a couple of interviews to answer some variant of the question: where do you see yourself in 5 years?  I find it difficult to answer because the future is contingent on unknown opportunities and funding availability.  How is it best to address this question?  Talk about grants that you'll apply for?  How many students you want to have?  Specific papers that you want to write or topics you want to address? 2) One variant of this that I've been asked is what I want to be known for in a few years. 3) The question is mostly pointed at what grants do you think you will submit, but also what direction do you anticipate taking your research (and collaborations you might seek). 4) They want to see the direction of your research beyond just the next project. What are the big questions you're working towards? X2  5) Agree with 4. You can acknowledge uncertainty in funding but then just describe a scenario where things work out they way you'd like. What will your record look like when you're coming up for tenure? 6) This is a BS question that encourages overhyping. I would love to know what, if any, relationship there is between how well people answer this question and how important/impactful the research they actually do over the next five years. I suspect that actually evaluating the work that people have done over the previous five years would be a much much better predictor. Agree with others in the thread though about the best way to answer it and some version of this has come up at every interview I've done so you have to be prepared for it.  5) @6 I don't think of it as only predicting success, but understanding fit with the department. People's research directions take turns, so I want to know what someone will be doing in the future, when they're going up for tenure. But also, whether they think that far ahead or not (in which case they might have been coasting on their advisors' ideas rather than having their own). 6) @5, I totally get that that is the reason for the question, I just think that it is a question that really begs for people who are good at BSing about big ideas that sound nice over people who are actually going to do good work (and of course some might do both). 7) I agree with 6. It's entirely possible to not have been coasting on someone else's ideas, and come up with original projects as questions present themselves rather than having it all planned out in advance. Many big-name PIs I've met aren't planner-aheaders, but they already have a brand, so it doesn't matter much in their case. My suspicion is that this sort of question does give an edge to people who rank higher on narcissism, which probably does relate to grant acquisition, but not necessarily good outputs. OP) Thanks everyone.  It's nice to see that my feeling about this question (that it favors those with big egos) is shared, and also get some good advice about how to approach it. 8) I actually disagree that this is a BS question or one that caters to big egos.  This is essentially asking you your research statement - what is your research plan.  What are the big questions that you have? How would you accomplish that.  I am not saying that they want to hear ""I'll have 3 NSF grants by then"" (although maybe some do), but when we ask it where I work, what we want to know is that A) you have thought about your research program beyond what you are doing right now and B) you have some idea of what you would need to get there.  Just my two cents from the interview side of it. x3 9) They've already read the research plan by that point, and probably seen the chalk talk, or are about to. 10) Not sure what % of places have chalk talks, but I don't think it's unreasonable to engage candidates in talking about what research they envision doing in the next 5 years (even if it is written down elsewhere). And frankly if someone seems unprepared for that question (one of the most common questions like what course can you (or want to) teach) I might question how seriously they are taking the interview.10) I think there is a subtle distinction to be made between asking about research plans for the next 5 years and asking the question ""where do you see yourself in 5 years"" (or 10 as I was once asked). The first is absolutely reasonable, whereas the second is a typical lame ego-driven HR nonsense question that invites boosting and boasting and general silliness. 9 again) I can see what you're saying, but I'd think the question is getting at what I said or I'd answer it that way. 10 again) yes, I would certainly approach any version of this question from the ""this is what my research program will look like during these years"""

This is also the second time I've interviewed against an inside candidate - it sucks! I know that department's have a ""process"" but when the outcome is pre-determined it's really at a huge cost to the pawns of that process.  I hope SC doing this at least feel some shame. (1) Ugh, this drives me crazy. Last year I interviewed for a job, and the other two interviewees were BOTH inside candidates. 

(2) I hear ya, but think of it like this: you made a one-time investment for clothes/shoes that you can use in future interviews. Even if you have to go through the hiring cycle next year, you can still use these. And the price you paid for them will be pittance compared to the joys of having landing that TT job! If you are getting called in for interviews, you are having more success than 90% of the job searchers right now, so more interviews are bound to happen.
(3) I agree with 2 about your success rate (although interviews are small consolation without offers). Plus, 2 guys who defended a year ahead of me in my dept got VAPs that were extended to TT after a year. Both interviewed as the ""inside candidate"" this year and were passed over for another candidate. Inside searches are frustrating, and maybe they're usually predetermined, but they aren't necessarily a waste of time (any more than any other unsuccessful interview). 4) Original poster here - thanks! You both make good points - the clothes are definitely re-usable and you never know what will happen with a search. It was just very deflating. But thanks to both for some really nice comments, the wiki is sometimes kind of mean and these make me feel like we have a pretty great set of people in field. 5) OP, did you like my drawwrring? ;) ----->
6) this is 3 again. We have enough stress without ripping each other. I don't have time to attempt to emotionally destroy each of the people on this wiki just in case you are the other campus interviewee in head-to-head competition with me. Besides, we have plenty of time to be horrible to job seachers when we are the ones on SCs [insert evil laugh here]. (7) I just interviewed for a job (3 interviewees) where I found out there is one current post-doc who is also interviewing. Interestingly - this person's post-doc adviser is on the SC. I felt the interview went really well (although I definitely am a little ""different"" compared to the department), but will let you know how it goes. Not sure how I will feel if the ""inside"" person gets the offer. 8) OP here - yeah that is one sweet drawing! How did you know I wore a cowboy hat with a large dollar sign to the interview? I felt it helped me look really classy. Next interview I'm thinking of using temporary tattooes to write ""Love"" and ""Hate"" on my knuckles - should impress 'em. Oh and #7 good luck! 9) I don't really understand what is meant by an ""inside"" search. Do you simply mean a search that is run as an ""open"" search but for which the search committee and department already have a strongly preferred candidate (be they from inside or outside the department)? I think this is sometimes done (more often at the senior level than the junior level) because the department would like a ""directed"" search, but the dean dictates that the department must run an open search. This would certainly be very frustrating - because if invited to interview you are really merely there so that the department can put on a show of running an open search. By contrast, if you mean ""inside"" in the sense of hiring a postdoc or graduate student from the department into a tenure track position - my impression is that (at R1 universities), having studied or postdoc'ed in the department is generally a disadvantage in competing for a faculty position in that department. I think that this can be true even for candidates who are offered an interview. This is for a number of reasons that perhaps participants of this board can discuss. In the end, (the above example regarding faux open senior hires excepted) my impression is that departments will generally hire the best candidate that they can for the job (with ""best,"" of course, subjectively defined; and with the search committee and department chair's decisions, admittedly, fallible; and with political factors, naturally, taken into consideration), regardless of whether or not they come from within or out. No? 10) This is #7. In my experience at three universities seeing searches run, the ""inside"" (non-senior) issue really varies. At my MS institution, if you were ""inside"" you had almost no hope - unless partner hire, which is another issue (they would do a full search, but only have the FTE if hiring the partner so really pointless). At my PhD institution, ""inside"" candidates had a >>> shot - very inbred department. There is also a track record of hiring ""internal"" candidates at my current institution (no, I am not TT) as well as an institution I interviewed at. However, there was a job I did not apply for last round because it was ""Dr. VAP's job"" (and I collaborate with Dr. VAP, so little uncomfortable if I interviewed). I am not sure Dr. VAP even got an interview - which is really unfortunate. Dr. VAP in this case is brilliant, easy to get along with, does great work, literally wrote the book on the subject and has been associated with the inst. for years. I think it was a committee backlash against the assumption that Dr. VAP would get the job. Worse, his PhD adviser was the search committee chair, retiring, and had been ""grooming"" Dr. VAP for years to move into the job. 11) I think I might know who Dr VAP is and if it is this same person, they will likely get in through another ""inside"" door...one for which I was the only other interviewee (and was told I was ""perfect, the best, a shoe-in, yadda, yadda, yadda--I still haven't heard the final word on this, but it has already been more than a month since the faculty met to vote on the SC's recommendation). If your Dr VAP is not the same as mine, then that really says something about how all this works. So much behind the scenes politics! 12) I am in a similar position to #7s ""inside"" candidate and felt at a serious disadvantage because of my inside status - it was clear that the smallish school was worried about getting ""two of the same."" 13) Argh! I just found out today that I lost out the job to an inside hire and the SC chair had the gall to tell me that, despite the fact that the other candidate had been at the institution for many years, it wasn't an inside hire and they had agonized over the decision. Not as much as I have, that is for sure! 14) OP here - well I was wrong - I got the offer where I thought it was an inside search - I guess leaping to conclusions with limited info really is a problem - oops 15) Congratulations! (16) Now that's funny! ","advice If your relationship with your current postdoc advisor is less than ideal, would you still ask him/her for LoR? I'm kinda having this conundrum right now. I suppose I can dig up some of my older letter writers, but there are 2 concerns: 1) It's been a while since I asked the older ones and they might not be as up-to-date about my work; 2) I'm worried that it might raise an alarm with the SC that I'm not using my current supervisor as reference, given that his/her name is listed on my CV/ref list. Has anyone been in a similar situation? Any thoughts? Thanks. 1) I would. It would be odd or a red flag to not have a recommendation from your current post doc advisor. Sit down with your current advisor and let her/him know what you would like emphasized in their letter. Be direct and ask her/him what their ""recommendation"" would say. The flip side to asking is that she/he may not write a favorable letter. You want to be as direct as possible with your advisor and make sure this isn't this case. If it is then get someone else but, be expected to explain why your advisor is not a reference.

2) I was in the same boat. I sat down and talked to mine and flat out asked her. But I led it off by saying something to the effect of: ""Now that I'm applying, it's hard to narrow down who will be my references (Note: she knew I had several to choose from who all spoke very highly). I know we've not seen eye to eye on some things, but do you feel you are able to write me a strong letter of reference?"" I think putting it this way, and knowing that my other references were much bigger names in the field than her, flattered her to feel included. Turns out she was great with writing a strong letter and appreciated my honesty in asking her about it. She totally understood. Results may vary. Good luck. 3) Thanks for the advice, guys. I agree that keeping it candid at this point is the way to go. And thanks for the suggestions on how to approach the issue. (4) seems like a good opportunity to have a discussion in general that might set you at ease. Not easy, but probably worth it in the long run.(5) I was in the same situation. I asked my current postdoc advisor and he said he would write a letter. I had a friend on one of the SCs and she said his letter was the best! Go figure. I thought it would be pretty piss poor. Ironically, my PhD advisor, who adores me, gave the crappiest letter.  (7)  I was in the same boat, I didn't ask my postdoc advisor for a letter  - and just accepted an offer from a great SLAC school.  It was never an issue with them, and no one ever asked me or my other letter writers why my current advisor wasn't a reference.  I had an answer ready, but I think reasonable people understand that not every situation works out.",NA,NA,NA,"I was curious if a candidate staying in a postdoc for long time is a red flag for search committees? I am finishing my 5th year. This last year was very productive. I can stay for another year. Another year will enable me to publish some nice papers and I will also be teaching my own course. I would rather take a great job this year (I do have some interviews) but am considering staying on in the postdoc if the ""great job"" isn't offerred to me.  My CV will be better next job season but not sure if the number of years in the postdoc is a red flag for search committees 1) I have been on two search committees. Six years in a post-doc is not a big deal. We are seeing a lot of that. In fact, it seems to be the new normal. 7 or 8 years, or more, however, is being treated as a red flag. Arbitrary cutoff, I know, but that's how it's working here. 2) OP here...thanks #1!! -- May I ask what type of institution you have sat on search committees (eg R1, SLAC, etc) 3) I am on a search committee too, and most of the folks on our shorts lists had 6-7 years of postdoc appointments.  I think anything 8 or more years may be a little odd.  4) how about if you took a tenure-track job and out-performed the folks with postdocs, what then? At what point does postdoc experience get trumped by experience as an independent faculty member not under the thumb of a postdoc advisor? 5) Thank you! I feel better.  6) it depends somewhat on the subdiscipline; 10 years ago I would have said 6 years is too long, but in the current market it may take that long to become competitive for the jobs you want even if you are productive through those post-doc years. Post-docs: the best of times, the worst of times...","I am rather adjuncting on an oil rig than stay another year at my institution 2) 2 weeks on 2 weeks off, good pay, live anywhere...I could do that.","Nazareth College and Negotiations It is great how most of the schools are asking for names now rather than full-flegged letters. So much better! (2) I agree, but some just automatically contact the references for a letter from the contact information supplied during application. This was the case for my most recent application. 3) The letters are totally ridic at this point. Please schools, just do the list. The letters run everyone into the ground. 4) Agree with 1-3 on this, and I have been on a SC. With the number of applicants for many of these jobs, just make the final x number get letters. The process is hard enough on applicants and the practice of letters for all strikes me as laziness on the part of SCs that creates much unnessary work. 5) Pay attention to these. I've had at least two that say contact info in the ad, but once you paste all the documents it asks for letters to be requested due at the same time as the application. It really leaves you scrambling and is really annoying. Put what you want in the ad! 6) @2, 3, -- SC member here: we asked for letters up front because of our tight timeline, asking for letters of just a few after close date extends the tiemline for the search, because you have to wait 2 weeks for letters. While it does make more work for someone, remember, the search isn't about you... 7) I disagree with your perspective 6. First, isn't a search about matching the candidate and the school? Should be about both. Second, surely on some of these "">300"" applicant jobs there would be a method to reduce the letter load on the other 290 souls? If time is an issue, couldn't an earlier post date alleviate the issue? 8) 7, as a SC  member for multiple searches, you are right...an earlier post date would help with the time issue. However, you have to understand, post date has little to do with the department searching for the job. Ads are not posted until they are approved by administration. At my university, if the job is to replace a retiree, the ad is not posted until the faculty member officially turns in their retirement papers. The administration then needs to approve the replacement position. Last year, we had a faculty member turn in their retirement papers at the end of the fall semester. After everything was said and done, we could not post the ad until February. This search failed, partly because of the late posting. We debated even trying a search so late in the academic year. So, yes, in a perfect world all ads would be posted earlier, but that is not always possible. Hopefully this example provides a little insight into time-tables for some searches. Not only are they not always convenient for applicants, but often they are not convenient for the departments as well. Don't even get me started on the websites for uploading documents. Our new system (government website) does not collate or form a common pdf file for any of the application material. When you click on each file, which applicants have to upload individually, the website immediately downloads the file; i.e., no online viewing. Thus, the search committee has to create a file for every individual, download all the files from every candidate into the appropriate folder, and then collate and print the files...or...construct a collated pdf of the application material for each candidate. Basically, our new ""nifty"" online application process adds hours to application review. Before this, we just had applicants email a single pdf document (1000x easier). I guess the only reason I posted this is b/c I hate to think that applicants are associating a crappy application proccess with a department. Often times, it has nothing to do with the department. 9) When the application process is clunky, while it might not be the department's fault, it still makes the school look bad. And job candidates aren't just going to have to live with the department if they take a position somewhere, but the school. And from what you describe, we wouldn't enjoy taking part in search committees either at schools with these terrible online systems. It's unfortunate and you should try to convince your higher-ups to do something better for all involved. Otherwise you look bad, no matter who is at fault. 10) 8 again, I agree completely. However, convincing Human Resources that their new ""state-of-the-art"" system is terrible and needs changed is easier said than done. I'm just saying that I wouldn't consider the application process a deal-breaker if everything else looks good. As a faculty member, you spend very little time dealing with this crap. 10) In response to 6: I call a bit of BS on the ""timetable"" arguement for requesting letters upfront. If you narrow the long-shortlist to 15 people, send out letter requests stating that these candidates are potentially on a shortlist, most letter writers are going to be able to get letters back to you pretty quickly (i.e. sweet, my awesome former grad student may get an interview at X University, let me get a letter off to them soon). I doubt this practice really saves more than 1 week anyway. On the other hand, requesting letters upfront is a fucking slog/irritation for everyone involved, and does more to piss off candidates and their letter writers then just about anything else. The practice of requesting letters at the initiation of the search is not appropriate and needs to stop ASAP. 11) My advice would be to quit worrying about what search committees are requiring and just turn in the required information. If they find it more convenient to have letters upfront, then just have your letter writers send your letters upfront. The end. 12) In reality, I am better off if they ask for letters up front. I have VERY good letters that can make a difference. 13) @10 -- 6 here again, we have a timeline, various deadlines we don't control set it, and so we decided we needed to ask for letters up front. Anyone ""disagreeing"" with me simply doesn't understand the joys of dealing with beuracracy.  Ahh, beuracracy-- even the fanciest schools have it. If it's too much trouble for you to apply to our fantastic university (no sarcasm-- it is fantastic, I love it here) because of the letters, then don't apply. We do hope we get as many good applicants as possible, and don't think that asking for letters will put off too many. Nobody we invite for an interview will be ""pissed off"", I expected ""elated"" would be a better adjective. Anyone showing hints of the attitude you project here would be written off as self-centered and unrealistic. Oh, and @7, sure, we want a good fit, but until you get an offer, it's about how you fit with us, not vice versa. Take a deep breath, remember, it's not about you... 14) Amen 13. I can't wait until some of these applicants get jobs and see the process from the other side. 15) I have watched this debate from a far and feel a need to chime in. I am also a faculty member that has been on searches before and am currently a member of an active search committee. First, I sense a little bit of condescension from some of the other folks on this thread towards applicants. It goes without saying that it’s extremely hard to be an applicant these days for some of these ultra-competitive positions. They might be great jobs at great schools, but there is also a large range in the type of applicants that use this board, so let’s cut them all a break and tone it down lest we scare even more minds away from science. I can only imagine how disheartening it is for someone to round up letter after letter for great looking jobs only to find out that >100,200,300 people just did the same thing and their odds of making a short list are “non-significant”. So, we did the list for our current search and are seeking letters from only the finalists. Granted, our search is more specific, so it’s easier to weed out the tangential fits. However, I suspect committees could do an abbreviated letter process for most searches. Finally, something that goes unsaid and uncalculated oftentimes is the time and monetary cost of letter writers for jobs their students or mentees have little chance in getting. For example, let’s assume a letter writer spends 45 min on a letter, and that 300 people apply for a job. I’ll take a stab and say an average writer makes the equivalent of $60/hr. That’s $13,500 of other institutions $, just to write letters for your own institution’s search. In this era of shrinking budgets/grant dollars etc., this has to factor in – or at least it should. At a minimum, the optics of it do not look good for the public. This isn’t inconsequential either (e.g., “oh, well professors work all the time and don’t get paid by the hour”). Some faculty consult on an hourly basis or divert time from other priority activities at their own institution. Furthermore, some letter writers are employed by federal agencies or other entities that are responsible and serious about tracking time. So, is this practice a fair usage of taxpayer dollars? All this is to say - ask for letter writers if you need to, but count me as one that would argue vociferously that it should not be the automatic default.  15) requesting letters up front does only one thing for the search committee.  It reduces the number of initial applicants to thoe who are most interested in the position.  Then, what do letters really mean anyway?  It means you could find someone willing to write you a letter. 10) Thank you #15, Very well put. 16) my experience on search committees, and I've been on many, is that they are run in one of three ways.  If HR screens them, that is the first cut whence they eliminate incomplete applications.  Then, committee chair may form the next cut in some cases (or the first cut).  This will largely weed out those that are completely outside the job description.  He/she tosses them in a pile.  THings like the job is for a vertebrate systematist and you are a systems ecologist who has never specifically worked with vertebrates or systematics.  These applications are provided to the committee, but they are largely ignored IF this step is taken.  Then, the remaining applicantions are either divided up among the committee members or each committee member reviews every application.  The scores provided are then ranked (or averaged and rankedin the latter approach).  At this point, the committee largely eliminates 50-80% of the applicants leaving them with a pool of something under 50 candidates (usually between 10-20 remaining).   This is the stage where letters should be requested because largely letters are not considered until this stage UNLESS the score card calls for it.  So, with the letters, the committee members can now establish if some questions among that group can be answered.  Maybe someone has passed through several positions or has a strange publication record, or a lull they want to discuss with a reference.  IF they can eliminate any of this pool before contacting references, they will.  At that stage they have probably knocked out another 2-3 candidates, maybe more.  Remember, as an applicant your goal isn't really to fit perfectly the position, its to avoid getting cut!  Now, they can contact references, ask them questions.  THere might be 1-2 candidates eliminated here, but ranks can also change a lot at this stage.  Depending on the time and financial budgets involved, the committee schedules phone interviews and knocks out some bottom folks, and might re-rank candidates. Then one, two or three get an interview.  Some schools rank the phone interviews and invite their top candidate.  If he/she is acceptable, they offer and if accepted they end it.  These schools usually either have money problems or are very sure of whom they are interested in (inside hires even fall here). Such a school might follow down the phone interview list for up to 5-10 candidates and then declare a failed search if none is acceptable.  Most of the people weeded out from below the phone interview list just don't fit the department's need or desires at all.  The schools that bring in 2-3 candidates largely interview them, and if neither is offered (or accepts) its a failed search.  There are plenty of variations on these themes, but when the interviews on campus occur, all faculty and even students will evaluate faculty candidates, teh committee will review the comments and forward the selection to the chair or dean.  Some schools the chair has full hiring authority, others it is the Dean.  This entire process can take a few days up to phone interviews to a few months.  It depends on the workload of the faculty and the number of applicants, and how much the faculty really care who is hired! :) 17) At my university, each committee member ranks every applicant. From that ranking, 8 to 12 are contacted for phone interviews and letters of recommendation. The committee then invites 3 to 4 candidates for campus interviews where each candidate will visit with every faculty member available, have a meeting with the graduate students, and give a research presentation to the faculty and students (both grad and undergrad). After all the campus interviews, the entire faculty provides their ranking of the campus interviewees. Highest average rank gets the offer. Second is on the line in case of a reject and so on. Before faculty rank the candidates, there is a process to eliminate candidates if the majority of the faculty do not feel they are appropriate for the position. Only the faculty deemed appropriate are ranked. Dean gets final word, but the Dean has never waivered from the faculty ranking. 18) My take. Stop asking for letters from all candidates where the pools are going to be ginormous. ie ""ecology"".",I made a ton o' spaghetti sauce over the weekend.  Is that qualification enough? ,NA,"How have 8 campus interviews already happened for people?? (According to Anon Quals) 1) well, I'm one of them and it's carryover from a search that started very late spring/early summer.  Maybe there are several like that? 2) I was just invitied to an on-campus interview at a small school that knows their best chance of getting someone great is to move as quickly as possible & make an offer before their preferred candidate gets any other interview offers. It's a good strategy on the part of the search committee, and indicates at least a semi-functional department, but it's going to put whoever gets the offer in a tough decision spot. 3) OP here: I see... wow that's early (2)... and late (1)!  Good luck on your interviews!!!! ","General Timeline I'm getting the sense that if I don't hear back from a school within three weeks of applying, then I did not make the short list. This is after 20+ applications and getting rejected mostly via wiki. Has any one noticed an average ""Haven't heard back yet"" cutoff? 2) I find the process is all over the place. I've put out about 20 since September, and SUDDENLY I've had three skype interview requests and two aditional letter requests in the last week- a lot of searches happen in pulses, over semester breaks, I think. 3) 1 again, oh, I like the idea of SCs not being able to get together until the week after finals ;D","Oh look, the same school that told me I didn't have enough pubs is sucking up to a candidate that has ONE FUCKING PAPER. And it's not a C/N/S/PNAS paper either. Fuck them. (<---search committee, not candidate) Anyone who claims the faculty search is based on merit is lying. 2) maybe they have other attributes (grants/skillset/outreach, etc) that make them a good fit; also maybe the SC lied about why you weren't a good fit 3) It could be the candidate having a manuscript in press or under review at a very nice journal and it is not listed on their CV. 4) If the number of papers is what really matters, I would have a tenured position already. nope, still a postdoc getting rejections. 5) to #4, the system is not really fair. When I was on the job market, I had big papers but I did a longer postdoc, and alot of departments were looking for ""potential"", as in baby postdocs with one or two papers but showed ""potential"". So the number of papers don't really matter. You have to show the SC that you have ""potential"". Given a choice between a mystery box and something more absolute, people tend to choose the mystery box. 6) as a 'young' person with 'potential' but fewer pubs, I agree with #5. I've done well so far as my first year on the market, getting a lot of interest so far (though we'll see what happens), even though I have fewer pubs than my counterparts. But, I'm at the front of an 'exciting' 'trendy' subfield with broad experience (grants, teaching, etc) and that seems to count for a lot. I also wonder how much departments want someone who's earlier in their career and malleable (before they have big egos that need to be catered to) 7) I'm curious how the OP knows this about the school/candidate? I want to know things! x2 8) Agree with #7, need more details. Was the OP interviewed? Short-listed? Long-listed? Not considered at all? ...and then how do you know who they are ""sucking up to"" and how are they sucking up? x2 9) Perhaps the candidate had the edge over OP by being a pleasant person. 10) Pleasant people are the worst, don't turst them! X2 11) I'm a pleasant person, and I'm with OP on this. The best predictor of what one might accomplish if they reach their potential is what they have accomplished to date. It's like the pre-professional student who is going to work hard 'once i get into med school' 12) #5. I agree with #11 but many departments would rather have a young and ""promising"" person (just 1-2 years into postdoc) than someone who is 5-6 years into their postdoc and have a C/N/S paper. 13) I get mildly annoyed at this, too, especially when people get hired with only papers where their phd advisor is a coauthor. Oh well... 14) all of the intangible ""fit"" stuff is hard to think about in a reasonable way and probably leads to a lot of bias 14) If I knew one paper could get you a job I would have applied 2nd yr of grad school. 15) If your advisor is over 50, there's a good chance he/she was hired straight out of a PhD with one (or even zero) pubs! 16) I'll keep that in mind next time I apply for a job in 1960. 17)I've seen my share of biased, unfair job searches, some affecting me and a lot affecting friends. It can feel soul-crushing when you aren't sure if you'll get a job. In the end we all got jobs we're happy with. If your CV is objectively good, keep going and try to focus on the possibilities at the next school. If this place pulled shennanigans in the interview, they almost certainly would have been worse once you arrived. Try not to be too jealous of your friends. In the end you'll be happy when you all land well. 18) OP: so, when someone eventually hires you, it won't be on merit? 19) I know people who graduated out of the country. They spend a few years as a postdoc abroad. They get a postdoc opportunity in the US, which gets extended for years. Finally, those people realize they have spent more time in the US than their own country and decide to stay here. Moral: they get to spend 10 years as a postdoctoral researcher, with a fair productivity (moving a lot is time-consuming), international contacts, they are multilingual, and still excited about their job. But, almost impossible to find any opportunity because all the positions are taken by the young ones that sometimes never left their own town, never experienced another research group that their alma mater, a few papers, a few grants. Not sure what's fair or unfair, I don't blame SCs, they hire who they think is a good fit. But, I hope there's a place for those people as well at a some point. I think American Colleges/Universiies should be a little more open-minded sometimes than being stuck with the young mallealable American guy. 20) #19: that phenomenon goes both ways, though - it is also rare for US postdocs to be hired over nationals in most other countries. Some countries (e.g., Canada) even explicitly state a preference for hiring their own citizens in the job ad. 21) here #19. That's absolutely true! I am amnog those people I was talking about and am European. It is hard in Europe to hire an American or anyone from out of Europe. I don't support it but I know it is common. Funny story, in Europe 10 years postdoc all around the world is considered AMAZING! Here a big weakness. If only I knew before.. 22) Rec letter standards in Europe vs US are pretty different too. It hurt a lot of my British friends applying to American jobs, I think unreasonably so. 23) Yes, it's unfortunate. Same situation here. European, although I did PhD and postdocs in the US. Almost 50 publications, some in top journals, more than 1 million in funding. Very little success in the US, just a few phone interviews over the last years. Lack of fit may be the problem sometimes, sure, but not always. 24) I also think many people don't really understand what SCs are going through to try to assess 'fit'. Yes, productivity matters, but that is often defined more broadly than the publish-or-parish dogma (e.g., do you produce patents, grants, curricula, software, video animations, etc), and personality is important since they're basically stuck with this person for a long time (and departmental politics can be SO bad). I think SCs often are looking at the whole package, and when we look at who got what job, we often just look at the # of pubs and call it a day 25) I think we also don't get to see what the search committees hear from advisors or who just might not be a fan of your letter writers/advisors. If one advisor pushes harder, even if yours is positive, then they might write you off. If you don't know the letter writers it can be hard sometimes to judge what is real. It's part of the reason search chairs often pick people from a lab that they know. 26)#23 I feel for you. Advice to folks here is that, just apply to positions as soon as you finish your Ph.D. 27) No. Start applying *before* you finish your PhD. I was hired tenure-track before I had even finished, and this is not uncommon if you have a good record and you apply during your PhD. (But most people don't apply during their PhD anymore because they assume they have to postdoc.) In one good example of this, Duke recently hired a really promising geneticist/anthropologist as an assistant professor before she had finished her PhD and with only four first-author pubs. (I think possibly under the condition that she complete one year of postdoc work first.) If you have a good record, apply *during* your PhD. As has been stated above, SCs are looking for potential. 28) 100% agree with #27. If you aren't shooting for the upper tier R1 institute, apply early and often. You'd be surprised at how many people are hired with no post-doctoral experience, or just a semester experience at a post-doc, at regional state schools and R2s, and even sometimes R1s. SLACs are kind of weird b/c they really want the evidence of teaching effectiveness, so you almost have to have a lecture position beforehand to score one. However, I did have one friend who scored a pretty impressive SLAC job right out of a PhD. 29) I had friends with great pubs not get hired at SLAC/teaching schools because they hadn't taught their own course. If you want those jobs, ask the dept if there is a course you can lead with your own lectures. Also recruit undergrads to do research with you. It seems essential. 30) Surprised anyone from abroad would prefer a job at ~75% of the places advertising this year, given their generally dismal locations. 31) Some places abroad have far worse funding issues and dimmer prospects. 32) to #30, a job in a dismal location is better than no job, given the market   33) what about the opposite situation - finding out an assoc. prof was interviewed for the same T-T position as you? There is no way a postdoc CV is objectively as good, feels like a losing situation despite having ""potential"".","On-campus interviews I have my first on-campus interview and wondering how you organize the future plan session. Are you talking only about long-term plans or also the ones you would start more immediately and locally? Do you say anything about how to involve students in your research, or it's a topic reserved during individual meetings with the faculty? Any suggestion about how to prepare the research presentation is very welcome. 2) yes.  A major part of the 'future plans' component of your talk (but also discussions) is to convince the faculty that you have tractable ideas that will lead to research outcomes over the next few years.  Saying you'll continue current proejcts is fine, but you should also highlight new directions.  If you can weave in some 'high risk/high reward' ideas as well, that is great, but the faculty want to know that you have a good chance of getting tenured so showing them what you'll do to meet those expectations is critical.  And definitely discuss how students will be involved - at a SLAC this is essential but it is a good idea no matter where you are interviewing. 3) It also helps to come up with some local ideas if you do field work-- it helps connect to the area and show you're thinking seriously about how your work would be suited to this new place. 4) I usually present one fully-fleshed out proposal w/ multiple aims, and then present a less-developed, but sexy longer-term research goal in a new system. Not that this strategy has paid off yet, though... 5) Take some time to describe your lab, what facilities/resources will be in it that, for example, students in other faculty labs could use. Sketch a little what equipment you'd buy with the buckets of startup.  These types of grounded details help the committee + department picture what your lab will look like.  Then, sketch what you'd like to accomplish in the first 5 years, then where you want to be 10 years out.","1) Crestfallen. 2) Not crestfallen, but a little surprised at a school where I didn't get an invite for a phone interview - nothing is assured, but *really*, School X, when I've interviewed at Schools Y & Z, *you're* not even going to give me a phone call? 3) I was surprised today since I just learned I didn't get my LOR requested in a position that was exactly my profile. Like, really? not even my LOR? not even the very first short-list? ugh, I don't get it. It is also in a ok university, nothing wow ","Offer letter timing 1) I recevied a TT job offer last week and have been negotiating with the Dean for a few days. We came to a verbal agreement on Friday, and the offer letter is now being reviewed by the Provost. Does anyone have any experience/insight on how long it takes for the official offer letter to make its way back to the candidate? Someone in my department told me it can take several weeks, and I am hesitant to celebrate too much and jinx it before signing the official documents! 2) I had an agreement with the chair, and then had the offer rejected by the Dean and the search was cancelled. Don't celebrate until everything is in writing. Don't turn anyone down. It sucked so much. I am happy for you but urge caution.  3) After my negotiations with the Dean were done, my offer went to the Provost for about a week. Then I asked some questions and signed 3 days later. If you are working with the Dean rather than the Chair, you are probably a little safer because the Dean has control of the budget. There won't be any surprises at that level. 4) @2, sorry to hear, I just had something similar happen this week. It SUCKS and no other interviews at this point. Hope you are faring better. 5) Did you get the offer letter OP? 6) OP here, yes! It is signed and working its way back to the department now. 7) That's great news OP!","Here is the thing. Sometimes you want to get the job of Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor, but you only get to be Potions Master. Later, you get the job you want, but you end up killing Dumbledore.   <----- LOVE THIS x8  OP) Always ;) ",Lecturer/Assistant professor I'm a lecturer at a UK university but looking to move (back) to the USA eventually. A UK lecturer is roughly equivalent to a US assistant professor... should I note this on my CV somehow? I know in the US lecturers can sometimes mean short-term teaching-only positions so I was thinking I might want to distinguish between the two. Does it matter? 2) I normally clarify it because as you say some people in the US may not be aware about the disctinction. 3) Seems like a good idea. 4) Wouldn't hurt
"Increase in number of viewers Cracks me up that since the Wiki has stopped revealing the ID of viewers (by giving us anon IDs) the number of viewers at any given time has increased.  Suddenly people feel better about signing in and staying signed in for longer periods of time.  Not a rant/vent...just an observation. (1) I think the visitor no. is about the same. It's just before the anonymous user ID thing, those who did not sign in with a Google acct. appeared simply as colored squares in the list. Remember those little things at the top right corner? BTW, you can still see the user name (for those who sigend in) in the ""see revision history"" list, so I wonder how anonymous this whole ordeal really is.
2) Does anyone just chat directly with each other on here? (3) Happened to me ocassionally, when I used to sign in. I tended to get pumped for information by anonymous users. It weirded me out because I didn't know who was ""listening.""

She had research talks and guest lectures listed for the year before she started her position at the school.  I realized that she was listing her job talks.  Do you guys do that?  It would have never occured to me to put them on there but maybe I should be? 1) it depends.  In some labs it is acceptable, in others it is not.  I had a distinguished Professor tell me once that a job talk is an invited presentation.  Considering his stature, I figured he was right, then later others have told me otherwise.  i don't tink this is a majro issue one way or the other though. 2) Probably not a major issue. I would guess that the 'invited talks' section of a CV is not that important for selecting a candidate. I don't list those as they are really a different event. 3) I put them in my invited talk section (x6). 4) #2 here...ok I am convinced and will add them. My postdoc advisor has those listed and I weight her judgement highly. 5) It seems odd to basically list all the places that have rejected you... 6) #5, the speaker could have rejected the school by not accepting an offer too. 7) they may have rejected you, but you were also among the top 2-3 of at times 200 applicants.  that is nothing to snuff about.

I'm so sorry 5) Shit, that really deserves the title ""Saddest of all"" 6) My heart breaks for you. Seriously. But at least you know that you can secure at TT job. That puts you way ahead of the curve compared to other people. I wish you lots of perserverance and energy to get on the horse again next year. Many of us will be with you. 7) ask them if there is any way the can delay the offer for a year, in case the $$ come avalable next year.  offer that vthey could then save the $$ on another search.  also ask if they will fill a temp in the meantime.  you might get lucky.","Negotiations 1) Caveat: I'm new here, so hopefully I didn't mess anything up while posting this. I see quite a bit of specualtion/griping/venting about internal candidates. I've always been told (by several faculty at an R1 institiution) that you have to be 'that much better' as an internal candidate; however, it seems most of the perspectives shared here about internal candidates are leanign/barrelling toward the 'huge advantage' side of the argument. I'm curious about perspecitves of other prospective/actual/past internal candidates. 2) At least in SLACs, internal candidates are enemy #1. They are some backdooring motherfuckers. And good for them. They are smart and use the system against itself. Yes, sometimes it backfires and they get lulled into a false feeling of security, but they still experience the same panic and worry that any of the other candidates do. It is not a cake walk for them and they are (usually) held to the same standards as the interviewing candidates. 3) R1 vs. teaching colleges is an important distinction there. If an internal candidate at an SLAC has shown the faculty they can teach well and get along well with everyone, why would they hire an outside candidate that they don't know as well? Too much of a risk. In contrast, R1 institutions generally care about your potential to develop an international reputation first and foremost, and whether you can teach well and interact pleasantly isn't as important. Different motivations, different outcomes.4) Department politics is the most crucial factor 5) I probably looked like an internal candidate in my current position for a TT postion filled this year, and while I like my colleagues they know I don't like the location and want to leave ASAP.  The SLAC I work for has about a 50% inside hire rate, it seems.  There's nothing wrong with taking a VAP position and being hired on.  I'd argue it's a good strategy both for SLACs and applicans.  I would have probably been more interested in the TT position at my SLAC this year if I hadn't spent time hating on the town. 6) I know at my R1 institution they would never hire an inside person, because they've already got your supervisor, what would they want you for? This year there was a job here that I liked, but there was absolutely no point in my applying. 7) I am always surprised about this worry over the inside candidate. You never know the situation unless you have word from the search committee. At the 2 R1s I have worked, I have seen internal candidates get the position even though they were not the most qualified. The seach committee liked them and wanted them. In some ways, they built the position for them. This can also happen with spousal hires if they have to advertise. I have also seen SLAC internals not get the job. It really depends. There isn't a rule that tells you that the job is going for an internal. Just apply.  8) I have always felt that people already at the school are at a disadvantage, not an advantage.  The reason is that you tend to know what is wrong with someone you know well, but there can be perceived greatness in one that is fresh.  I have a buddy who was an inside candidate for a vacancy at my doctoral school.  He did not get the job.  As it turned out, he is now chair at an R1 in a phd granting department and the other guy made tenure and has been adequate.  Not a rip on the outside candidate, just I have always thought the outside guy got the benefit of the doubt.  9) I had a great interview at a SLAC (tons of positive feedback during the interview and after), and they offered it to the VAP in the end. 10) In the UC (Cal) system, it isn't necessarily an issue of inside VAPs or trailing spouses, it is more an issue of most jobs going to people with recent degrees from the UC system. Maybe I'm not seeing a representative sample, but it seems like almost every job at UC schools has multiple interviewees with a PhD or postdoc from that school or another UC school, and they tend to get the jobs. Inbreeding looks like a good idea when you think you are a monarchy, but a generation or two later and you might find yourself with a narrow vision and a lack of diverse thinking. 11) Well, that could just be because CA is a big state with a whole like of UC schools. And the fact that CA people often like to stay in CA, so applicant pools are probably largely CA-skewed from the outset.",lol   ,NA,"I love it when I get excited about being on a short list only to be thwarted by 2 strong internal candidates.  At least, they were nice enough to tell me.","non-confidential reference letters One job I'm applying for asks for three letters of reference in the ad- pretty standard...but in their web interface, it becomes clear they want applicants to upload the three letters as files, just like you would any other supporting documentation. So, obviously, non-confidential letters. I don't think I've seen this anywhere before, but maybe I'm way off base. I just feel uncomfortable demanding letters from my lettter writers this way. - any thoughts? 2) Ask the chair of the search committee if they can be sent by the letter writers.  Better to let this one go than to alienate your letter writers by requesting they send you their letters. 3) Yes, contact the search chair - there is probably a mistake in the way HR set up the application procedure. If no search chair is listed you can contact HR or the chair of the department 4) Yep, radio silence from HR, but tracked down the (unlisted!) search chair, who seemed surprised, hopefully just a snafu on HR's end","1) SC member here.  We met the other day to make our short list. Small hairs were split to put people on or off our short list. Someone's not on because their cover letter said they're an X and the ad is for a Y, where X and Y are closely related fields. One of the candidates who is shortlisted doesn't have all of their letters in, according to the HR rules we can't tell them that this will keep them off our short list. Do I break the rules and send an anonymous email to them telling them to get their letter in before the department vote in a few days? I seem to be the only SC member who has noticed this problem. A candidate I'm more interested in is #2 on the reserve list (meaning 2 shortlisted must drop for this person to interview). 2) perhaps email the tardy letter writer? x4 3) #2 makes a good point, but I would also be tempted to inform the applicant anonymously, mostly because that's a really crappy rule and means an otherwise extremely well qualified applicant is being handicapped through no fault of their own. Also, is it possible that the tardy letter writer will not submit a letter even after being prompted by the SC? Informing the applicant gives them the option of having someone else provide a letter if needed. 4) I am curious about X and Y. Let's say the ad is for a broad position in Ecology, saying in the first paragraph ""I am an organismal biologist, or vertebrate zoologist, etc."" is considered bad? I thought it would give an immediate information of the model organism without sounding redundant with the ad. 5) I would advise that you NOT go lone wolf and send an anonymous letter. As someone who has served on 5 or 6 SC (and chaired one) I can promise you that that sort of thing can come back and bite you in the ass in several different ways. It's not worth it. Convince the committee and/or HR to allow you to do it openly or don't do it at all. 6) Agree with #5 - this needs to be done in the open and the same intervention applied to any other short-listed individuals who might be in the same boat.  Any whiff of differential treatment of candidates is opening up the door for all kinds of downstream problems.  7) Do not email the candidate. Anonymously or otherwise.  Rules are rules. 8) #1 you are a good person. Let me share my related experience. I had one letter missing before they noticed candidates the onsite interview. The search committee chair that I do not personally know sent me a quick email that ""we are moving forward the process, and you have one letter missing"". One or two days later, before my letter was in, they called me to let me know that I got the onsite. I want to be clear about two things: 1) it's a private university, and 2) the job ad does not have a hard deadline and it's a open-until-position-filled position, so my letter write can  submit a late letter. Also,  anonymous thing is very odd and I dont think it's a good practice.  9)  If the SC is really interested in a candidate, they should make the effort to remind them to get their letters in. 10) I was in a similar situation where a SC email me through the system to get a missing letter very quick, problem with that letter was that the deadline happen right after a natural disaster and I had specified in my cover letter that the people recommending me were dealing with that. Especially this year, a good way to convince the SC to make exceptions is to argue that there have been so many natural disasters (think in Puerto Rico nonetheless) and that could have influence LOR timing. 11) #1 here again.  To re-state, it is against HR's rules for us to email one candidate to inform them their file is incomplete! No intervention is allowed.  It's an incredibly stupid rule. @4, X and Y are as similar as, say, community ecology and disease ecology. As I said, hairs got split. 12) As a frustrated job applicant who is almost certainly not the person you're referring to, I appreciate that you're trying to do something for someone like me. If you try to make an unfair system better, I really couldn't ask more of you. If that was me, I'd probably only wish that you try to make the rules better on the next round. I'm grateful enough you cared to do something, and most of us would be, too. x2  13) Phone calls are hard to trace and generally not subject to FOIA.  But I agree with the above that you shouldn't do it without the rest of the committee. 14) #1, what school? (worth a shot!) 15) large state school in a large state 16) Tigers?","cold calling This is my first year on the job hunt and still trying to figure out search committees. How common is it for search committees to skip requesting letters of recomendations and cold call references? The few searches I have advanced in, they requested letters after the closing date (I'm not counting the auto request for letters when you submit your application). Should I try not to read too much into this?  2) It's very common for committees to call the references, but in a lot of cases that happens after reading the letter.  Many jobs have started requesting letters only after the first triage round has happened (zero papers apps or off topic apps get kicked out).  The fact that you get letter requests after the due date likely means you are getting in the pile that gets a full read. 3) Is it really common 2? As far as I know, my references have never been called on the phone and I've submitted >75 applications over the last few years and have advanced to shortlist/phone/campus interview at ~20% of those.  4)  I've been job hunting for about 5 years now and my references have been called maybe 2-3 times out of probably 50 applications.  ...and they were never cold calls.  I applied for a job this job season where they called my references, but when looking at the info for the gig on the Facutly Jobs page, it looks like they called references for everyone that applied.  The one other time I can recall, I was long-listed. 5) OP here - thanks for the feedback. Based on the recent post on the Faculty Jobs page, I am not the only one who's references were called. Seems like an odd practice and potentially wasted time if they are calling everyone on the long list. 2) I know my advisor got at least 10 calls.  It's common once you get to the long-list of <20 people.  (My job search was more difficult than those stats make it sound.)","since there's no ""worried"" tab, I'll just insert my comment here. I'm so worried. This is the first time I applied broadly and I'm in despair as I see people started to get LOR requests and/or interviews and I haven't gotten anything. ugh. I really thought this would be the year. There's still some hope though so I'm trying to stay positive. 2) Just wanted to say that you are not alone. 3) Hang in there, buddy. You are not alone. 4) I've been on the market 4 years and have been beaten out by people who haven't even graduated yet, assistant professors looking to move universities, and other folks who are seemingly identical on paper. It is all about department fit and how well your application materials can speak to the job description. The reality is that most of us are on the market for many years due to saturation. I want to tell you to keep your head up and stay positive but reality says you are likely going to bounce around between post-docs and/or VAPs for a few years before you get anything.  5) Yeah it totally blows #1 and the first year on the market is the worst. I think last winter (my first year on the market) was one of my darkest. Somehow you get through it and move forward (either in academia or not). You're valued and loved and are more than a job offer. 6) I wish my first year on the market had been the worst! I only applied to a few jobs, had no expectations, and got a couple phone interviews. I was optimistic! Year 6 is a lot worse... (x2) 7) I'm right there with you. I recently found out that I didn't get a job I felt really really good about and really wanted. I'm worried that this year (like other years) will be a bust. 8) ugh, Fridays are the worst ","Options for non-residents Wondering what research job options exist in US - outside of academia - for foreigners who would require visa sponsorship? It's my understanding that outside of R1/R2, it can be difficult to find jobs that would support immigration. I'm curious as to what y'all think?  2) Close to impossible in my experience. There are a few biotech companies that would sponsor for VISA but only if they really really really want you. 3) You can go the 'National Interest Waiver' (EB2) route, but it's a lot of work and doesn't guarantee acceptance.  My immigration lawyer advised me to get married instead if I could :/ I know people at National Labs who have had their visas sponsored though. 4) Biological scientists make up the lowest proportion of foreign-born workers in science. The majority of foreign-born workers are in chemical, material, medical, or physical science / engineering.","References not submitting letters despite multiple weeks advance notice and follow-up reminders is getting frustrating. As if the job search wasn't already stressful enough.  2) The good news is a lot of search committees will contact your refs directly. They know you don't control the advisors and sometimes requests don't get noticed in the pile of emails.  But yes, that sucks. 3) Yep, been there. First, too many requests going out automatically, please just wait to request for shortlisted people.<-- x1000001 Second, people really need to get their crap together. 4) Bad news is the best search committees will ""hound"" letterwriters to submit letters, but some letterwriters will still miss the deadline. An incomplete applications will often not be considered. 5) I had a letter writer do this too many times last year, so I replaced him with someone else. He was miffed at it (not my phd or postdoc PI mind you, but just a committee member) , but it's my career on the line, and it's better a full application than not. If it's someone you can't replace, then I might suggest looking into Interfolio and having that person deposit a general letter for you, that you can send out whenever you need it since he/she is having problems getting them out on time. 6) Yes - this is a horrible situation. Unfortunately, some senior faculty seem to believe what #2 said (search committee will contact your refs directly). The reality is that at some institutions HR will only release complete applications (which includes cover letters) so the search committee may not ever see the application.","T-T Vs. Continuing assistant professor? What does a continuing assistant prof position, (not TT) mean in terms of job security and resources for lab and research? 2) Depends a lot on the university since a lot of different job types can be lumped into the non-TT prof title. In some places those positions have a lot of job security but not much lab/research resources. Other places they could be cut at the first sign of low enrollment or budget shortfall. In more molecular/bio-med/vet type lines those might be high research positions but with a lot of demand to bring in grant funding to cover part of the position. "
"I'm going insane! Last of 3 interview candidates finished this week.  SC chair told me that they would vote on Feb 4 at a faculty meeting and that the top candidate would get a call shortly after the meeting as an ""unofficial"" notification (apparently the Dean trusts them and has never turned down one of their hire choices).  Anyway, the SC chair also said that there's a chance the Feb 4 meeting would be pushed back a week.  So now on Feb 5, I have no call.  I keep wondering: Did they offer to someone else, or did the meeting get pushed back to next week?????  I don't think my cardiovascular system (or my family) can take another week of this. 1) I know EXACTLY what you're going through! The anticipation is much worse than before the interview. After the interview, I flew home and felt pretty good about the whole thing. I got a good vibe from the SC and in so many ways, got the impression that I was their first pick. But, then day two, day three, day four, and a week goes by, and nothing. I'm starting to second guess myself and feeling like crap. I can't focus on anything. I keep checking in here, in hopes of some shred of information from other candidates. It's driving me insane!!

2) OP here - what's even more frustrating is that I have no idea who the other 2 candidates were. Not that it affected how good or bad I did, but I would like to know who else I was up against. Of course, I guess I'll see at least one of them when they announce their new faculty hire on their webpage a few months from now. :) Oh wait... :(

3) #1 again, yeah, I hear ya on that too. I gave up a while back in trying to figure out who the others were. I'm still curious but I can really halt all productivity (science wise) if I dwell on the other candidate's cv's and qualifications. It's bad enough having the anon quals sheet here. It's a reminder to me that there is a surplus of really outstanding job seekers (competition) out there in this crappy job market. One question for you guys that have gone through this: For those that have interviewed and didn't get the offer, how were you notified? Email? Phone call? Are the rejection letters different at that stage or same ol' insincere stock rejections? 
4) I've just been through the same thing as you guys. First, had a GREAT interview, SC chair told me he was very impressed and that he would be in touch in three weeks, three weeks came and went--no word. Finally, I emailed him, he told me they were having admin troubles, but that a final faculty meeting was set for January 6th. In this email he again told me how impressed they were by me and how they hoped I could hang in there. Jan. 6th came and went. By a few weeks post-Jan 6th, I assumed I didn't get it. In this case there was only one other candidate and I knew who that was AND that he was stellar (far more senior than I) AND that he had been affiliated with the University for many years. I just got the rejection today (via email--they waited until his entire appointment had gone through before letting me know...ugh). I will say, the letter at this stage was not the same ol' form thing. It was quite personal and complimentary. In fact they said they agonized over the decision (although who knows whether this is truth or softening the blow). In general I think knowing who the other candidates are can be difficult during the competition stage, but at the rejection stage (in my case) it was better than not knowing because I, at least, know that the person I lost out to was very, very strong. It's still sucks to ""lose"", though.

5) Damn it! It's 5:00PM and still no email or call. I was hoping to hear word back from the SC before the SuperBowl! This ruined my weekend!

6) @#4 (or anyone else): if the SC chair gives you a specific date they said they would contact you, how long beyond that specific date is an appropriate amount of time before contacting them? I mean, in my case, it's been 1 day past date. I'm hesitant to call in the event that the meeting got bumped to next week. Thoughts from anyone and everyone?
7) I'm waiting to hear from a couple of SC's. For the last search for which I was rejected, it took them 2 weeks to contact me after the chair told me they would. I contacted them a week after the first date and got the run-around. I'd contact them a week from today if I were you. It's HIGHLY likely that the meeting date was pushed back. However, I don't think it hurts to give them a call if you can't wait. 8) #4 here again. I agonized over how long to wait before contacting them, too. In the end I think I was able to hold off for a week before contacting and then it took them another week to get back to me (man, did that week suck). Once I heard back from them, though, I was really glad that I had gotten in touch because I had all these horrible scenarios running through my head, when in actuality they just couldn't get the faculty together to vote on the SC committee's recommendation. I would try to wait a week like #7 suggested, but then I would go ahead and get in touch. Knowing at least a little bit of what is going on makes the process so much easier, if if you end up not getting the job in the end,

9) This process is driving me crazy too. I've stopped submitting apps, have interviewed at 3 schools, and have heard ZILCH from either. I'm tense (paralyzed with anxiety) and just like some of the other posters here, I can't get any work done. I keep glancing at my phone hoping that that SC chair from one of the schools will give me a ring. AHHHH :( (10) Yeah, this absolutely sucks. WTFU, I thought waiting on papers or grants was bad, but this is indeed completely paralyzing. Not sleep, no eating, etc. 
11) Oh yeah, this is much much worse than waiting on grants or papers. It's an emotional roller coaster. The worst part of it all is that as each day goes by without word, not only are the chances that the outcome is favorable for me slimmer but, points off my self esteem go by too, hour by hour, day by day... And then, there's this stupid wiki! On one hand, I love it. It gives me some piece of mind that I don't need to rely on the SC for info. But on the other hand, I'm completely absorbed by it, checking it 30+ times a day. booooh! (12) It must be rough #9, but some of us are desperate to get that first campus interview!

13) I see your point # 12 but, trust me that anxiously waiting to hear back from the SC after you've interviewed (and after the last candidate interviews) is FAR WORSE than waiting to hear back whether you got an interview or not. By the time you've interviewed, candidates have INVESTED so much of their time and effort (blood,sweat, and tears) into the whole process (departmental sleuthing, interview attire, job talk design, job talk practice, leave of absence, etc.) that each day of not knowing is outright PUNISHMENT. Hopes fade and despair sets in as those of us who have interviewed remain in limbo awaiting either the ""promise land"" or our continued pathetic existence in the inferno... Aahhhhh! 14) To #13: This is # 12 again - I sympathize, I really do. I don't suppose you would want to trade places with me?

15) To OP, so what's the latest? Did you call them? 

16) OP here - I called 12 or 13 days after the last candidate to non-chalantly (sp?) ask if he received my hardcopy receipts for reimbursement. The call was never answered and went to voicemail, where I left my message. I then got an e-mail later that day saying ""IT was overhauling their phone system and he hasn't been able to retreive his messages. But he wanted to e-mail just in case I was wondering about my reimbursement receipts."" Yeah, sure you can't retreive messages. Anyway, I replied to the e-mail the next day saying thank you for following up on that. I then politely inquired as to the status of the search. I'll probably see tumbleweeds cross my inbox before he replies back to me. So it's pretty clear that they are in negotiations with candidate #1 and are desperately avoiding communication with #2 and #3. Since the faculty vote was supposed to be about 2 weeks ago, the top candiate is probably coming to a close on either deciding to accept or decline the offer. If I'm #2, I should find out soon. If I'm #3, well then, I've got a helluva lot more waiting to do before finding out for sure. I've mentally moved on from it and I'm now searching out potential postdoc positions for when my current one expires.

As I else noted, it was super fast. Only 3 days after the closing date.  I had submitted my app several weeks early, maybe that mattered. Has anyone else been contacted? 9) Sorry to break the bad news to you #8, but this is likely so fast b/c they already have who they want...the person listed above.  This is such a crock to even advertise and get people's hopes up.  Good luck with the interview!  10) Yup, they had to do it fast because they don't want the Letters from others who might compete. Also, if they are doing it via skype, they must be having budget issues. ITs not exactly dependable. 11) valdosta isn't exactly a heavenly place to live anyway.  Ever been there?  12) #8 here. I'm definitely going in skeptically, if nothing else it is good practice, right?  But about the comment from #9 about the budget issues, I don't see why skype would indicate that at all. I have had one skype interview thus far and greatly preferred that to the phone interviews I have had. 13) Its no different than if the school picks you up in a limo or reserves a used kia sportage for you to drive in to school.  Yes, I've had both.  If the school is trying to impress you, they will act like it. Also, skype is only as good as your internet connection, which even these days is not universally good.  14) But Skype isn't cheaper than a phone call unless the applicant lives out of country maybe - so I don't really see how this means they have budget issues.  15) Its cheaper and less dependable than any phone call I've ever made.  So long as its skype to skype its free. 16) Some candidates (and search comittee memebers) have strong preferences for/against Skpe. I personally hate phone interviews, so I like being able to Skype and see peoples facial expressions as I talk.

Gotta be in it for the long haul.  I'm tired of being a transient though.... 3) That's not even the hardest part - how am I supposed to compete with people coming out of their PhDs with 10 or more pubs? 4) Yes, no 3 nailed it! If I am outcompetetd by a more exprienced person, then at least there is hope that at some point I'll become that more experienced person that can outcompete others. The worst is to compete with those with the same amount of experience but yet somehow much more accomplished than you (a friend of mine had ca. 16 pubs out of their PhD!). 5) Positive affirmation: you'll find your perfect fit someday!

Also only interested in R1, and understand that may mean that it doesn't work out. 8) The R1 (top 10 Eco/Evo) school where I did my PhD had three searches last year in different departments that were at least somewhat related to evolution/ecology/behavior (and all were advertised as assistant prof level). Of the ~15 candidates, I don't think there was one who had finished their PhD in the last 3 years. Many were already profs or had been in postdocs for 5+ years. Obviously that isn't the case at every school, but it was pretty depressing to see when just starting as a postdoc... 9) #6 here, and yep, agree. x3 10) So it's a marathon. I consider that a positive. The alternative is that you get passed over by the new ""young stud/studette"" that is ""full of potential"". It means that if you just keep grinding, there will be light at the end of the tunnel. 11) Trust me, worse is being at the end of the marathon and being passed by someone in first year of a postdoc with a few mediocre pubs that has never brought in a dime of grant support.

Do you try to keep everything under the radar from your department? What do you do about the references? And if you get an interview, how do you let your chair know that you need to take a couple of days off from teaching? I'm genuienly interested in knowing these.3) My chair knows so far, though I am going to keep it closer to the vest this year. I've been interviewing for 2 years and have managed to not miss classes so far. If people ask where I'm going, I'm giving an invited seminar. I've managed to get quite a few interviews, but no offers--maybe due to perceived cost of hiring Asst Prof vs. post-doc or recent phd? 4) Unfortunately, the bar gets higher with academic age.  People can project their hopes onto recent PhDs and base their hiring decision on extrapolating trajectories.  The longer you've been out, it becomes more like ""what you see is what you get"".

I am wondering what this means as I thought that generic letters on my application are available to the search committee. Does it imply that I should ask for tailored letters or that the committee does not see the letters available? I would ask the secretary in a response email but would not want to make a bad impression by some huge misunderstanding, hence this question here. Thank you! 2) It sounds to me like they can't see the letters at all. It would be weird to specifically request tailored letters when they already have generic ones. AJO is a clunky system and you do have to attach your generic letters to each application (they aren't just automatically on there if you had them in a previous application). I'd double check on that end and then email someone to follow up if they appear to be there. 3) Thank you! will email to check!

Long enough for your CV to get better. Some jobs I applied to in November, and still no movement. In that time, I've had a grant ""funded"" that was previously ""pending"" and had a first-author paper move from ""submitted"" to ""in press"". IMO, this moves me from a ""have not"" to a ""have"" in two major sections of my CV (I already have lots of papers but this was the last from my first postdoc). Do I start calling SCs and sending updated CVs? 2) I would! Can also sneak in a word about how you're updating the SC's because you're still enthusiastic about the position   3) absolutely send an updated CV with any new papers or research grants.  It made a big difference in several friends' job searches.   I'd recommend email.

Lol.","Negotiating a postdoc offer 1) Is it ok to negotiate salary for a prestigious postdoctoral fellowship at a really cool location in the US? Or should I just be thankful and take what they offer? I'm not arrogant. I am really happy and honoured about this, but this super cool location also happens to be horridly expensive, so although the salary offered is considerably higher than that for many Midwest professorships in the Negotiations tab, once housing and cost of living are weighed in I might not have that much left to enjoy said cool location. Is it common to ask for more at the postdoc (fellowship) level, or will I be seen as an insufferable prima donna? 2) I tried to negotiate mine and was promptly shut down. 3) I think you absolutely should negotiate, but be prepared to justify the requested amount, like would it be comparable to what a postdoc in a midwestern university would get once adjusted for the cost of living? Or would you be taking a pay cut? I'd also ask about the research/development related funds that you could use for workshop/conference travel, publication costs, etc.  if you get shutdown on the pay raise. 4)OP. Thanks, both! I'll try to tread carefully and enquire about a potential rise with respect to the high cost of living. I ultimately don't really care about a raise, I do however care that what I am earning is enough to get by without having to count every penny =/ 5) A postdoc is a job. Like any job, you should negotiate. I was able to negotiate higher pay, a later start date, and additional funding. All I had to do was ask. Don't get your hopes up, but it can certainly happen. 6) @1, was it Earth institute? 7)OP. Not sure what Earth institute is, so my guess is no. 7) Give it a try, but I've heard plenty of stories about postdocs at super-elite institutions being paid worse than at my midwestern R1. They seem to figure you should be honored to work there. 8) I'm not sure if fellowships might have less flexibility than grant-funded positions, but I know other postdocs who have sucecssfuly negotiated the latter- usually by showing that others in similar poitions a were better paid (i.e. that the offer was below 'market rate'), though perhaps you could adjust this market rate for cost of living if you don't have any direct comparisons. Ditto that professional funds might be a very reasonable place to ask for more. 9) OP. Thanks, all! 10) Agreed, I negotiated my current postdoc salary/hiring status at an ivy in an expensive location. I was giving up a year's worth of funding at previous postdoc in order to move, though, so there was some negotiating power.11) Tangential, but the EI post doc pays less than the post-bac position at AMNH that just came through on Ecolog.

"How long to hold on to an offer?  Hi Everyone. I received an offer from a school that I have some reservations (huge micro, biomed, neuro department, lone ecologist issues, rumored student motivation issues, don't quite ""fit in"", etc.) I have interviewed at 2 other schools and still have applications out. The two other interviews went very well but probably won't hear back for another 3-4 weeks. How long is too long to keep the 1st offer on ice? I'd rather take a position at either of the two schools that I interviewed at than the one where I have an offer.  I've let the sc know that I'd like some time to think about the offer. I have about 2 weeks to let them know. Ultimately, if I don't get an offer else where, I'm strongly considering declining. My postdoc is highly productive and I just landed a hefty grant. The issue of being ""stuck"" at a more than sub-optimal position was discussed earlier here but I just want to get some feedback on my situation. I also don't want to hold up the sc for too long so that if I do end up declining they have enough time to offer to someone else. Thanks in advance. Some schools will be very flexible and give you the time you need. They want you to stay and so giving you that time now may mean the difference between hiring someone now and then hiring again in 2 years when you leave and hiring someone in a month. Other schools won't give you much time at all. It's worth asking for the time and letting the other schools you interviewed at know that you have an offer but remain very interested in them. Doing both of these things may bring the timing together so you can make the best decision. Good luck! (2) Is this UTSA??? (3) If you have already made up your mind, it seems like you owe it to the committee to let them know, and give other candidates a shot. I've already been rejected from everywhere I applied, so have no vested interest in whatever position this is, but I do know, and I am sure you feel the same, that keeping things moving is a plus. Congrats on the offer and the grant!

4) In my opinion, if you already are leaning toward not taking it, holding onto it for more than 2 weeks would be a big disservice to the department and the other 2 candidates (who probably can't sleep a wink at night wondering if they'll get the offer!). I'm not an applicant at any school that sounds like what you describe, so I'm not saying this as self-serving. I think you should take your 2 weeks, which is reasonable, then if you really wouldn't mind passing on this and staying in your postdoc (you said: ""Ultimately, if I don't get an offer else where, I'm strongly considering declining.""), then you should just decline and move on. But only do that if you are truly certain you would not want this job even if you didn't get other offers. Good luck and congrats (on both the offer and the grant!).5) Congrats. It sounds to me like you have already made up your mind-you should trust your sense that this position is not the right fit. We all tend to overthink everything- try not to drive yourself crazy. I think you should tell the department within a week or two at the most.6) Stuck in a sub-optimal position sucks--don't do it!  After 1 year, I want to kick myself for taking the sub-optimal TT job over the sub-optimal (but in a better location) VAP.  My impression (again after 1 year) is that you are more marketable as a post-doc than a 1st year TT member. (7) I'll second '6'. I'm in the same boat. I even had the same thoughts as the OP, but went for it anyway. I wish I had stayed in my old, and by comparison WONDERFUL, postdoc. Now I'm busy trying to get out, all ontop of teaching, etc. (8) #6 again--And trying to get out is tough because it puts you in this weird mind set--I have to act like I am going to go up for tenure here and simultaneously think about getting out.  Drives me (and spouse) crazy and kills my motivation for just about anything.  Ex: I dislike our current living situation, but I do not want to buy a house in this market if we are going to leave in 1-3 years.  Postdocing can be frustrating too, but if you can wait it out, do it.","Nebraska? NC State? Cal Poly?

My best friend got the job.  Our cvs are competely different in every way.  4) OP -- ugh, that stinks. I honestly am happy for this person, but it still just sucks not to get chosen, and reinforces the crazy small-world of my field. 3) ditto. 
","Negotiations x2 1) A word of caution for all those who say, ""Once you have the offer you have all the power. Negotiate your ass off, the worst that can happen is they say no. It's not like they can rescind the offer.""  Last year I submitted my first few R1 applications with pretty good qualifications. Astonishingly, I got an interview. I traveled to this mid-level R1 university figuring I would at least get some good interview experience. The interview went very well, and again to my astonishment, I was offered the job. I immediately started working with all of my colleagues and advisors to make sure I did everything right during the negotiations. First, the person I was negotiating with went on vacation a week after offering me the job, so I had a little time. During their vacation, I wrote a carefully worded query about the possibility of deferring the start date because I had a lot going on in my postdoc (probably the most common request among my new-hire colleagues). A week after they returned from vacation, I emailed to confirm they had received my message. I received a shockingly unprofessional email that, among other things, said I shouldn't start applying for jobs until I'm ready to start working. The kicker in that email was the statement that they were rescinding the offer and had ALREADY offered it to another candidate. I will add much more detail on this cautionary experience once I have secured a job and can look back with less heartreak and disdain. On the bright side, the otherwise great people of the department were furious and the guy got demoted. On the less bright side, they gave the job to the second candidate and now, a year later, I find myself much more qualified but without a single shortlist for >20 applications. So don't forget, the worst thing that can happen when you negotiate is to find that you are negotiating with an overpaid unqualified jackass who takes away everything you've ever worked for and gets a slap on the wrist in return. 2) Ditto to this. I also had an offer rescinded because some alpha male in the department threw a fit and managed to get my offer taken away. So, as 1) says don't think it's in the bank. 3) It's helpful to ask for a written offer as soon as possible, often one that outlines what is in the offer (e.g., salary, start-up). This way you have something on paper that could be used if you wanted to fight it. In my case, the chair of the department called me with the offer then FedEx me a hard copy. We negotiated from there. It gave me a lot of piece of mind in the end. 4)#1 again. I had it in writing too. And apparently so did at least one other candidate at the same time. I've been advised to fight it, but what is the endgame? The other candidate apparently accepted the offer outright. It's not that candidate's fault and they can't take the job away from them. So I would be fighting for them to create another position and let me join a program where the guy who messed it all up in the first place is still a senior faculty member. Also, it would probably become a big deal and I can't afford to be the person who sued a university while I'm still on the job market. I hope my experience, and that of #2, is as rare as I thought it was. Don't worry, I'll publish the whole thing, and name names if the outlet will allow it, once I'm settled in somewhere... assuming I ever get another job offer. 5) Dang. 6) wow! Shocking. it sounds like you might have dodged a bullet by not ending up in a place where that behavior is even somewhat tolerated.

This cuts way back on the work our references need to put in to supporting us, which is great.  But do search committees then look unfavorably on that LOR and therefore on the applicant? 2) This is becoming standard in some fields (e.g. many humanities disciplines). From my perspective, it is often used by faculty to foist off work and expense onto their former students to save a bit of time. For most of these services (i.e., Interfolio) the applicant has to pay a per application or even per letter fee of $5-15 to send their letters unless the search committee at the school you are applying to has covered those costs. That can add up to a big cost for job seekers who are applying to many jobs over several years. I haven't seen it from the search committee side, but I would imagine that in som cases those letters would not be looked on favorably. Of course if everyone has standardized letters then maybe the playing field is even, but that isn't the culture in ecology and evolution as far as I have seen. 3) I don't know, but I think of it this way. Imagine that you are like most people and send out around 20 application per year and it may take you 2-3 years (if you are lucky) to get a job). Do you think your letter writers are going to tailor 40-60 letters for you and the rest of their graduates and postdocs? They may add something each year as your career and cv develops. Moreover, do PIs know the ins and outs of every academic department so they could tailor a letter? 4) I agree that most PIs probably are not doing much, if any, tailoring for most jobs. But I do wonder about the perception of search committees seeing a generic letter. Jobs are so competitive that even a subconcious hint of ""this applicant's PI doesn't care enough to write a personalized letter"" seems like it could make a difference. Plus, using the numbers that #3 suggests, this is asking applicant's to foot something like $3-500 in application fees. 5) IDK, I think a simpler solution is to go to letters just for finalists, or at worst, short-listed applicants. This off loads much of the writing burden from writers, pain of keping track, and costs virtually nothing. In fact it probably saves a lot of $ if you count public prof salary time as $ 6) Agree completely with #5. But the search committees will say that this doesn't work logistically for various reasons. See extensive discussion in row 51 below (this gets re-hashed every year on the wiki).","Trying not to feel bad that, thanks to this wiki, I found out today that I have failed to advance in three searches. Today sucks. x4  2) Sorry to hear, keep applying and you will be the right fit for another job.","interviewing as internal candidate any advice about on-campus interviewing if you're an internal candidate? Anything in particular to keep in mind? The position is in a different department (it was not made 'for' me in any way, I just applied like everyone else), and it is a potentially good fit. I have at least one collaboration in the department already, and I don't know how to treat that (if at all) aside from having disclosed it in the cover letter. Any advice is welcome 2) I currently have a job where there was an internal candidate from a different department. Faculty have told me that the other candidate was very arrogant and entitled to the position and didn't put a lot of effort into the interviewing stage. So, don't do that? We are having another search right now (different) and someone from another department has applied. That person is a good fit and has taken everything very seriously and it's obviously they aren't assuming they are an automatic in, and I think their chances are very good. 3) Avoid anything that would look like a COI.   Don't try to get details about other candidates or their talks.  If your dept is on the up and up they will tell you that you cannot attend their job talks or chalk talks.   You have an advantage in knowing the landscape of the department.  But be aware many faculty may push back against the hire just because you are internal.  Many people you already know will probably behave more formally or push back with hard questions.   That doesn't mean they are against you, just that they are doing their job.   ""If we are hiring our own, why doesn't my favorite pdoc get a job?""  Try not to take those comments personally when they come up.   Do the best you can and focus on the research as much as possible.   Whether you get this job or not, it will be good practice.   Good luck. OP) Thanks posters, that's really good advice. I was worried there might be some animosity about it, but truthfully no one's more surprised about it than me. They've been very good about not disclosing who the other candidates are or when they're speaking. And I never heard anything about the search, I actualy thought I was out of contention until I got the call. On the off-hand chance that I actually get the job there--does that resentment go away or will it just be something I have to deal with? 5) The problem with being an internal hire is that the existing faculty see you as an upgraded postdoc, not as an incoming faculty. Will need to remind them. As a grad stduent I saw an internal candidate hired, then not respected, for this reason.  This person was a star, and had no problem upgrading to a job elsewhere. 6) When interviewing as an internal candidate, don't assume that they know your work, even if you have been working directly for them. They'll tend to forget some of your contributions unless you remind them where it's relevant during the interview process. Also, some hiring processes may insist on not using context that they have from sources other than your application materials and interview -- make sure you know what the ground rules are. OP again) thanks so much for the feedback--my interview went pretty well I think. It wasn't nearly as weird as I expected, HR super focused on treating candidates the same which helped. I wasn't sure if it would be harder or easier as a quasi-internal candidate, but think it was about the same. There were some things I didn't have to worry about (getting lost of campus) but some things I did (showing I could transition into their department from my current one) 7) I was on a search where a current post doc on campus made the on-site interview pool.  Candidate did not perform well.  What was shocking was the lack of homework/preparation the candidate did for the interview and some lack of professionalism.  Candidate was rated unacceptable by the faculty and the whole interview processes was an unpleasant experience (even for grad students who had no previous contact or really even knew candidate's status).  I am not sure if the candidate did not feel the need to prepare (though was all prepped by being on-campus already) or if this was just how the candidate interviewed for jobs more generally.  For any faculty job interview, do your homework, know who you are talking to, ask questions.  All of these things should be easier for a candidate already at the institution and therefore the committee will generally have a high bar for that preparation for any candidate already at the institution.  Hopefully a search committee will do a good job and treat all candidates the same.  Candidates should respond in-kind and prep for an interview like they are headed off campus.  Don't assume people know you and your work.  Invision working with people outside of your current post-doc mentor(s)/collaborators.  Clearly demonstrate how your research program will be independent of those post-doc mentor(s)/collaborators (because if it is not, there is no reason to hire you, because the post-doc advisor is already working for the institution).  Be professional - there is a temptation to be a little too casual if you already know the place/people. I have also seen these types of candidates rock the interview and get an offer, so certainly can and does happen.    ","Time-from-degreeism, or am I just a whiner? I am 8 years out from PhD. Have generated $ as PI and published a lot (mostly as 1st author but not so much so to suggest I am a non-collaborating diva), been a PD at an excellent institution. This past year, I have seen 2 VERY new PhDs (0 to 1 year out from degree) hired into pretty decent TT jobs. And stalking the jobs I didn't get, I see several very new PhDs (with concomitantly low # of pubs and scant evidence of getting grants). Obviously, there's fit, specialization, etc etc but seriously? My thought was always that I should get independent pubs and grants under my belt before the big job push, but now it seems I've aged out. Anyone else getting the feeling that it's too late? I realize it isn't explicit ageism (though perhaps by proxy) but I'm scared there's a big trend towards ""young"" trainable (inexperienced) and cheap. Your thoughts?  2) Who knows why and why not people get hired. Jeremy Fox def has data on this, and from memory while the median age to hire was probably something like 3-4 years, folks that are >8 years old *do* get hired. But from personal experience, I am feeling the same way as you - I feel like I did *too* good a job of establishing myself as a postdoc and now committees don't get excited by my ""potential"" because I'm already reaching my potential. But this is also just my way to justify my lack of interviews to mysel, which is surely not accurate.  3) I'm sure blog guy will post a link to his blog about this, but until then, I would say that I know two amazing postdocs that got great jobs last year - one was 8 years out, the other 7. Other than that, I think 2 is so right: there is not a lot of logic in the selection proces, there are just waaaay too few jobs. So, as hard as it is to feel this way, not getting a job is not a reflection of you skil, background, or worth. It's just a bad time to be going after these jobs. 4)@1 you're just a whiner, maybe you should take a closer look to your application material, you may not be as good as you think you are. This is the venting thread, I know, but I feel lthat people like you who resent ""all the time you've spent establishing yourself"", make it difficult to the rest of us. The secret is quality, not quantity. 5) To #4: You're just another bully.  (X6) Don't lecture people about their ""quality"" when you don't know shit about them. To OP: Hang in there. I'm on the same boat, and I'm experiencing the same. Seems a never ending process to me. 6) Jeremy Fox from Dynamic Ecology here. For broader context, #2 remembers the data correctly. The ""typical"" recently-hired TT ecologist was hired 3-4 years post-PhD, though anything from 2-5 years is common. 8 years or more is very rare but not unheard of: https://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2018/01/04/when-did-newly-hired-n-american-tt-ecology-faculty-get-their-phds/ 7) OP again. Thanks Fox for injecting data into the convo, it helps! Thanks all-except-#4 for the feeling that it's not just me. #4 if you find yourself saying ""I know it's the venting thread but"" and/or ""people like you""...don't. Also u r no make sense. 8) I suspect #4 is one of those racist faculty members who are pissed, and scared that their BS is being exposed by these revealing discussions, and a potential lawsuit. 9) OP have you been postdocing since you finshed your PhD? and may I ask how long you've been in the job market and/or how many applications you've submitted total? Just curious, and trying to get some perspective other than my own, I'm rather junior, just a second year postdoc. Thanks and good luck!  10) OP in response to #9: I spent 2 years as visiting sci in a gov research facility before starting PD. I have been intermittently applying over last 3 years, admittedly in a picky way as I have family limitations on geographic regions that will work. Total apps probably ~50, this year to date is 15. 11) Is lower number of 8 year out hires because there are fewer of them or because they are hired at a lower rate? Hopefully the former is true.   12) Agree with #5, #4 is a bully who knows nothing about the OP. And I agree that a lot of hires are based on ""potential"" rather than proven quality. This frustrates me a lot. If the trend is to hire someone of out their Ph.D. for their ""potential"",  this disincentivizes folks to spend some time producing really high impact research. "" Why should I spend 4-5 years doing a Nature or Science-worthy project and aged out of the market when I can just publish small papers quickly and get hired based on 'potential'?"" 13) Jeremy Fox from Dynamic Ecology here. Although I only have 3 years worth of data and so can't comment directly on whether mean time-since-degree of newly-hired TT ecologists has dropped over some longer timespan, I'd caution against *assuming* it has. As for whether hires are based on ""potential"" or ""experience"", I can tell you that, among newly-hired TT ecologists at R1 unis, there's only a very weak and noisy correlation between years since PhD and # of first-authored papers. Same is true if you restrict attention to first-authored papers in ""leading"" journals (operationally defined as journals with 2-year impact factor >3). Publication productivity does vary widely among newly-hired ecologists at R1s, but that variation isn't much correlated with years post-PhD. See here: https://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2018/10/02/how-many-first-authored-papers-in-leading-journals-does-an-ecologist-need-to-be-hired-as-a-tenure-track-asst-prof-at-an-r1-university-not-nearly-as-many-as-most-ecologists-think/. Further, 52% of those new hires at R1 unis have at least one Science/Nature/PNAS paper, and 26% have a first-authored Science/Nature/PNAS paper. And although we're getting into very small sample sizes here, FWIW the new hires at R1s who have Science/Nature/PNAS papers got their PhDs only a bit earlier on average than all new R1 hires (mean year of PhD is 2012.6 for new R1 hires with Science/Nature/PNAS papers, vs. 2013.4 for all new R1 hires). Obviously, you can't use my data to reconstruct the search committee's thinking for any particular search, or to second-guess the outcome of any particular search. But at a *systemic* level, I don't really see any sign in these data that lots of R1 unis are hiring very junior people who haven't yet ""achieved anything"", or who are only publishing ""small"" papers, or who haven't yet had time to produce Science/Nature/PNAS papers. 14) #9 here, thanks OP, I hope this year is the year you get a job. I also hope this year is the year I get a job even though is my first year on the market. I guess I would have to be hired based on potential rather than publication record and grants. I know for sure that my wallet, my personal life, and my relationships will not last for 5 more years of postdoc life :( I'm currently in a long-distance relationship with my SO, also a postdoc, and we both got into a a lot of debt transititiong from grad school to postdoc. I also want to have children and I can't pursue those other personal goals while in this situation. I can imagine a senior postdoc being frustrated if I get hired, but then again, I hope I get something this season and wish the best to everyone else. 15) See #4? How much on stake here? Oh, you can't see, maybe cause you got the privilege of being White? Even if you claim you're not, you're STILL a bully. Don't be coward, come out of closet, and admit that you're a racist bully. 16) How is what #4 said in any way racist? They were just reacting to OP's somewhat boastful remarks x2 12 here) to #13 Jeremy Fox, thank you for being so enagaged in this forum, we have benefited a lot from your data, input and advice. Your data showed only 26% have a first-authored Science/Nature/PNAS paper...These papers takes years to to do. Why would someone be incentivized to produce such papers when 2 Am Nat papers from a 2yr postdoc is sufficient for a faculty position, and not be aged out by producing a Science/Nature/PNAS? The majority (74%) do not have a Science/Nature/PNAS first-authored publication. The postdoctoral system is broken 13) Jeremy Fox here again. I wouldn't advise anyone to use my data to decide what papers to write and where to submit them. But there’s a bit that can be said. And the thrust of my previous comment may not have been a bit unclear, so I’ll try again…As my data illustrate, you certainly don’t have to have a Science/Nature/PNAS paper to get hired into a TT position at a research university. And I agree that it’s a bad idea as a TT job seeker to save up most or all of your results for several years, publishing little or nothing in the interim (a least, not as first author), in order to try to fold all of your results into one Science/Nature/PNAS paper. That’s a risky strategy because Science/Nature/PNAS might well reject your paper (obviously!). Plus, search committees at research universities want to see evidence that you can run your own strong, sustainable, long-term research program; they don’t want to hire a one-trick pony. If you are several years post-PhD, a single Science/Nature/PNAS paper plus few or no other papers is not very good evidence of your ability to run a sustainable long-term research program. Which presumably is why newly-hired TT ecologists who have a Science/Nature/PNAS paper never *just* have a Science/Nature/PNAS paper. Rather, they mostly *also* have at least 1-2 papers in leading ecology journals. How did they manage that? Well, one reason is that it’s not true that Science/Nature/PNAS papers necessarily take several years from study conception to submission. Sure, some Science/Nature/PNAS papers do—but many others don’t. I have a Nature paper, for instance (from after I became a faculty member). It took less than a year from study conception to submission. I mention this not to brag, or to suggest that others should adopt my research methods, but just to illustrate that Science/Nature/PNAS publish various sorts of ecology papers that vary greatly in how much time they take to complete. No one should infer that the newly hired ecologists who have Science/Nature/PNAS papers must’ve saved up all their results for several years for a single Science/Nature/PNAS paper, that got them hired just in time before they “aged out” of the faculty job market. 12 here again) Thank you Dr. Fox for the input, I am not saying in any way that folks should save up data for that one Science/Nature/PNAS paper. I am saying that the system doesnt incentivize folks to do that, to take some risk and some time to produce a big paper, when there is time-from-degreeism bias as suggested by the OP. I have seen colleagues who have a Science/Nature/PNAS paper and some smaller papers and a long postdoc being passed over for younger folks with only the smaller papers based on arguments of ""potential"". x2 13) Confused why PNAS is being lumped in with Science/Nature. It's not in the same league, and is really depedent on whether an NAS member takes interest in the MS. x3 14) I don't think it matters anymore if an NAS member takes interest since they did away with the two stream submission system. But agree that it isn't in the same league with Science and Nature (why it is Post Science And Nature). 15) It still does, because you still need to suggest a NAS member to oversee the review. But yeah, contributed PNAS papers were (or still are?) BS. 16) @13 And getting a Science/Nature paper is totally dependent on whether an editor takes interest in the MS.  At least NAS members are experts in the field, unlike Nature editors. 17) My PhD advisor, who's ""a big name"" in my area, said that 5 yr postdoc or longer could be red flag. They said this while I was serving as a grad rep for a search committee and they were giving me advice on how to select the first short-list. They said that if candidates had been postdocs for more than 5 yrs then ideally they've been in the same lab and not jumping from position to position, that I should pay extra attention to LOR and make sure they are outstanding and expect them to have an incredible list of publications. That time, we interviewed a person that had been a postdoc for 8 years but he didn't get the position, mostly because he did not do well during the interview. He was amazing in paper though, but his job talk and exit interview were sloppy and was very unimpressive compared to his CV. In summary, maybe other search committees are like this too? Maybe they expect way too much from people who've been postdocing for long? 18) @17, I don't know the details of the case, but in general this sucks. Academia used to be a place where talanted people who are also a bit weird/asocial/loner could florish. Now departments want more and more alpha types who would look good in front of a camera. 19) So, basically, if you moved labs as a postdoc because your boss was an abusive ass who refuses to write reference letters, red flag for you. 20) @17: This is interesting. I totally agree with you, #18, and #19 as well. This sucks big time. Problem with these search committee members, and chairs who're putting these experienced postdocs under that kinda microscope is that they never even thought that they will NOT pass such scrutiny either, if they had to go through similar scrutiny. Few months ago I was invited for an R1 on-campus interview, and I was interviewed for 3 long days. Yes, when other candidates were interviewed for 1.5 days (clearly double standard), I, as the first candidate, was being interviewed over, over, and over, many times by the same faculty members, let alone all those personal questions (age, marital status etc.) by them that they were strictly prohibited to ask. It's just hard to hold your composer in that kinda situation, trust me. And guess what, I was not offered the position. And if you're reading this, and think that this might be referring to you, it probably is. 21) to #13, PNAS is probably lumped in with Science/Nature so the % will reach 25%. If you just focus on Nature/Science, it is probably way less.............. 22) Jeremy Fox from Dynamic Ecology here. @21: No, I didn't lump in PNAS to game the percentages, or out of any other ulterior motive. Why would you think I would do that? I included PNAS in the compilation because they're a leading general science journal that in the minds of many (by no means all) folks is a step up from ecology-specific journals. I'd be happy to go back and break out the data for Science/Nature only if that was something lots of people wanted to see.  21 here) Oh nono. I didn't mean it that way. This is just in response to to the other poster who mentioned that PNAS is of a different level than Nature/Science. What I want to say is, when you add PNAS in, then it would be 25/26%, but if you exclude it the % would be way less. Sorry Dr. Fox for the misunderstanding. I certainly did not mean it that way. 23) Jeremy Fox here, thank you for the clarification #21, and no worries. ","Postdoc question Curious question for everyone. When is it okay, or is it, to ask about postdoc applications? Since they're not updated on here and I haven't heard about one I applied to for almost a month, I was curious how long an appropriate time to wait to ask was. Or even if it is appropriate to ask. I'm not applying for many postdocs at all, so I'm less seasoned in this area. 2) You don't want to sound submissive, but I think it's ok to enquire about the status if you have a reason to (e.g. you received another offer). If you don't have another offer and just want to enquire because you're anxious, I guess I'd try to summon my strength and let it run its course (I know I'm making it sound easier than it is... sorry, I'm on the same boat!) OP) Makes sense. For all of the R_ and SLAC jobs I just focus on other things and not think about them. I can do the same with this certainly. It's all so much fun I might explode! 3) Just ask 4) For both of my postdoc positions, one advertised by a faculty member and the other a competitive fellowship, I waited til I assumed I probably wasn't getting the position (probably 3 weeks and 6 weeks after interviewing, respectively) but really needed to know where I was going to be living 2 months from then, and then emailed. In both cases I got positive responses, and ended up with offers. So I agree it doesn't hurt to ask! ","Where are all the ecology jobs?!! Job season just started and I'm already feeling hopeless :( x4 2) Don't stress out just yet. Most departments are having their first faculty meeting of the year, so there will be plenty more jobs to come. 3) Have a look at last year's spreadsheet (link is still up so easy to do), and just browse at when the jobs were posted. You will see that the vast majority of jobs are posted after mid-September. Assuming similar timeframe for this year, we still have a long way to go. 4) Yeah I also hate how specific a lot of these jobs are becoming. It's getting rarer and rarer to see general ""ecology"" postings. 5) Try being on the ""evo"" side of ""ecoevo"". There are SO few this year. 6) My dream job wasn't even posted until December (I got it!). Another one came up in April. 7) Seriously.....god forbid someone studies ecology without genomics/microbiomes/disease, etc. x3 8) don't forget ""global change"". x2 9) If you can't find a way to shoehorn your science into any given position, you're not trying hard enough. 10) I dunno. I can see how shoehorning oneself can backfire if you're hired to teach & research Y when you're actually more interested and an expert in X. 11) Shoehorning doesn't work if there are people in the applicant pool who align with what the department actually wants. x2 12) Agreed, its still early. My school is anticipating a cluster hire, but we are still awaiting approvals and any positions are unlikely to be announced until this winter/early next spring... I also agree with shoehorning to a degree - don't say you can do something you can't, but if you are reasonably versed in say, fisheries, and are comfortable teaching it, even if your expertise is in marine ecology of seagrass, still apply. In my experience, its more about fit with the department than the exact study system.  13) Apply for everything that is relevant-ish.  I've seen comp bio hires that went to someone who by their own admission does not know math.  A big data hire that went to a single gene mol bio lab, and a microbiome hire that went to a person who hasn't published on bacteria at all.  Send the app in and try to talk fit, but know that a lot of schools will pivot for good candidates. ","No reference from postdoc supervisor - is this a problem? For a number of reasons, I would prefer not to request a reference letter from my postdoc supervisor. I'm wondering how much a problem this is going to be for search committees? My CV shows that I've been productive over the last couple of years, but my supervisor and I do not communicate very well despite our ongoing efforts and as a function of this I've found it difficult to grasp the expectations my supervisor has for me and whether or not I am meeting them, etc. The tl;dr is that I am not convinced I'd get as strong of a letter from my supervisor as I would get from other colleagues at my current institution or past institutions. Is this likely to be something that will raise such a flag that I'll either (a) have to defend it, or (b) not get an interview in the first place?? And if it's something that I need to address, is there a best practice for navigating this? 2) I'm sorry you have to deal with this. My impression is that not having your current advisor as a reference is going to bother some committees and that you probably have to defend it somehow. If you have another writer that you really trust, it might be possible to have them briefly describe the situation in their letter. 3) I agree with #2. It will be noticed that there is no letter from your current advisor. Best to have another letter-writer address this, and if this can't be done then you need to do it probably in your cover letter. 4) I am in a similar situation; my direct supervisor is really only a name on paper, but I have a lot of unofficial postdoc ""mentors."" They don't know me as well as former advisors, but I decided to have one of them be a letter writer from now on to limit any red flags.  5) Better to drop it than to use a bad rec.  People told me not to b/c it would be a red flag.  I wish I'd dropped the asshole among my rec letters sooner.  I wouldn't have my current position if I hadn't. 6) Having served on several SCs, I would recommend not including them as a reference. Just my two cents, but if you have an excellent record, and others (i.e., PhD adviser) indicate that you're sane, then the SC will want to chat with you. Far too many SC members make assumptions about applicants' motives and behavior. It's ridiculous, and time to focus on what matters -- namely what you've accomplished in your career to date. Generally speaking, if you suspect a person would write a negative letter for you, you're likely correct. I think a negative letter from a current postdoc adviser is more damning than whatever assumptions some SC member might make about you (my colleagues are reasonable, and SC members rarely push their own agenda, so we might be an outlier). OP) Thanks #6. I'm not asking for a letter, but I did put his contact info on my long list of references that goes at the end of my CV. His contact info is easily available online and it would be abundantly clear from my position and the structure of our org that he is my supervisor, so if they're going to do any reference calling beyond letter writers (which I've been informed that on occasion SCs at this institution will do), they could easily track him down. Considered not putting him on that list either but figured that would be a little beyond odd. I'm not sure that he'd write/give a totally negative reference, but I'm just not sure it would be as glowing as others. I have a good record/strong CV and have always had great references from previous supervisors/PIs/mentors (incl. PhD advisor), this is just a outlier and is majorly stressing me out. Only applied to one position this cycle (am getting picky / disillutioned in my old age I guess) but fingers crossed it pans out bc it ticks nearly all of my ideal job boxes! "
"Farewell Academia!! I'm seriously considering leaving academia. After a run in the job hunt, rejection after rejection (jobs and my last grant app), and pressure to provide some REAL money (NIH and NSF postdoc salary standards are PEANUTS!!!!), I've decided to try my hand at something else. I love my research (and I'm damn good at it too!). I always have. Since I was a kid in grade school, I've known I wanted to be a scientist. So passion is not lacking but in reality, the odds are against most of us. Has striving for a TT position become what striving to be a pro-athlete or hollywood star is to others? HOOP DREAMS...   Anyways, I'm curious to know who here is seriously considering leaving academia for something else? I know many of you threaten to do it, but who really is doing it?  (1) I did it.  Well sort of.  I took a career track job as a consultant in the energy industry, but because science is still my passion, I am trying my hand one more year (it has been only a few months since I started at my new job).  I know, pipe dreams, as I haven't produced much (anything) publication-wise since taking my private sector job.  Sometimes I am wondering why I am trying to go back to academia...My private sector job pays well, I have reasonable hours, actual vacation, and as a result a more balanced life.  I have given myself this year to try my hand again, and then I will walk away.  With a free spirit.  By the way, I left because of all of the reasons you cited, but most importantly to have some stability for me and those that depend on me (postdoc-ing indefintely wouldn't have cut it for any of us).  Good luck with whatever path you choose.                                                                                                                                                                            2) I'm seriously considering it mostly because it's hard to move from place to place once you have a kid of school age and my spouse's job has become increasingly less flexible. The frustrating thing for me is I feel like I am pretty close to being able to make it happen (interviews, great feedback, still publishing, etc.) but now that I can't move for another post-doc, I don't know how I will continue to keep being competitive after I get the last few papers out from this one. That is one of the worst things about this field, we have to keep finding new research projects if we want to stay in it and new research projects generally involve large scale moves. I had to move for spouse's job while I finish the analysis and writing for last post-doc. I spend all day working my butt off to get my papers out, but I have stopped being paid...I can only hold out as a self-funded post-doc for so long. THE BIG PROBLEM is that I just can't think of (or find) anything else I want to do. I would love to hear from people who may have had better luck finding something rewarding outside of academia.
3) When MJ is legalized, I'm goin AGGIE (or shall I say GREEN). Looks like that'll happen before this job market picks up. You can then call me Dr. FeelGood.  (4) I've thought seriously about this too.  My biggest issue is that as grad students we arent trained for any other job - i would love to go into conservation or a government position but all of those either require a phd (have that) PLUS 5 years directly applicable experience (nope, just academic science albiet somewhat conservation oriented) OR someone with a Master's - so i dont know what someone education & experience in between these two (a Phd & postdoc experience in ecology/evol bio) is supposed to do outside of academia.  suggestions welcome! sorry i cant be more helfpul.  BUT i do have friends who've made it to conservation orgs or government and are SO happy they made the change over. good luck!
5) I'm still in the job market, mostly waiting for SCs to decide whether or not they are going to hire me. Chance are I won't get an offer. Why?, because I'm a pessimist.  Anyways, I'm cooking up a plan for an independent research org. I'm going solo. What the hell, I've got nothing to lose. If I get the job, I'll apply for funding as an assistant prof. If I don't get it, I'll still apply. And, if I don't get the grant, I'll get a loan. I'm tired of depending on someone else to determine my future!                                                                                                                                                                               6) This is a good plan and I have thought of it as well, quite seriously. There are, unfortunately, two snags I have run into. First, we can't apply for funding from the usual organizations (NSF, etc.) on our own because we don't have PI status. One option there is to get PI status from a university, perhaps the one from which we got our PhD, but this can be nearly impossible, or not too difficult depending on the institution. As for getting a loan, pretty tough these days depending on what your start up costs would be. I do conservation/landscape genetics so these would  not be trivial and without the promise of big profits in return, most lenders balk. I'm not saying this option is impossible and I still think about trying it out, but it is not as easy as it might sound, unfortunately.  (7)  I totally agree with the OP.  Getting a job in academia is like making pro sports or becoming a rock star.  Even if you are smart and work hard, a few missteps can make it impossible, and even then, if you don’t “fit in” there is no hope.  At some point (age) one needs to start making real money.  As far as options, I don’t have good ideas.  I used to do more applied/gov. ecology work, but then went basic eco/evol. bio. for grad school.  After that went back into more applied stuff, that I enjoyed research-wise, but left because the positions was poorly managed and they were conflicts between my supervisor and others that I was asked to work with.  I was stuck in the middle.  I am now doing very basic evol. bio. theory as a post-doc at in an Ivy.  I have been looking for many types of permanent jobs for the last 3-4 years.  Other than for post-docs, I have only had interviews for “real jobs” in state and fed government.  Both turned out to be “inside candidate” situations, which seem to be the case for nearly all jobs on USAJobs.  I also applied to the Census Bureau, but they rejected the application for some reason I couldn’t determine.  I might try there again.  Outside of most formal TT searches, most jobs are acquired through the “network” or “good-‘ol-boy” method.  From my experience, once you get outside the network, it is hard to get back in.  As far as alternatives go, I have been thinking a lot about that as this will be my last post-doc.  Truth is, most of us here are very highly skilled, and would be extremely valuable in almost any employment situation.  Think banks, insurance companies, accounting, retail, bio-tech/pharma, etc.  Most of these are suffering now too.  Pick where you want to live, and make it work.  Most people with less education and intelligence, make it work far sooner than and without moving as much as us.  Other than that, apply to everything.  Don’t be afraid to quit academia.  If you have to stay in academia to be happy, find the place you want to be and try to get PI and Adjunct status.  Then write grants and/or teach for (almost) free, and maybe get a second job (wait tables) for extra money.  This is my plan if something doesn’t happen in the next year or so.   (8) Although still academia this is probably our future:  http://chronicle.com/article/Why-PhDs-Should-Teach-in/63993/ (9)  Have been considering it for years, with ZERO luck making the move.  Not exactly sure why--maybe the old adage ""Those who can't do...."" applies.  I have been searching for someone who recently made the academia-->govt or consulting switch.  Not many out there.  Best site I have found is http://www.leavingacademia.com/","Worcester Polytechnic Institute For those that interviewed, have you heard any news?  (1) Email from the SC chair last week saying they had just completed interviews the week before and had begun deliberations (2) On the other hand, the SCC hasn't even sent me a rejection (while some people are getting updates)! ",NA,NA,NA,"I am really surprised there are so few reports of contact from committees for so many positions after long lags since deadlines passed.  seems thinner than most years. 1) Agreed. This is a bit odd. I know that in past years there have been large numbers of jobs that have little/no update info entered. I suspect that A) not everyone knows about the jobs wiki, B) some people do not update info when they get it, and C) some search committees are dragging their feet this year. 2) I hope its more C this year.  This is the thinnest I can remember it looking, unless of course people are unaware. Maybe one of us should post on Ecolog again like has been done in the past.  It woudl sure help I bet!  3) It could be the search committees do not send out rejection Letters, so the number of people that are essentially reached, are those 3-4 that were placed on the shortlist. 4) I agree, I update the wiki when I hear back but I've only heard back from the few jobs that want to phone interview me, not the larger number of jobs where presumably I didn't make the first cut. 5) Same boat as #4.  I have applied for 20 positions so far and have only heard back from 1 that offered a phone interview. 6) Have 6-7 apps out and have not heard much of anything, but I update the wiki as I get information. 7) I have always had at least 3 interviews per semester when searching.  This year zero.  Makes me think a lot of searches are moving slower than usual this year. 8)I'm on a visiting contract at a school that has posted the TT line (deadline was 10/15), which I've applied for.  The search committee had originally internally blocked off interview times starting yesterday (11/18), and for four weeks following.  The search committee just met on 11/15 still narrowing down the short list.  They may still be narrowing it down, or they may have submitted the list to HR, or I may have just not made the shortlist, but they're not saying anything.  Regardless, they are well behind their original schedule. 9) I doubt that search committees are on average any slower this year. This doesn't make sense to me. I am guessing there are a lot of applicants and schools don't send out rejection Letters until somewhat late in the search. Only a very small proportion of people applying for these jobs take the time to visit this site or update (although I wish they would!!).  10)  To #9, you might want to look at the job ads this year compared to previous years (see below).  in fact, right now we have the most vacancies advertised in almost a decade, more this year than some entire years relatively recently.  The last three years have been signficantly higher than the previous decade.  It probably reflects the economy which may not seem better now, but its more stable now.  However, dec and Jan ads are way down.  11) #9 here..Thanks #10...Just read below. I am skeptical that there is an aross the board dearth of candidates this year. But if so, that is great news for me. It would be nice to be in a job seeker's market for once.  12) #10 here for #9, I am too.  The only reason I'm at all suspicious is that a) it feels like things are moving slow, b) more jobs are posted, c) there are rumors a good chunk of candidates left the market last year, d) search committees were on here complaining about small fields.  Combined, that seems to support that this is a good year for us.  Even the number of people applying for the same vacancy seems low this year (of course a lot of us probably don' tmark that.  for example, Murray St. had a ton of us apply, but most others are only 1-2, but I put very little faith in that last point. e) several searches have extended their deadlines Murray did it, and several others.","I've gotten so close sooo many times. I know it's great to even get to the interview stage but it's so discouraging that my CV looks good but it never works out after the in person.  Crappy thing is, I usually feel like the interview went really well.  What gives? 2) Happened to me as well. I guess it is not how good you are, it is how good the other candidates are compared to you. 3) If you are interviewing at SLACs and you get a teaching demo, you have to ROCK that teaching demo. If you are used to teaching a lot and anticipating timing, just make sure you know when things (like short discussions) need to be done so you can get where you want to get. If you aren't used to teaching (at least inquiry-based teaching) PRACTICE. I didn't practice mine, but I've done lots of this stuff and I think it showed. But I think anyone who cares and has some background in teaching could pull it off with practice and enthusiasm. And don't be afraid to bribe those kids to participate with candy. And have them put their names on notecards in front of them so you can call them by name. And do not just get up there and give a standard lecture. Rocking your research seminar goes without saying, but I think a lot of people neglect the teaching demo in favor of perfecting the research seminar and you cannot do that. Also DO NOT underestimate fit. I interviewed at one SLAC where I admittedly just was not going to fit (very religious with religious bio faculty), and they also didn't have me do a teaching demo. I didn't get that offer and beat myself up about it. But the second place I had a teaching demo and fit could not be more perfect, so I came away fully expecting and wanting an offer, and I got it. Sorry to say how much fit matters because it is something you can't do much about. But no matter how well you might seem to fit otherwise, if your teaching is lacking, you will not get the job. 4) I completely understand! The whole ""fit"" thing might explain a couple of rejections after campus interviews (at R1s, at least based on my experiences), but when that number starts to creep up, you start wondering if there's something about your personality or interview skills that throws people off...but then when no one in your support group honestly thinks that's the issue, you're really rather lost. I know I am! It's only a small consolation that I see the departments (that rejected me after interviews) offered the jobs to candidates with more experience than me (current assistant professors and whatnot)...I still can't help wondering what I did wrong. Sigh. I know I should be grateful for getting any interview at all, but rejections after in-person interviews do feel a bit more personal... 5) OMG. I thought I was the only one experiencing this!!! Wow, I am so glad there are others out there dealing with this. To go on so many campus interviews and never get job offers was really starting to bother me, but this is exactly the reality jolt I needed to wake up and realize it might not be (totally) my fault. I will also concur with what #3 said in that I know the teaching demo has been my downfall at least once. I don't think their suggestions above are all to be heeded, but there is a lot of truth there. Good luck, comrades.   6) I have gone through the same thing #4.  On one interview I was standing around the corner and heard one person commenting to another how charismatic I was.  So, I have since abandoned that notion.  However, I do know that if you apply to a school full of faculty who are not able to be productive for some reason, and you are, they will be irritated with you no matter what you do! :)  Just keep swinging I guess. 1) Didn't give up and got a TT job! :) #3 again) congrats OP on the TT!!!!","Negotiations: email or phone? Amirite? 2) sure...if you study things with bones. 3) So far, so good with me.  ;)  ....and my study organisms typically do have bones.  3) Not really, tons of these vacancies were advertised last year. 4) It's a pretty light year for ecology/evolution jobs at quality SLACs....totally the opposite for molecular biology positions at these institutions though! 5) What #4 said.  I study plant ecology and am looking for a SLAC job.  Slim pickings this year, compared to other types of jobs. ","I feel like job ads mean almost nothing.  Just got a interview in one field but was told that my talk needs to be entirely focused on another research area.  Fine, that can be done, but if they have a clear idea of what they want, why not just say it?? 2) Looking at those being interviewed for postitions listed as totally open is annoying when you see that candidates are all say evolutionary geneticists, and you do global change biology. So much time wasted. 3) The search committee may not know what it wants when it begins, or it may not be able to say what it wants for administrative reasons. All the same, it's a huge waste of time for the majority of people who apply. Inquiring may help, sometimes, but not when there's 411 applicants all writing to ""learn more about the position""",NA,"University of VA ad for a 1 semester adjunct position: ""Compensation will take the form of wages."" But hey, it's a step up from that last adjunct gig that only paid in old farm equipment and used office furniture...2) They did not say what currency said wages will be in! My hope is beer, or at least fermentables. 3) They actually meant to write 'pages' - adjunct will be allowed to use campus printing for free as the sum total of their compensation.","letter writing Writing a letter for one of your students who isn't very good, is not a fun thing to do. How to give a fair evaluation? 2) The starting point is telling your student what you can and can't say in your letter and making sure they are comfortable with that.  If you give them this information and they still want you to write the letter, then you go ahead and write an honest, candid, but fair letter.  If you never had this conversation with your student then things are more difficult.  My approach is to write only about positive/neutral traits and not mention negatives.  If I get specific follow up questions about things I left out, then I feel obligated to mention the negatives.  You're right, it's not fun and it is hard, but try to balance being fair to your student with being fair to the potential employer.  2) tell your student what jobs they should be applying for and state tehy will not be competitive for others.  ",Because checking this wiki on a Sunday makes any sense.  ....yet I'm here. x3,"decline interview invitation? (I know I should be thankful for getting on-site interviews. Please don't blame/hate me). I would like to hear people's suggestions/experience about declining on-site interview invitation. I had skype interview with this institution before and I got a bad feeling about the department. Besides, I already have an offer from a place that my research fits better. Accordingly, I am thinking about declining the invitation. Is there any thing I should consider? Thank you for your input! 2) Keep it simple. Thank them for the invitation, but just say you've already accepted a position elsewhere. Wish them best in their hiring process and move on. Congrats on your offer! from #1.  I actually haven't decided if I will accept the offer as I still have some interviews. But my skype interview experience just made me want to decline for this specific institute. Maybe I will frame it as I already consider accepting offer etc. Thank you #2! 3) It can be very difficult to tell much from a Skype interview. I know several people who were sure they would hate a school only to get to an on campus interview and find they love it. I think there are lots of valid reasons for turning down an on-campus interview, but a bad skype interview seems surmountable. Of course, none of use were on the skype call, but it may be worth going in with an open mind. If you do accept the other offer, you can always back out later. And congrats! 4) If going to the on-site doesn't affect your offer at all (won't have to keep that school waiting past their deadline), you might be more informed by going to the on-site interview. The con is that you might waste your time, but the pro is that you may learn something you didn't know beforehand that would affect how you decide (and might snag some nice dinners). Hope it works out well for you. 5) I agree with #2, thank them and tell them you have other offer that you are likely to accept. 6) Voicing my agreement with 3 and 4. The interview could go well and change your mind, or not. Worst case is you meet a bunch of new people (and might snag some nice dinners). 7) If you REALLY don't think it would be a good fit, cordially decline the interview. The SC would much rather not waste a whole lot of time and $$$ on someone who isn't interested. It would also open a slot for other candidates. If you think there is even a small chance you would take the offer if made, there are a lot of reasons to do the interview. Most notably, if you have multiple offers, you have a LOT more negotiating leverage. X2 8) 2 is right. Simply and politely decline, it really is that simple. 9) Coming from the other side, I only had a skype interview for my current position, and it went really well, I accepted the position, started, and found myself on a steadily emotionally and mentally draining decline because of my new co-workers and departmental environment. I would have loved to have an on-site interview to uncover this. The opposite may occur for you! 10) #9, you must be a superstar for them to offer you a position without an onsite... 11) Some places do final round interviews remotely for budget reasons, especially if you're far away. 12) #9 here...superstar, ha! See reasons listed by #11 and also that it was *not* for a tenure track position. from #OP. Thanks everyone for the inputs! I just declined the invitation - I don't think I will fit well and this could open up a slot for someone that fits better. Another reason I declined - I felt very uncomfortable during the skype interview (see venting 1/11/2018). This is the first time I ever experienced this. My oral and dissertation committee were all from the same gender, but I never felt the same way I felt during the skype interview. I may be too sensitive, but that is how I felt.... 13) I agree with you. This is a life change, you shouldn't take a job that makes you uncomfortable. Going to an interview is always stressful and time-consuming. If you already have other opportunities, just stay home and enjoy your life during that days 14) at the risk of sounding greedy, I agree with #7 - shouldn't everyone's goal here be to receive MULTIPLE offers? That puts you in a better place to negotiate (it's a numbers game for everyone). I see you declined the interview - a tough decision and likely the right one for you - but you could have used any offer to potentially sweeten any other deal. 15) If you know you are never going to take a job, please do not go for an on campus interview.  On-campus interviews are a HUGE time commitment for faculty/grad students in the department.  If you are on the fence, go.  If not, please let the department/search committee invest their time in candidates who are considering the job.  Note - if word gets out that you were never going to take the job it will follow you.","generally, fml 2) Same.

I am starting to contemplate applying for more Non-TT visiting positions to give myself another season at it, but at 37, also hoping to have a baby sooner rather than later. It seems like visiting positions tend not to include parental leave like you might see in TT positions, but its hard to find this information without going through the whole interview process. Does anyone have any data/specific cases of parental leave policies for visiting positions? 2) Forget taking another temporary job. Leave academics, make a salary you deserve, and work a healthy amount of hours to leave plenty of time to focus on your family. 3) I;m sure OP knows what he/she wants. I'm 35 and just got a TT job after years of temporary stuff and a 4 year postdoc. 4) Had a friend who had their first child while doing a postdoc and it seemed to go relatively okay.

I am currently ABD and looking to stay in academia (applying for postdoc and faculty positions). What advice do you have? Thanks! 2) I always used my current universities letterhead. I got interviews and a job as an ABD. 3) Me too (about the letterhead not job) 4) I've always been told to use letterhead and that is what I've always done. Its hard to imagine the letterhead you use having a major effect on a search committee though (I guess if you are at a super fancy place the letterhead shows that off, but you can see that in the CV anyway). 5) First year I used letterhead, no interviews. Second year I used letterhead, 2 capus interviews and 0 offers. Third year I didn't used letterhead, 5 interviews 1 offer. Not sure it matters at all. 6) To generalize, I typically see US candidates using letterhead and non-US candidates refraining from using it. It's just a cultural thing (like photos on a CV) that makes no real difference to evaluators. 7) Like everything else, it just depends on who is on the search committee. I had a search committe chair who I know tell me that where the letterhead was from caught the eye and gave some applications more weight. I personally don't like that, but it happens. I use letterhead and would suggest it, merely because I doubt it ever hurts and there's a chance it will help in some searches. Edit: my only experience is with US searches. 8) I always thought the convention in the US is to use letterhead, but in Europe you're not supposed to. In fact, some UK applications expect you to put your cover letter in a text box."
"Do rejection emails cost money? So, after not hearing anything about a search (after 2 months), I e-mail the SCC.  No answer.  OK, I get it that you won't hire me, but is your time so precious that you can't send a fucking rejection email? 1) Frankly, that's why I really appreciate having this wiki so we can find out news - otherwise you just wait and wait with no contact from the SC's. It is unfortunate, and I really wish SC's and all applicants would update the wiki as they learn information to help improve the overall communication and information. It is really hard for people not to hear anything back. 

2) I couldn't agree more with you #1. And then there are those SC's who first don't bother to contact you and when you finally muster up the courage to nudge them, they're as vague as a politician at a psychic fair. I think if you've interviewed, you deserve the straight dope (in a TIMELY MANNER)! 
3) #2 again here. I also want to say that it's not only vexing to those in post-interview limbo to wait, wait, and wait without a clue from the sc but, it's also damaging to the overall sense of confidence in the department that we interviewees may potentially join. Granted, those waiting are probably not the 1st choice of the SC and are probably in limbo because the position was offered and they're in negotiations or tied up in higher up red tape. But, top candidates sometimes decline and, sc's make offers to the runner-ups. Thus, it's in both, the stand-bys' and department's, best interest to keep the ""sense of confidence"" in the department up by giving them the straight dope in a timely manner and not just ignoring them for WEEKS. Otherwise, you have a handful of stressed-out, unproductive (see Wiki is Crack post below), disgruntled candidates bitching out sc's (and each other) on here.
4) I'm in the same boat, OP. It sucks! and there's NOTHING we can do about it and, that sucks even more.
(5) But what can you do when you have 3-4 candidates spread out over 3-4 weeks, with another week trying to get the faculty together to vote? That's 4 weeks of waiting after the interview right there for the 1st candidate. That doesn't even include offer wrangling if you are not the first choice. How can they tactfully explain you are not their first choice, and still keep you in reserve in case the #1 flakes or declines? Two months is totally bogus though, move on unless you're getting a masseuse and a corner office/lab. Don't let it fester, you can see what it does to people with a quick look on this board. It's becoming a canabalistic clusterfuck. 

6) First off, love the vernacular #5 in your last sentence. Classic and totally appropos. (I'm serious!) I have nothing to add other than it could be worse. My friend was a VAP whose line opened up for TT. He interviewed and after the last interview, no one would talk to him or make eye contact for 3 weeks. AWKWARD! Turns out candidate #1 declined, and he was ecstatic to be candidate #2. But those few weeks were the worst for him and no one in the department would dare tell him what was going on. But you're right, it sucks. 
(7) I know waiting is anguish but you have to realize a lot of this comes down the University HR department.  (8) i can understand when at the offer stage, but why not post as soon as  phone interviews and campus interviews have been scheduled?  what's the secret? (9) Some places are not allowed to - this is an HR decision.
(10)  OP here - even if they cannot officially reject anybody, why is it so difficult to respond to an inquiry email with a simple:  ""we're interviewing candidates, we'll notify everybody when we make a decision""?  Moreover, it seems like the smaller places that have fewer applicants do this more often - Bryant and Fordham, to name two that never even bothered to send out rejection notices after they made their hires, much less respond to emails.

(11) University of Toronto took 3 months from the time the offer was made to inform candidates that they were no longer being considered. I like the schools that inform candidates right away when they didn't make the shortlist. I don't mind waiting when I'm in the final group of 10 or whatever the long list is. You know the SC is not going to move down the list to # 11 and beyond so why not just inform those folks from the get-go? But, then again, like applying for grants, I just assume I won't get the job/grant and carry on with life. If I do hear some good news, well then it's good news. No point in losing sleep over each application that seems to disappear into the academic black hole. And I too appreciate all of those that update the wiki - it sure is a lot more informative than waiting for SCs to send out rejection emails.","Can you research your way out of a job? I'm posting here because the venting page is evolving into an even more unpleasant place. I hope that this discussion can remain civil, and that criticisms are constructive. I pose this question because I am doing a postdoc in a M/L institution that is a teach first environment, with the teacher-scholar model. Teaching loads are light enough that faculty are able to still do some really good research (the reason I have a postdoc here!). In having been here a while, I've found that I really like this environment. I have targeted jobs that are similar instead of shooting for R1/R2s. My background is that I have a pretty strong research record but also 2 teaching awards. I recently interviewed at a school that also uses the teacher-scholar model and has pretty good teaching loads, but no MS program. The upside is that undergrad research is great! I felt I could still do good research there and would have been happy with an offer. I didn't get the offer, either because 1) I didn't have a good interview, 2) I just wasn't the right fit, or 3) other. 1 and/or 2 are entirely possible, so I'm not complaining about not getting the job. That's the way the ball bounces. But I'm curious about the 3rd option: if there are any SCs lurking here, do you feel that someone with a strong research record (and strong desire to continue their research line) who applies to a teacher-scholar model faculty is by definition a ""bad fit?"" 1) Long time lurker, first time poster. Another upside is that there are far more opportunities at schools like that...many more SLACs than R1's. I'll wait offline for the venomous/juvenile comments. Thank you. 2) Number 1 is totally correct, more opportunities and in many cases really excellent opportunities. I don't think being a strong researcher will count against you at most schools that also make a priority of undergrad research (which is true of many slac and M/L schools). Explain how you'll fit in your cover letter and if interviewed explain how you'll integrate undergrads into your research and they'll probably love you! OP it didn't work out this time but keep doing what you're doing and it's likely you'll find the right fit. Good luck! 3) I was wondering the same thing about a recent interview, especially since I don't have any teaching awards like you and am in a research postdoc. I think if I continue to go for jobs like this I will try to get more teaching experience. One thing that bugs me about this size of school, though, is the lack of equipment and start-up funding. It's hard to get undergrads involved in your research when you are writing grants to get the equipment you need while teaching new classes. I also thought the SC might have selected another candidate who didn't express a need for any equipment. My needs are relatively modest but I'm realistic about what it will take to hit the ground running. (4) I tried to think of a venomous/ juvenile comment, but I hit my quota on the venting page ;) I'll have to try to be constructive instead. As the previous posters have said, it's all about how you spin yourself. I wasn't in a postdoc, but my grad school was very research-oriented and my research area was nowhere near what the job I was applying for wanted taught. But, I had some experience teaching that, worked in some talk about undergrad research, didn't need much start-up (which may be a real problem depending on your research area), and really fit socially with the dept. So, I got the job. The key, though, is not just to talk the talk. I think they can tell if you are blowing smoke about being happy doing mostly teaching, and if they can't tell, it will become obvious soon. I don't think having a strong research record is a deal-breaker if you can prioritize it properly and be honest while doing so. Good luck! 5) #1 here, #4- Very refreshing and excellent advice, I think that's what we're supposed to be about here. Thank you. 
6) OP here - I appreciate the professionalism and comments. I made specific mention in the last 3 minutes of my seminar on how undergraduates fit into my research plan, even outlining the specific projects they could start working on right away. In the lunch with students after my talk, they commented that was the part they liked best was how I explicitly described how they could fit into my lab. So I think I did well on that part. But I remember a couple of comments to the effect of ""what we want to avoid is someone who is shooting for R1/R2 and using us as their fallback option."" I'm not sure how else I could have conveyed my genuine excitement to land this job. In retrospect, something that probably contributed to me not getting the offer is that they were very clear with their teaching expectations, so I had very few questions about teaching. They were very vague with their description of research expectations and practicality, so most of my questions were on that. I'm sure it appeared that all I really cared about was the research, but it was more of a component of the fact that I knew 100% what I was getting into with teaching. I guess I should have talked more about teaching and pretended to have lots of other questions about it even when I didn't. Live and learn. Maybe that hurt me a bit, or maybe I'm just an a-hole, didn't fit in, and blew my interview...which is entirely possible, too! :) (7) OP, you don't sound like an a-hole! :-)
8)  OP, I'm also sure that you're not an a-hole, and I would also be willing to bet that nothing specific in your interview was to blame for your rejection.  As in many of these cases, you must remember that there are three interviewees, and only one job.  It could just have well been that one more person in the department felt that they could collaborate with the person who got the offer, or that he/she would teach one more course that they need taught, than you could.  From what I've seen, it is really usually about ""fit"".  You are a perfectly good, no, let me say, excellent, researcher and teacher, but you don't fit the perceived hole in that department as well as somebody else.  I was rejected from a job last year, in favor of a person with fewer publications, and much less teaching experience.  However, he could teach Anatomy and Physiology.

Montana State University recently fired one of its professors without cause and the university's position, as quoted in a recent newspaper article is: ""Assistant professors are hired on one-year contracts. The university has the right to non-renew any of those contracts without having to give any reason."" Link to the article: http://tinyurl.com/zdcl4jg 2) This is true of the university I'm a VAP at - our contracts are renewed in the summer. I think certain state laws mandate this? 3) The events in that story seem very unusual. I'm not sure exactly what grouds asssistant profs can be terminated under in most cases, but the only times I've really heard of this happening are at the stage of very negative third year reviews or upon being denied tenure. For VAPs the story is different of course. 4) 2 here again - to be clear, it's the same policy for all non-tenured faculty, so regular assistant profs can have their contracts not-renewed as well. I just happen to know mine won't be renewed at a certain point  5) Most senate faculty have a document that covers grounds for non-promotion and termination.  Almost every school has a formal appeal process.  Find that document.  It's there to protect you. 6) I'm an AP at a SLAC and we are on 2-year contracts before tenure. 7) At some universities, all employees are technically annual employees. That's the case at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, although I don't think it means anything different in terms of the tenure process. Some state schools are bound to decisions from the state legislature, but that doesn't necessarily mean anything is different in practical terms. 8) Re: #7; it makes things different in practical terms when the university starts using that policy to get rid of professors outside of the general rules of retention/tenure and misconduct (as in Montana State University's case).  9)  it is normal and widespread.  Many schools advertise tenure-track vacancies knowing well and good the person is to be cut and never make tenure.  The only difference between a TT AP and a VAP is that one has the possiblity (maybe) of making tenure.  Until you are tenured, you are at-will, especially in right-to-work states.","Jesus people, please do not delete others comments. When you fix cells from version history, do not delete newer comments. x2 2) Why are you just blaming Jesus people for this?

Hire postdocs and research assistants, FFS.  Don't train 20 PhD students who are all just waiting for you to die so they have a shot at the one faculty job that they might actually be qualified to hold. 8) Faculty should tell prospective students ""sorry, you want to have a career in science but I'm going to make the decision for you and not let you do research with me?"" 9) How about something a little more reasonable, #8, like training your grad students to do something other than research and write grants and papers? For example, place value on quality teaching and help them gain real teaching experience (not just TAships). And encourage them to think outside the box a bit in terms of career goals. I was trained to be a researcher at an R1 despite the fact that I'm not at all interested in playing that role. 10) Not advocating this, but limiting (to one degree or another) your lab to MS and postdocs doesn't reduce the number of people in science, but it does keep PhDs without homes afloat and lets post-grads do work in their field that can lead more easily to a job. I don't think it's common practice, but it's also not turning anyone away. 11) I don't dispute that PhD students should be exposed to more skills and options other than R1 tenure-track jobs, but #7 was advocating turning off the PhD glut (ie denying opportunities to others, ie pulling up the ladder). 12) I know at least one lab where there's a concious effort to reduce (not eliminate) PhDs in favor of MS students and postdocs. It doesn't reduce the number of people involved in science, and MS students coming out of there do sometimes go on for a PhD elsewhere, so it's struck me as a fairly decent thing to do. 13) MS programs are often worse than PhDs in terms of financial support and resources though (less scholarship and funding available, students more likely to be paying tuition). Of course they are a lot shorter so at least students aren't waiting 6-8 years before realizing they won't be able to get a job. 14) None of the MS students I've known (or been) at PhD-granting institutions have had to pay tuition, and their job prospects have been better. 15) Ditto #14 - I was surprised by how many options there were when I finished my MS and now advise my students to seriously consider the MS route prior to or instead of moving on.  16) #11, you are not ""denying opportunity to others"" by not taking on PhD students as a PI if there are in fact almost no job opportunities for people with a PhD.  And if you are instead using your funding to create long-term opportunities for postdocs and research assistants, then you are not ""pulling up the ladder""... You're helping people who are already trapped in this unfair system.  Yours is an asinine statement. 17) #16 Happy Holidays to you too. There are job opportunities for people with PhDs. People are getting hired. So, yes if I told people that want to work with me on their PhDs that ""no, sorry I'm not doing that anymore because it is hard to find an academic or agency job after a PhD"", then yes I'd be denying them an opportunity. For the record I've had 3 PhD students graduate from my lab. 1 has a permanent job and 2 have post-docs. People seem so focused on their own situations that they are advocating closing off options for others.","Visiting assistant professorships: career building for position at SLAC, or scam? There's a VAP position that is, well, perfect for me. If it were tenure track, I'd apply in a heart beat and have a good chance of getting it. However, since its probably a sabbatical replacement, doesn't seem like there's much likelihood of it turning into a more long-term position. So, do I go for it? Its a reasonable teaching load, and could be very good experience, but I don't want to get stuck in non-TT purgatory.  2) Obviously take it.  Especially if you can get some manuscripts out during that year (are you sitting on any that can be shelved or tinkered with until then?) so you show you can teach and do research at the same time. 3) Based purely on my anectdotal tracking of jobs that I've applied for over the last 3-4 years, a LOT of people who get hired at SLACs have previously been VAPs at other SLACs. Particularly if the only thing limiting your applications at SLACs is a lack of teaching experience, it seems like a good VAP can make a huge difference. 4) Some of you will hate this...but some SLACs only hire non-tenure track positions. It's almost like pre-, pre-tenure. They want to see you get your feet wet before they offer you a tenure-track job. I'm not saying that the school you are thinking about uses this methology, but I know two SLACs where this is the only way they will hire. 5) On the other hand, all of the SLAC's I applied to this year filled their positions with people doing non-teaching postdocs who hadn't been VAPs anywhere previously (thank you network for telling me who got jobs + google for stalking people's CVs)... this including when VAP's were part of the on-site interview pool","When you get a personal e-mail from search committee to apply for a position... and then don't make the Skype list! 2) Ugh that SUCKS 3) Happened to me last year... broke my heart. 4) THis process is the worst. I'm so sorry. 5) #1 here: Thanks for the support! I don't know anyone in this Dept (directly or indirectly) so was flattered they approached me... guess they found everyone else too! And I was a good fit too. Blah! 6) Don't worry. It happened several times with me. I think they sometimes target random people to increase the pool as well as check off some boxes to advance their pre-selected candidate. So, I don't get into that trap anymore. These faculties are in another level, biased, and corrupted in mind. 7) not saying bias doesn't exist, but this situation hardly seems to be evidence of bias.  Searches are complex and individual faculty in a recruiting department are encouraged to spread the word about a job and encourage friends, colleagues, and others to apply for a position.  This often results in individual emails being sent - in a department of ~20 faculty where each person sends an average of one individual email the result will be more individual solicitations than can be included on a skype/phone interview list.  And one person's ideal candidate, targetted with an encouraging email, may not be palatable to the SC or the rest of the department for reasons including, but certainly not limited to, bias and corruption. 8) # 6 here responding to # 7. Not only that it happened to me multiple times that chair asked me to apply but ended up not offering for even a phone call. It also happened me several times, that I pre-inquired about an advertised position sending my CV, and asked their opinion regarding my chances. Each single time chairs told me that they were looking for someone exactly having my credentials, but each time ended up without any interview. Sorry, butenough of this BS for me. 9) #8, are you a from a minority race or a woman? Just curious. 10) 6/8 - I honestly think you're being a bit oversensitive. I've emailed committees (including *people I know* on said committees) to ask about my chances, been encouraged to apply, and then had no phone call. Unless you're drastically out-of-field, I find it unlikely they're ever going to outright discourage an applicant. Imagine the discrimination accusations THAT could open them up to? 11) #8 here responding to #9: Yes, I am. And in response to #10: I'm not only talking about just ""encouragement"", that's quite understandable. But a number of times search chairs directly told me that they were exactly looking for someone with your background, and experience (example): ""Impressive CV.  Yes, your background would fit very well with us. Please apply!"" That ""impressive CV"" resulted in not even a phone interview. 12) But where is the racial or sexist bias coming into this? I agree with #10 that the chair is likely just being overly nice or optimistic, and is not going to actively discourage anybody from applying. And if they were just trying to pad their diversity numbers, that would only work if they actually give you a phone interview. It would be pretty stupid for a SC to systematically encourage minorities to apply, and then also systematically not interview them. I know some minority applicants on this site have complained that they tend to get phone interviews, but never on-campus interviews, which I can see as something nefarious. I'm not really seeing it in your case though. 13) Here we go...x7 14) #8 = #11 here to respond #12. Hope by now you realized that we're not stupid, and no matter how you hide your bias, it's gonna come out each time you ""don't see"" something obvious. Now, in contrary to some of you, I also received negative feedback from search chair directly discouraging me to apply, so the notion that search chairs don't do that is just wrong. Here is his response to my inquiry: ""Thanks for your email. We are still accepting applicants. However, if you don't have experience with XXX or YYY I think you would not be very competitive. We are really looking for someone with experience to hit the ground running."". 15) https://facultydevelopment.stanford.edu/recruitment/search-committee-resources/searching-candidates . For some universities, HR would require you to have a diverse applicant pool. Doesn't mean that the eventual hire is someone who is a minority or a woman. That's why some folks are being invited to apply for a position. 16) I got an email from the chair of a current search that btw I'm very excited about. I told my advisor and they told me ""don't get too excited, it doesn't mean anything, this type of ""invitations"" are sent very often"". They also told me that the chair was maybe compliying with HR 17) #12 again. First of all, I don't see how I was implying anybody was stupid, and I also don't know what bias exactly you think I was trying to hide. I'm also in no way trying to say that women or minorities don't have a harder time in academia. They obviously do. But in this specific case, I am honestly not seeing the 'obvious' discrimination you refer to. Being encouraged to apply for a position and then not getting an interview is not evidence of bias. For example, I was recently encouraged to apply for a position by someone in a department whom I know very well, and have worked with them extensively. Yet in the end, I recieved no phone interview, and have not heard anything from this colleague personally either. I think this type of situation is very common for everybody on here. The whole point of this page is that we are all 'venting' about how much this process sucks, and how utterly random and impersonal it can be. Again, I am not at all trying to imply that there are not real biases in searches, I just honestly am not seeing it in this case. If I'm missing something though, I would be open to hearing more about your take on it. 18) #1 again. I just wanted to vent! 19) to #17, you are encouraged once or twice to apply for a position, and this is very common because as you said, you have some connections with them. Imagine you are a woman or a minority in STEM, and you get invited to submit applications to dozens of openings, just so that the search committee can tick a box that HR wanted, and have no chance in getting the job. If you look at various HR sites, the box they want ticked is ""DIVERSITY in application pool"", not hiring a diverse candidate. x2","Powerpoints in skype interviews Do any of you prepare powerpoints to show to the committee during zoom / skype interviews?

I was there for like four hours. Gave a talk, had a few meetings, got a campust our. Much less intense than typical TT interviews. 3) I agree with #2 that my non-TT interviews were all not too intense, while my TT interviews have run the gamut from chill to harsh. But, for me these non-TT interviews were all one day and so the schedules ended up being  pretty full. If that's the case for you then expect to maybe start lagging a bit by the end if you're not use to talking for 6+ hours straight. 4) Mine was a full day interview, plus a dinner with the SC the previous night and dinner with grad students that day. Given that you'll (likely) be covering courses and working with students, be prepared to discuss your capacity to jump in on teaching (pedagogy, disciplinary expertise) and student needs in the department. I treated it as a dry run for potential future TT interviews, tailoring specific questions for specific people (deans, program heads, disciplinary colleagues, students). 5) Thanks everyone for the feedback!

Just enjoy the tour - it will give you some idea what the area is like. 7) A lot of places do real estate tours if they are in an area where they think candidates will be worried about being able to find suitable housing (price, family friendly, etc). Seems weird to do that for a VAP though. I'd just treat it as a break from the formal interview and get a chance to see what the area looks like. 7) Thanks everyone! 8) Real estate agents are notorious for asking inappropriate questions in terms of interviews (kids?, church?) and sometimes ""innocently"" communicating that back to the department. Just be aware. 9) 8 - how do you recommend navigating potentially inappropriate questions in this type of situation?"
"Declined offers WITHOUT the potential to remain where you are I'm curious how many of us have declined offers without having job security.

I posted a blog from Washington U in st. Louis that talked about why search committees take so long.  It was mostly BS, so i responded as much! Maybe that is the way it DOES work at WUSTL, but most places don't spend 6 weeks coming up with a short list.  In fact, at most average universities the faculty can cut half the people out of the list in about 20 minutes.  Why?  Because half the people in the pile don't even meet the required need.  After that has been done, all the faculty do is place a rubric next to them rating each factor for each candidate from 1-5.  The prof has too many other things to do, so he/she rapidly tears through each portfolio and rates the content for each factor.  This takes about an hour to 3 hrs, though usually closer to the low end.  then, the committee meets for an hour and discusses the top say 15 candidates.  Some people change their scores after realizing they missed item A on page 3, or a remark on letter 2 demonstrated this candidate was a star or washout. Then, the committee chair sends the materials to the Dean or HR or whatever is the procedure.  So, the faculty spend maybe two days on the portfolio, the HR spends a week or two to get back, dean spends a few days to a week to approve spending money on phone interviews.  Then, they invite phone interviews.  After the phone interviews, the members rate each candidate by a rubric and now they have it down to the top 1-2.  This list goes to the Dean, who approves spending $ to bring in these candidates.  Some schools only invite top candidate, interview, if satisfied, hired.  The stage between the campus interview and offer is what takes the longest.  The early stages, like making a short list can take a day.  Why does it really take so long to get a short list together?  because faculty put it off as they deal with other things on their plate. THAT is why it takes so long, and it is also a very legitimate reason.  People are busy.","I fucking hate that SCs won't let you know when someone has accepted or at least has been offered the job.

I'm afraid of asking for too much, but also of asking for less than I could have gotten. 2) Take this for what it's worth, but I think it is always best to ask for what you think you really need to do the job and accomplish the vision you have for it.

Might be worth reaching out to them to ask.    3) They usually have a way to grant you PI status.  You might need a ""courtesy appointment"" until you start.   The worst part is filling out compliance and ethics training when you aren't a normal employee.   There is a way to make it work.   It will just take more effort from sponsored projects and your dept head.  4) Our institution and sponsored program office will work with newly hired faculty to get them PI status in situations like this. Especially if it's a larger institution, they've likely seen this before, and will be able to help you out. And congrats on the job!","I just had a Skype interview at an R1 university and have gotten so used to interviewing with smaller teaching-focused schools that I totally forgot to sufficiently research potential collaborations. I had one person in mind, but they were looking for multiple and cross-disciplinary and I just had to say that's all I got. Shit, I'm an idiot, really kicking myself. 2) Don't sweat it. Search committee members mostly don't want applicants to identify people at the hiring institution with whom they'd hope to collaborate: https://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2018/07/24/how-much-do-you-and-should-you-tailor-your-ecology-faculty-job-application-to-the-hiring-institution-poll-results-and-commentary/ 3) yeah but if they specifically ask you in a skype interview that's a little different. 4) First, congratz! Second, don't worry about it. The SC looks at a number of things, so it'd be an overall evaluation of your application packet. This is coming from an applicant who did tens of these skype/phone faculty interviews. 5) I think OP is fine, but that poll is of 35 self-selected respondents. Shouldn't be used as a reference for concrete statements. 6) When I got asked that question I usually prefaced it with that I care a lot about collaborating with people who I get along with/who play well with others, so that it was hard to identify people if I'd never met them, but then mention a couple of names or disciplines that I was interested in (e.g., I'd love to meet a microbial ecologist who I could collaborate with, or I'm interested in person X in dept X)","Just curious  How often do you check this wiki? 1) There's a correlation with the level of anxiety I'm experiencing and the times I check it. I think this week I've checked like five times per day but before maybe once per day or less 2) Hahahaha I hear what you are saying, I cruise this and the chronicle of higher ed forums, usually at lunchtime then again in the evening if there's any noticeable activity on my job apps 3) Now that the big push of positions have already passed the initital interview stage I check this once in the afternoon after most emails from departments would have gone out. I figure if I made the cut I would have an email in my inbox, if I don't make the cut, I prefer to get the news at the end of the workday by checking this wiki after 5 pm EST so I can go home and forget about it. 4) Once a day, though  I guess this is #2 today... 5) Once or twice a day, on average.",NA,"What do you talk to HR about during interview/before an offer? I have an on-campus interview at a SLAC at the end of this month. They've put me in contact with the usual cast of characters (SC, admin assit to arrange travel) and also an HR rep ""to answer any questions I might have"". I know you're supposed to wait until getting an offer to go over benefits and salary, so what am I supposed to be asking HR about at this point? I don't want to ignore the HR rep and look uninterested, but I'm stumped as to what would be ""good"" questions at this point. 2) I think this part of your interview is the last thing you should be worried about. I have found this meeting to sometimes be awkward if you have a 30 minute time slot with not much to talk about. But I've also found that the HR person usually just gives their standard spiel to you. I think its fully appropraite to talk about things like healthcare and retirement here, but probably not salary or start-up costs, etc.3) agree with 2. I had a meeting with an HR rep at one of my interviews last year. Basically just told me about health/retirement benefits. I also used it as a chance to ask what they thought of living in the area and working at the university. Among the people you meet with, they might give the most honest answer. 4) Pretty standardized meetings, stereotypically. Will probably give you a folder filled with benefits information and then try to give you a quick summary of the info while you are too overwhelmed to think about retirement and healthcare. I suggest nodding your head positively and saying, ""sounds great."" Take the folder home and really take a good look at the benefits b/c they might not be as good as the HR rep summarized to you enthusiastically. I've been given housing information at the HR meetings before, as well. On one occasion, I did get some very specific questions from HR that really threw me off; e.g., ""What do you do if a student comes to you and says they are having suicidal thoughts?"" I later found out that the suicide rate was wayyyyy higher than average on that campus. After I met with the first HR person that asked the questions about suicide, I then met with a diversity rep in HR, and she asked me diversity questions; e.g., ""How will I increase involvement of minority students in STEM."" I'm not really sure how my answers to questions like those played into the hiring process, as at my current university we never communicate with HR about making hiring decisions. Either way, I didn't get the job, so I guess I will never know. 5) Near the end of a recent Skype interview, the HR person asked me a couple of questions like ""what kind of colleague are you?"", ""are you a person that people often come to for help?"", and ""what's that on the wall behind you?"" (my mistake for having a blackboard slightly visible). I rambled a bit but didn't ask her anything. Got the job. Don't think these questions mattered much as long as I didn't reveal myself to be a jerk."
"Declined Offers I'm just curious here. I'd like to know how many of us so far, have received offers and declined them. I would also like to ask why you declined?  It seems that even in this shitty job market that folks are still declining. 
 I just declined an offer.  Aside from geographic factors, one major issue for me was that the start up was not sufficient enough to eventually produce work that would attract funding in a department that was clearly unsupportive  or detached from organismal/eco/evo work. I figured that if I were to accept the position I would need buku start up dinero to make it work (to land a major grant, attract top students, etc. ).  So I declined. I'm still waiting to hear back from others and am quite happy in my post doc.  Declined Offers: N=10
(1) Declined 3 offers and several interviews - one place had little research support, the other two were absolutely perfect, but alas I could only take one job. I picked based on location, offer for spouse, and my interactions with the faculty. PS: Why am I still trolling the wiki?!?
(2) I had three interviews scheduled, and the first place offered the job before I even went to interviews 2 & 3. The offer didn't meet my minimum needs and refused to wait even a week for an answer, so I declined. Interview #2 went well, #3 still in the future, my fingers are crossed... I decided it was best to take my chances because my current research position is secure for next year.
(3) I declined an offer from a SLAC as my VAP position at my current SLAC will continue for a couple more years and the job involved teaching courses I didn't want to teach, not much of a culture of research/publishing (not required for tenure), and small/poor quality lab space.
OP again, thanks for the response so far. Related to my original post, I'm curious as to how many TT faculty are on here looking for greener pastures? Regrets? Why? Thanks!

It should have been posted pre-deadline if you wanted more updates/info  3) Not the OP here - instead of scolding provide info if you have it, otherwise ignore.

Lame. 2) A few places to which I've applied state that applicants won't receive further contact unless they're selected for an interview, etc. A little awkward, I agree. 3) I never got contacted last year by a job that I had an on-site interview for! 4) I'm not sure such a courtesy has ever existed in the first place.

I have read that it's best to provide a minimum needs list and an ultimate wish list, with the hopes that you'll get something in the middle.  I figured I'd include space needs, equipment, and supplies.  I'm not sure though how detailed I should go and how much should be completely priced out.  Also, should I include personnel?  How to deal with inevitable price increases that will inevitably occur between now and 2 years from now when I may actually be making purchases?  Does anyone have experience with this?  Does anyone know of a website with actual examples?2) Ask the search chair for an idea of target amounts. 3) All places I have interviewed thus far have suggested that, in the event of an offer, I obtain the start-up request from the most recent hire in the department and go from there. Once you receive an offer, they are on your side. It is just a matter of finding the right amount/equipment after that. And everyone I have spoken to have said to ask for what you would really love to have to get your research going. The money, though, should only last you 3-4 years... not the entire 6 years of pre-tenure. The startup lists I have received from various faculty members have all been similar (excel sheets with multiple tabs and the first being a summary of each category [travel, personnel, supplies/consummables, equipment]).

I am European, I earned my PhD in a very good University in Europe, worked as postodc and adjunct faculty for two years in Europe and then moved to U.S. for a 2.5 years postdoc in a very prestigious University. I have 25 papers, about half as first author, including a very good paper from my U.S. postdoc. My application materials were read and approved by my American postdoc P.I. and other people. I applied to more than 35 jobs in the last two years, without even getting a phone interview. This year I also applied to a place where I had a strong connection in the search commettee and didn't even make the long short list. Is it because I am European? Or maybe because despite the 25 papers I don't have a CELL-NATURE-SCIENCE one? Should I give up? 2) I'm sorry to hear that, it's a very competitive market and hard to pinpoint what's the reason. Maybe you could ask your strong connection in the search committee if they have any insight they could share? They'd be more indicated to have any actual informed opionion, since we don't have access to your application material. 3) One thing I've noticed with some people that seem very competitive on paper that don't get a lot of bites for interviews etc is that sometimes these people pitch themselves very narrowly. For example, one might say they work on microbiology of this one organism in this one ecosystem without making it clear if or how they'll crossover and collaborate with others in the department or translate their research to help teach broad coarse requirements for students.  I think the lack of clear connections with other areas of research and pitching oneself too narrowly is where I've seen some people fail to resonate with search committees. 4) Maybe you should expand your search. 35 jobs applications in 2 years is quite little compared to what most of us do here. I applied to around 100 jobs before i heard anything, and I don't think it is because you are European. 5) Number #1 here. Thank you all very much for your suggestions. I was also considering whether the fact that my american P.I. is a junior one (although a great one!) might have affected my chances of getting an interview. Moreover, I applied to different kind of institutions: SLAC, regional universities, good state universities and a couple of R1. Maybe I should focus on only one or two typologies? 6) I think you can apply to lots of different kinds of institutions, but make sure you tailor your application to different types.  You don't want to emphasize research if the main job is teaching and vice versa. 7) A clever man once told me: to any TT, between 80 and 300 people will apply. Half of these are simply not competitive and are quickly removed from the list. 50-100 candidates remain: out of these, there will be at least 5 superstars that interview everywhere they apply. The math is simple, besides the 5 superstars only ca. 10 spots are left for a long short list of people usually interviewed by phone, and between 45 and 90 equally competitive people ""fighting for the spot"". The odds of winning the fight are extremely low, and since you are not a superstar, you need somethin in order for the search commettee to give more attention to your applicaiton package: a phone call from your very important PI, or more in general strong connection with the Department where you are applying might certainly help. 8) So depressing. Hard to think there's hope with stories like this. Keep trying I guess. 9) ""A phone call from your very important PI""? Does that actually happen? You ask a reference to call the search committee and reccommend you? 10) # 7 here: Yes, that was actually a suggestion I received in a panel organized by my postdoc University: ""tips for landing an interview for a TT job"". They said: you may wanna make sure that your application package goes on top of the list and is actually read by the commettee"". 11) From my experience on the market I would say that it is very hard to get traction at a SLAC without showing that you've made a concerted effort to get some teaching experience beyond your PhD (I applied for many but never got an interview but got a good number of R2/R1 interviews - so if you've been mostly in research positions this will be a hard sell. Given the time since you've finished your PhD, many locations would hope to see some evidence that you can bring in money, so if you are in a position where you can put in proposals that will help. There is also a lot of luck involved - I've seen some strange hires because departments were looking for something that was actually different from the job ad. Good luck. 12) I can tell you this. I did two postdocs: my first postdoc mentor told me that when he was on the job market and he was super competitive (he had one Science and two Nature first author papers), he applied for 25 jobs and interviewed only in four institutions where he new somebody very well in the search commettee Similarly, my second postdoc advisor went on the marked with 1 Nature and 2 Cell papers, and he only applied in two places, where he had strong connections in the Department. Unfortunately it looks like what really matters is who you know rather than who you are. It is sad, but we have to acknoledge the truth. 13) I don't understand #12's conclusion.  If both PIs had multiple Science/Nature/Cell papers, then how do they know that they were hired because of who they knew rather than their top-tiered pubs? 14) I agree with 13. Not that connections can't help you, but I think it is a lot less important in most of EEB than this thread would lead you to believe. I have never heard of a PI calling a search committee; in fact, I think that this would be viewed pretty negatively in the departments I have been in. Maybe this is a bit different as you move more towards the micro/genetics/medical research field. Certainly I know many people who have gotten jobs (including at very good universities) with no previous connection or 'in' at those schools.15) #12 here: Note that I wrote that both of my advisors ONLY got interviews where they had connections and had ZERO interviews where they had not (despite the several high profile papers). Do you wanna pretend having connections is not a (almost essential) factor? Go for it... 16) I'm sure connections help in a lot of cases but I know many people who have gotten R1 jobs without any connections in the department. My experience aligns more with 12's story though because I have mostly advanced in searches (3/4 campus interviews) where one of my advisors or I know someone on the committee (and I do not have a Science or Nature paper). 17) Yeah, I'd dispute the general contention that ""connections"" matter a great deal - and they can even backfire. For instance, some SC members react negatively to attempts by prominent folk to intervene on behalf of their own former students. Furthermore, established people often write multiple letters for a given search, naturally inviting comparisons that are not always favorable. 18) I have 30 pubs as first author (some in very good journals, no science/nature), a clear, supported by many publications research project with potential, prestigious fellowship won, invited to present at seminar series multiple times, teaching, co-supervisor of multiple PhD students. In 5 years, I got exactly 1 phone interview, zero campus interviews even for positions for which I felt I was a ""perfect fit"". I could blame the academic world for not having received a single interview, but there are also things that I could have done differently (including taking a PhD in a different place, being born in a different country, choosing other labs et.). 19) #18 Are you American? Did you do your PhD in America? 20) I am the writer of 18, not American, I am now (self-sponsored) permanent resident in the US, I did my PhD in Europe. People are constantly and genuinely surprised that I could not land a job. It is more surprising to me that I could not land a single campus interview. I had my application package reviewed multiple times by prominent scientists. I am very surprised that other people I know were able to land job in top R1 institutions to be honest, so and so CVs, ok research, but probably ""right labs"" and right connections. I applied to some positions recently and I looked at the CV of some associate professors with a CV not even comparable to mine (and I am pretty hard in terms of judging myself). In part I am baffled, in part I made wrong strategic decisions years ago. I think it is very unlikely that things will change, I am very tired and frustrated by the process, and I will very likely leave academia for greener fields.","I wish I could start the weekend with a good news. A few hours before giving up and having a beer. 2) <- right there with you x 50 (well, just 1, but in spirit it's that much). 3) I thought 50 people +1'd beer","chalk talk? I have an on campus interview at an R2 university.  They want me to give a typical research seminar and then the next day I meet with the SC to do a 'chalk talk'.  What is a 'chalk talk'??  2) search Dynamic Ecology archives for ""chalk talk""-- they have some useful links 3) Email SC and ask them to clarify. I've never had to do one, but I've talked to faculty where I'm at about them and from what I can gather the expectations vary wildly from dept to dept and even among people on the SC. I think the general idea is for you to talk about your goals and outline the first grant/paper you are going to write when you get the job. But then again, every place is different so you should definitely ask for clarification. It won't hurt you to ask. 4) Usually the goals are to: more clearly outline your future research, explicitly talk about your initial grants and where they will be targeted, and be able to differentiate your future work from that of your previous mentors. Also be prepared to talk a bit about teaching, and the specific courses you could develop or what you would teach from what is currently offered. 5) Definately ask the SC about the format. They may want you to literally only use chalk, or they may allow powerpoint slides. Be ready to outline 2-3 major research foci/grants (questions, general approach) and how grad and undergrad students will be involved. Here is a nice blog post: https://sociobiology.wordpress.com/2017/03/07/why-are-chalk-talks-so-hard/   6) Ask your advisor and other PIs at your university for guidance.   They really should be able to answer that question and should have coached you by now. 6) I think #4 is spot on. That's what we expected when I was on a search committee. 7) I've given two chalk talks. Both were essentially me outlining the first big grant I would write at the Uni (which obviously correlates with your short/medium-term research plans). Powerpoint wasn't allowed. A key thing for me was to immediately write down the Big Three Questions (or however many Qs your grant would have) first on the board and then go back and go into more detail for each one. In my experience, they give you about 5-10 minutes to state your overall goal and then start interrupting, so get the main points out first and quickly, because you may not have time later. For both talks, it was definitely a discussion/Q&A period, not at all a presentation where I talked non-stop for 45 minutes. Of course your mileage may vary. And definitely definitely practice it at least a few times with colleagues (preferably outside of your research area). And yes, ask the SC for more clarification on what they expect.

Hope this won't happen again. 2) The inside candidate done it! 3) What job was it for? 4) How could someone provide false info? #1again) It is nothing too big of a deal and I should have toned it down. I commented for a job that I know someone is having an on-site interviewed (so bascially telling people the bad news....). Someone changed/deleted part of my comment to say it is about another job in the same department. The good thing is this won't influence anyone's chance of landing a good job.  If one thinks my comment is false, he/she could add a new comment, instead of modifying it. 5) LOLZ #2, nailed it","Straight to campus interviews It seems that the UC system has a propensity to go straight to campus interviews (know of at least 3 departments who do this).

Without systematically compiling data, I wouldn't trust any broad generalizations about the types of places that do or don't. 6) One of my applications did this, invited me on campus without a phone interview.

They might actually think its weird if you send them a list of general job questions prior to visiting. 3) Yeah, I was thinking more about questions pertaining to the interview, like what's the audience, culture, chalk talk expectations. 4) Don't feel obligated to ask questions before, but stuff like expected audience for the seminar and chalk-talk expectations are reasonable and useful questions, if they haven't gone over it with you already. 5) I don't think they are necessarily expecting you to ask questions about the interview. 5) If they haven't given you information about the seminar, I'd definitely email and ask about the seminar audiance and format. 7) Definitely ask about the chalk talk format and scope.

"complete rant Complete rant: my PhD adviser is known for being a hard-ass negotiator.  I know he renegotiated at his current institution (by getting outside offers after tenure, with no intention of leaving) and has helped post-docs in the lab get > salary and start-up.  I asked him for help negotiating and basically was told to take the salary offer and to hope for <80K in start-up (RU/H).  Does he a) either really hate me, b)think I am not worth any money to anyone, or c) just being sexist (all post-docs were men, I am not). He has really helped people figure this out (and pushed them to negotiate hard) so I am just baffled!  Augh! (1) Why not tell him you think you need more and ask for tips on how to get it? If he again suggests to accept a lower amount than you think you deserve, ask him why. (2) I really hope it's not c but you never know. another possibility is that he's concerned about the state of the market or aware of the freezes many places currently have in place and just thinks you can't get more given these factors. He may be right but that's what negotiation is for - to figure this out. Ask him for help as 1 suggested but also talk to other people - even people who aren't officially mentors can be really helpful with these steps, particularly talk to Asst profs you know as they may have the best info for the current environment. Good luck! (3) Maybe he's just being snobbish about the institution and thinks they can't provide any more than they have offered. Negotiate! And use the numbers on the wiki as a guide.","UTSA Job?

I don't understand sometimes how people manage to mess stuff up so badly.  I've also noticed that the formatting on the Vacancies page is constantly being shuffled and re-shuffled in different ways.  I wonder if we can't all agree on what format it should stay in, as it's a little frustrating.  I'd be happy either with putting the schools in order alphabetically or sorting them by the latest updates.  Either way is useful, but sometimes it's sorted in ways that make no logical sense. 2) By latested updates or due dates seem best (now that we are further along, the former may be better). It is relatively easy to search for individual schools using the search function. Thanks so much for the work you put into this resource! 3) Yes, by latest update makes the  most sense, I am interested in how quickly all searches are progressing not just the ones I applied to.  If people want to check on their favorite school, there is no need to alphabetize by school, just hit ""ctrl + F"" on your computer and then type the school name. 4) There should be some message saying DO NOT SORT COLUMNS; people can make a copy at any point and then do whatever they want with their copy without bothering other people using the wiki at that point.

Can anyone comment on whether or not it is worth anyone's time if an agnostic or athiest applied? Is an applicant really expect to go on at length about one's research philosophy which presumably includes ""faith"" in evidenced-based science then write about her faith in supernatural ""faith"" in the same application? 2) You might base your statement on your faith that the universe obeys knowable laws that can be discovered through objective observation and reasoning.  Or you could just laugh as this department consigns itself to irrelevance, and not bother applying. 3) Pepperdine is Christian, but not evangelical. So, it's faculty are free to believe in old earth, evolution, etc. The department head published in Evolution about ""ancient adaptive radiations."" There are plenty of Christian evolutionary biologists, including the current director of the NIH. It's just that not many of us are very vocal about it. But, yep, from what I've read, you're wasting your time applying if you can't demonstrate a Christian faith. 4) There is a bit of a difference between faith and acceptance of faith as being important in peoples lives. Worst you could do would simply be to articulate that you have respect for the idea of faith and that for many people. But as a ""scientist"" belief is not what this endeavor is about. Data is not about belief... 5) To the OP, I'm an agnostic non-theist, but I don't see the problem.  Look at their web page: The first thing the University says about itself is it is a Christian institution committed to academic excellence and Christian values.  It's a private university and they (and all institutions) have a right to hire according to their mission and values.  If you do not share those values, then do not apply.  It's very simple. 6) Well, in my opinion, there is a big difference between hiring based on mission/values and outright descrimination. What if the mission/values of a university barred hiring woman, blacks, latinos, LGBT, etc...? The way that this is still legal is that religious universities consider their hires as ""clergy"" (or at least that's the rationale in the latest supreme court opinion on this matter). I personally believe that these hiring requirements/restrictions are less about mission/values than religious universities trying to ""hire their own,"" or ""like-minded"" faculty. It amazes me that shit like this is happening in this day and age, and it angers me that less qualified candidates are getting jobs at places like this (while my own job search has been brutally difficult), although I wouldn't want to teach at Pepperdine or a similar University anyway, so I'm not losing sleep over this crap. 7) Agreed.  But where is the evidence of outright discrimination in what #1 posted, above?  In fact, even the OP jumps to the conclusion that they'll only hire Christians, when in fact all they're asking for is a statement of faith.  It is very common for Boards of Trustees to ask for this stuff, but when it comes down to the hiring decision, it rarely is a religious test.  It's just a way to make sure you'll fit in the campus climate.  And I think that's OK (at least in this case).  I'm sure that HBCUs, millitary schools, and service colleges (to name a few) have similar ways to assess if you agree with the institution's mission and values.  Yes, we're all academics, but one thing we often forget is that we actually work for someone, and we do have a responsibility (however slight) to work within their vision of what their instituion is and does. 8) Nothing to see here, folks.

Not sure what I'm more stressed about... the interview or Trump.,"unmarried ""spousal"" hire? I think I know the answer to this one, but I'm assuming negotiating a spousal hire if you're not legally married (but in a longterm, committed, cohabiting relationship, maybe even with child) is a nonstarter? 2) Nope. I have 2 colleagues (2 separate couples) in my department who were hired and negotiated positions for their partners without being married or having kids, so maybe it depends on the department (though it shouldn't), but there is definitely precedent for positions to unmarried partners. x2 3) I've seen this work in EEB departments. I've also seen faculty have the attitude of, ""if they're not willing to make a legal commitment (i.e., marriage), why should we commit to a tenure-track job?"" 4) That's exactly the kind of BS people bust out when they just don't want to hire someone in the first place. If it were their #1 choice they'd be all ""no need for them to be married"".  Anyhow, this is silly since like 40% of marriages end in divorce.  5) At one University it was the admins, not the dept, that wanted spousal to be spouses. The easy work around if you get pushback: that person is your fiancee.  This worked in three cases where they were going all in on the 'sanctity of marriage'.  6) to #4, I don't see there is a problem. What do you expect them to do? Hire a less qualified candidate and his/her girlfriend/boyfriend (you mentioned that they are fine for #1 choice)? 4) I'm describing tactics individual faculty members could use to argue against someone they personally don't want hired: ""oh, their partner wants a position, but they're not married; let's make an offer to my favorite candidate instead"".  The politics of hiring decisions can be ugly. 7) OP #6, agree. The politics can be ugly. 8) Last year, I found receptiveness to a ""spousal hire"" for my partner (boyfriend, not fiancee or husband, who is not in an Eco/Evo field) to differ by institution, with smaller private (R1) schools having more leeway/enthusiasm about finding him a position. One institution did say it would be easier if we were married because this would smooth hurdles higher up the administative food chain. In all cases, I felt the negotiation was being handled ""in good faith"" by people who wanted me to take the job and were interested in making the position as attractive for myself and my partner as possible.","Is it me, or has this job season really sucked? There are only a handful of positions for which i feel i would be actually suited, the rest are so specific or have an evolutionary/genomics focus. What happened to advertising broadly? 2) Advertise too broadly and you receive too many apps. And candidates with a genomics/genetics focus are in relatively high demand. So are microbiologists and people with experience teaching human anatomy and physio. Seems like those jobs are a dime a dozen. 3) I'm currently more depressed at the locations of jobs that I'm qualified for than the lack of positions 4) Agree with 4. This year has been OK for me in number of jobs I'm qualified for, but zero are in places where I would really like to live and a bunch are in places where I really do not want to live. 5) I agree with 5. 6) hahahahahaha! that made my day 7) I agree with 7 that SC want EVERYTHING in a candidate these days. 8) Curious as to geographic regions people would prefer - my impression is that this year's offerings are relatively well-distributed spatially.  Granted, discipline-specific offerings may be constraints for certain people but I was pleasantly surpised by what is on offer.  Disclosure: I have dragged myself far and wide over the years and may have recalibrated expectations in that time. 9) The south sucks. There, I said it. x4  10) Relativley few west coast jobs this year, seemed to me. x3 11) @9 Does it though? Does it really? 12) For me there were no jobs in northeast and lots of west coast jobs. I like the west coast, but all family is in northeast and with kids I really don't want to live that far from all of my family.  13) @11 I'll let you know after Alabama's upcoming election x2  14) There's no need to wait for the election. Moore will win. 71% of Alabama Republicans think the charges are false.  All the claims have done is mobilize his base to vote for him as a big ""F you"" to ""fake news"" CNN.  15) Ridiculous how we've come to a point in history where so many vote against their own interests simply to 'own those libs' 16) MOORE LOST!

Sigh. 2) I was told that last Fall. Still waiting 3) On the same boat. Had campus interview more than 2 weeks ago. Still no word yet! 4) to #3, for an on-campus interview, a 2-week wait is no big deal. Even if they're done all the interviews, there are multiple steps before anyone hears (committee meets and deliberates, writes a report, often full faculty vote (this varies by dept), chair then writes letter to dean/provost/etc, then waits for approval, only then can contact the first candidate) ","UK vs US jobs [Moved from #582] 2) I don't know the UK system, but is this the same as an assitant prof position, or is it a teaching position? 3) Lecturer (UK) = asst prof (US) 4) Also, this is not tenure-track, it is a permanent position. There is a probationary period of 5 years, but that is a formality in most UK universities, you need to do badly enough for them to kick you out. 5) @4 I'd say that's true at most US universities as well (source: faculty for 14 years now) 6) Thank you for the info. 7) They don't ask for teaching or research statements 8) No, just a covering letter and a CV. But if you haven't applied for a UK job before, find someone who knows the system and ask them about the covering letter... it will be far more detailed than a cover letter in the US. 9) Exactly. I have interviewed for multiple positions in the UK: cover letter (read person specification) is very important. 10) UK interviews are awesome. 20 minute talk, 20 minute interview, notification by the end of the day. 11) Do they fly you in for only a 40minutes interview? 12) Good universities do. You may have more interactions if you want (dinner with faculty, talks with people you choose, etc.) but the only thing that counts is the interview and the short talk. As an extreme example, I recently had a 30 minute Skype interview and they offered me the job based on that (I never went there). I declined the offer.13) Yes they do. I had 4 interviews in the UK (both in very good and in middle tier Unis) and they always flew me in from Philly.  14) Downside to UK jobs is that the startups are paltry to non-existent 15) How do you set up a lab without a startup? 16) They'll typically give you a small amount (< £50k) but expect you to apply for various competitive startup funds from the ERC, NERC, and Royal Society. 16) I was offered ~$40,000 and a PhD student. Plus most equipment is shared. PLEASE NOTE:  For lecturer position they do not have the expectation that you produce right away like it happens for tenure-track jobs in the U.S. The job is already permanent (probation period a formality). However, the most elite Unis (members of Russel group, equivalent ok American Ivy League) have recently started to hire folks via tenure-track systems (e.g. tenure track fellowships or tenure-track assistant professor positions) and in that case they give you a start-up but expectation is higher and tenure is not guaranteed. 17) Another main difference (and this explains the interviews being so short and that they tell you so quickly whether you got the job or not) is that all candidates normally interview the same day. You typically meet the other candidates, and go with them to whatever socials are organized. 18) Pro tip: if you are interviewing as an American in the UK, it looks very bad if you don't know about a) The Russell Group, and b) the REF.19) I have to say: I have done 4 on campus interviews in the UK this year and no one has asked me about the REF.  That being said, #18 is correct.  You need to know about it. 20) They won't ask you directly about it (too uncouth), but in some small way, all of the questions I've been asked by UK panels are relevant to it.",NA,"startup and requesting spousal accommodation For those that have negotiated positions with requests for spousal accommodation how much did your request for the accommodation influence how much you asked for in startup? Did you wait until you heard back on what the accommodation would be before submitting startup list? I want to reasonable with my requests, but I also don't want to take too little to do cool science.   2) You are supposed to be independent people who each have successful careers. In practice it can put a strain on budgets to find an extra startup unless the uni has a supplementary fund for that.  Send the list you would give to any other school.  Be prepared for them to be a little tighter than they might be otherwise.   Emphasizing research equipment and travel funds instead of viaing for even more summer salary support could help a little.   If they really love you and think you have potential they will go to the admins to make the case that you are a great hire that deserves all the support you can get.   I hope you are negotiating with a good dept chair. 3) Thanks for background and support 2. i hope I impressed some folks enough to get what we'd need, even if that means giving up a fair bit of what we'd want. 4) I just went through this part of the negotiation and my advice is to make a list of things you want, based on priority, so #1 would be a spousal hire, and you start the negotiation there, remember to be creative and start with the highest bet, the TT offer, then maybe say in 2 years, then move down from there. My experience here was that they were not willing to offer a spousal hire, so the second most important thing was a salary increase, they didn't grant that either, so I didn't see a point in sending a startup list because without the previous thing it was an obvious no go for me and our family. I had to let than one go unfortunately. 2 again) If your partner isn't aiming for a TT research job, the University should be much faster to negotiate.  Usually eaiser to hire a lecturer than to come up with additional startup. 5) @4 were both of you willing to walk away from a TT R1 offer without any backup beyond existing postdoc positions? I have an offer than includes a non-TT mixed research/teaching position for my partner and neither of us have any other offers atm (although I have anothe interview scheduled). It seems risky to decline just to try again next year. 6) I did this last year and tried not to overdo it with startup while asking for a spousal hire...this was a mistake! They only gave me a vague promise that they would look into the spousal hire, increased my salary 5K/year, but still gave me less startup than other new hires that didn't require a TT spousal hire (though they DID get a non TT spousal hire while I did not). I don't see the chance of an actual spousal hire emerging in my case within the next few years at the current institution."
"can postdocs really compete with TT faculty applying for assistant profs? I wonder how well someone in a postdoc for several years (say 3-5) can compete with someone that is TT faculty (say someone that has been TT for, say, ~3 yrs, assuming both are very good and well-qualified.  Seems to me, the TT will always have the advantage given the teaching and mentoring experience, in addition to research 1) TT faculty good enough for a move up are more expensive! And not always as cutting edge! 2) The simple answer is yes - the proof is in the pudding: as assistant professorships are generally filled by postdocs. (3) I wonder though...seems to me many top schools who posted this year are interviewing jsut as many assistant profs as post-docs. A few examples would be UW-Madison, UBC-biomechanics, UF Theoretical position. (4) Word on the street is that UW and UF are intentionally trying to poach good faculty in these hard times.  Just rumors that I've heard.  can anyone confirm? (5) Pure rumor. I think you might find that the first offers went to post docs at least in most cases. (6) as a 1st year TT in the 2010 applicant pool, I can say so far:5 applications 0 interviews, 1 rejection letter.  Granted, 1 year TT is probably about the worst position to be in; I'm hoping by year 3 I'll be more competitive. (7) I know Univ. of Washington and Univ. of Arizona are  mostly interviewing TT professors.(8) Minnesota short-listed 5 candidates last year - at least 3 were already tenured (2 of which - a husband/wife - were offered and accepted positions). (9) like # 7, U Wy and MSU are picking TTs too; how can postdocs compete? (10) #6 again-I know Purdue a few years back considered only a few non-TT applicants.  Both my MS and PhD advisors had TT jobs before moving on to their permanent long-term TT positions.  Unfortunately for post-docs, I think this might be common.  The flip side is--it might be hard to attract really good folks away from their TT positions?

(10) TT folks are more known entities: you don't have to predict their future performance as a faculty member because they have a demonstrated record.  On the other hand, people should (and do in my experience) adjust their expectations based on the career stage of the applicant and can try to scoop up a hot youngster before anyone else.  So I'm not sure if the playing field is so uneven.","Montana State Univ positions news? interviews scheduled? 1) I got a no on 3/1 for terrestrial animals (2) #1 did you do a phone interview and just today got the decline? )3 #1 - no phone interview, just an email ""indicated they would keep application active"" but were inviting 5 for interviews. 3) Did everybody get that same email ? 4) i know at least 1 person has not received any rejection and another that was invited for an on campus interview 5) gor the same e-mail as #3 - did not get a phone interview. 6) talked to the department chair yesterday, and he said they were interviewing 3 people for the animal position and 4 for the plant position, starting the week of March 22 (but they haven't worked out the schedule yet)",NA,NA,NA,"Curious where folks ideal jobs would be (in a general sense).

Sad face, my friends. Sad face. 
2) I generally agree with this, although there may be a rare exception.  I think now we wait for tha spurt of postings that come between January and March.  It seems like the second round doesn't always have jobs as high quality as the first and that some are schools trying to replace folks they lost in the fall spurt of job postings, but, again, I'm sure there are exceptions.  My hopes are not very high for the spring job postings, but we'll see.  :(  Merry fucking Christmas! 
3) Completely wrong.  A LOT of schools, do not act on their applicant pool until the spring semester.  Over the past 10 years, I have applied to numerous schools.  The vast majority did not contact candidtates until after Christmas, and the vast majority of ads are up from Oct-Nov with a second pulse between Feb-Mar.  
4) I agree with #3, for example, my department at a large R1 has ~7 vacancies it needs to fill, due to new funding, retirements, and emigration. From a purely scheduling perspective, we MUST have searches going on throughout both semesters, as we can't have concurrent interviews going on.  We may be unique, but I expect not, at least in the R1 sphere. On top of that adminstrative delays can always delay a search well into Spring, so I would not despair just yet...(4). My experience after a five year serach is that the job ads dry up significantly after Dec. each year. One can only hope this year is different. 
5)  I also have to disagree with #3 and #4.  If a school is looking to fill one position and the deadline for applications was in October or early-mid November, the odds are very good that they've moved on.  I'm sure many of these will schedule campus interviews for the spring, but if you've not been contacted by now, I think you're either off the list or not on the short list.  Now, if the school is looking to fill multiple positions, there may still be a chance, but when this was the case for where I currently am, we'd do one or two searches one semester and one or two the next.  We wouldn't lump them all together in one semester.  ...but I'm sure everyone's comments are based on their individual experiences.  OP, why not let us know if you get contacted by any in the spring and we'll see how much water #3 and #4 hold with their comments.  If you're lucky, I'll eat crow with #2. 
#4 again) crow on my plate...sorry I misread the OP, yes, if deadline was in Oct/Nov, certainly not a good sign if you havn't heard anything...I misread thinking we were talking about the new postings in Fall vs. Spring...
6) Last year I was contacted for a campus interview on Jan 6 for a job at a top SLAC that had a mid-Nov deadline/early Dec Skype interviews.  So don't lose all hope!  
7) see figures posted to the right, it is of deadlines for vacancies posted over over a decade.  Notice that most have deadlines sometime in teh fall, but there is a period in Feb-March-Apr that is a minor peak some years.  I believe these are mostly vacancies produced from people announcing resignations in the fall after getting an offer elsewhere, but there are also a fair number of retiree replacements advertised with deadlines in this window.  Most spring windows for vacancies seem to open with relatively abbreviated windows to apply compared to the fall.  However, there are still a lot of vacancies posted after Christmas, so its not time to drink cyanide yet. Also, I too misread the post.  Happens to the best of us (you people) and me too!!

Several websites out there with exact information.  3)  Oh, I reviewed as many as I could find, but of the two phone interviews I had so far this year, both had some questions I've not seen on those lists that I felt unprepared to answer right on the spot, so it would be nice to see a venue like this maybe devote a new tab to all the questions we are asked. 4) this is the one I used to interview candidates this week: https://www.tamiu.edu/adminis/ohr/goodintquestfac.pdf 4) If you have clicked on the link tab, there is two URLs for phone interview tips listed since the start of this wiki page.

Just thinking that if School #2 offers more start-up, salary, etc. that can be used to my advantage with School #1. 2) First, congrats on your 1, possibly 2 offers! Would you be happy with either position or do you want one more than the other? It sounds like you want offer #1 to work out more than you want to accept offer #2. If you expect offer #2 to come in within the window you have to accept offer #1, I would wait before beginning negotiations. If you expect #2 outside of that window, I'd ask for an extension on offer #1. If they won't give you one, you're somewhat SOL and you should begin earnest negotiation with the offer you have rather than wait on an offer you *might* get.  3) Congrats indeed! Having multiple offers, while fortunate, is a tricky place to be from a negotiating perspective. Your first priority is (hopefully) to do everything in good faith: Don't waste the time of a school whose offer you aren't serious about just to try to level-up your offer elsewhere. And try to get everyone their answers quickly so that the schools you turn down can move down their lists. People gossip: assume that where you interview, who's going to offer, and how you comport yourself when negotiating will get around. When I was negotiating last year, I definitely struggled with the timing... One thing that I think helped was to be transparent with the schools that I was interviewing with once I had the first offer. I told them that I'd had an offer which I expected to affect the timeline of my decision-making, and, once I had a deadline from school #1, I told the other schools what that deadline was. In my experience, the other schools were very helpful in accomodating me by being transparent in their decision-making process and accelerating their verbal offers. In the meantime, I told school #1 that I was interviewing at other places, but didn't mention having other offers *until* I had a verbal offer. Once I had more than one offer, negotiations became much easier (and the timeline for my decision got extended). 4) Thanks for the advice! 5) Just expanding on #3 here, before starting to use one offer to leverage the other, make sure you are indeed happy to accept either offer. It's not unheard of for a school to feel strong-armed and rescind their offer without warning, leaving you stuck with only the other offer(s)... 6) @5, this might happen on occasion, but in my 13 years among the faculty, I've never seen it first or second hand. 7) #5 here: I've seen it twice in the last two years.","1) The one school I had an on-campus interview at today called and told me no.

You'd think I'd learn to not get my hopes up, but I really am surprised over and over, particularly when I know (at least I think I know) I'm a perfect fit for a position. I've served on numerous SC (even chaired one). I have tons of teaching experience in a diverse array of classes, have years of stellar teaching evals, have won numerous teaching awards (including both departmental and university-level awards), am fairly productive research-wise, etc. I know what SC are looking for and know how to produce a strong application. And yet...nothing. I actually think that my experience and age are starting to get in the way. There really is a downside to being a proven quantity. 2) I was just thinking of posting a very similar post on this veniting page but you beat me to it! 3) Same, first year of disappointment for me. I applied to some that I thought I would at least make the short list for....nothing. Not one bite. Great fit (I think), good pubs, independent teaching experience and multiple grants can't even get your references checked? I'm screwed. 3) A lot of good applicants out there. Doesn't matter how perfect you are. It's your competition that's important, and competition is steep! 4) @1, I think you are right that experience/age can be a significant hurdle to overcome. Are you currently tenured and looking to move? Either way, hang in there. 5) OP here. Thanks for the kind words. Not tenured but applying for tenure this year. I'm fairly confident I'll receive tenure here, and I'm actually reasonably happy...looking to move for family reasons. 6) You mentioned applying to smaller schools. Maybe smaller schools are less interested in lateral hires? 7) If you're close to tenure, then yeah, it's going to be hard to move (and only get harder after you're tenured...), for four main reasons. (and sincere apologies in advance if I'm just telling you things you already know) One, other institutions will worry that you're not serious about moving and are just looking for an outside offer you can use for leverage for a counter-offer from your current institution. If you're comfortable revealing your reasons for wanting to move in your cover letter, you should probably do so, it might help (have you already done so?). Two, you're more expensive to hire than someone who doesn't already hold a faculty position. You'd need to be paid a higher salary, and if the position has research expectations the hiring institution might worry you'd expect more startup. Three, you're a known quantity, or perceived as one. Your application will be judged according to different, higher standards than an application from (say) a postdoc. You need to be seen as a truly outstanding candidate on all relevant dimensions *for someone at your career stage*, otherwise the search committee is likely to prefer to offer the position to someone cheaper, with more perceived ""potential"", who is seen as more likely to take the offer. Fourth, if the institutions to which you're applying are different in important ways from your current institution, your experience might not count for as much with the search committee as you might think it would. For instance, if you're at research university but looking to move to a bachelor's college, or vice-versa. If you're trying to move to a different type of institution, your cover letter needs to explain why you want to do that and tell a compelling story about why you'd be able to pull it off. Good luck, it sounds like you're doing the right things and that you can make a strong case. It's just hard for people in your circumstances to move. 8) Agh, I don't want to hear this. I'm in my second year and feel a need to move for multiple reasons--hoping some good fits come up this cycle and next.","P&T pay bump What pay increases are considered typical for Assistant to Associate?

You should have a frank discussion with your PI right away.  Tell them that you don't feel like it's working out, and why.  See if they agree or not.  If so, figure out  some way to adjust the duties to suit your interests/skills.  I've had experiences like this as a PI and it would have turned out much better if the postdoc had initiated such a conversation.  In any case, there is no way you should even think about quitting.  Make the most of your year, then move on if you both still feel it's not a good match.  I would very much appreciate this as a PI and not think poorly of the postdoc; just the opposite.  Best wishes. 1) again. Thanks - #2. Your advice is assuring. 3) There is absolutely nothing unethical about your situation, unless of course you lied about your qualifications or something which I'm sure you did not. If you have already completed 4 months of a 12 month postdoc, why not just stick it out while applying for your next position? As 2 said, talk with your advisor about how to make the most of the rest of your time. #1 again. Thanks for the advice #3. I have a meeting scheduled for later this afternoon with my advisor. I am hoping to work something out and complete my full year.  4) How'd it go? #1 again. It was a rather interesting meeting. I guess I bought some time for now. He agreed that this wasn't working out and pointed out the specific things about my work that are concerning to him. However, he did not really suggest any changes in my tasks and only added to the list of things I need to complete. So, I'm left with figuring out a way forward and making it work, which isn't radically different from my situation before. But, I guess it was at least good to know that he was feeling it too. As you may tell, I am still going through my notes from the meeting. Thanks for the advice again!"
"Black Hole Awards in E&E I'd like to present all the Universities which never get back to you.  Specifically, those who never send you a rejection, and do not respond to polite emails. I did not include places that did not send an official rejection, but responded via unofficial email. Additional rule - only add those which have concluded their search. 1) My list begins: Fordham University - Biology, Portland State University - Biology, NMSU - Biology, Iowa State - NREM, Bryant University, Roger Williams University (phone interview).

(2) My list of Ass Hole, err...Black Hole Schools is long, I never heard a word from any of the following: Westminster College (PA), Coastal Carolina Univ., Northern Kentucky Univ., Naugatuck Valley Comm. College (actually glad they never replied...a sad moment of weakness and despair made me apply), St. Ambrose University, Rochester Institute of Tech., Canisius College, Morningside College, Shenandoah University, Westminster College (MO). (3) Um, pretty much almost everything I've applied for over the past 3+ years? Don't take it so personally. (4) #2 here, I don't take it personally, but several of these schools never even acknowledged my application until a rejection letter! (5) I applied to over a dozen jobs before a single one acknowledged my app. It never occurred to me they would. Who cares? Send your stuff and hope it gets there. If they want you, you'll hear from them...if they don't you might hear from them. (6) Sorry, have to disagree with #5, it's only common courtesy to acknowlege the application package, and give updates on what might be missing (i.e. LORs). As a veteran of over 100 applications and 6 SCs, this is minimal. (7) 5 here. I agree it's courtesy, but it's not very common. I don't feel that we should agonize over that part of the process when there is so much more to agonize over. I have gotten updates on missing things, but that is not the same as ""Yes, we got your app."" I don't have your level of experience with apps and SCs, but I do have a different idea of what is minimal: receiving nothing, at all, ever. That is what I (and I'll bet many of us) have experience with. I'm assuming by your comments that you are more communicative when you're on SCs. If that's the case, thanks, but I think you're the minority. (8) Oh come on, this is like worrying about what font was used when the editor rejected your manuscript. Some things are worth worrying about and others aren't worth the time it took to read this. Move on... By the way, as an ecologist, I appreciate ""unofficial email"". What a waste to send a hard copy in the mail when an email will suffice (and please don't edit my posts in the future - whoever did that).
9) OP here - #5, dudes, the point is to vent, right? So what if, in the big picture, it's a minor issue? If you don't care whether the SC ever sends a rejection, skip this and go on, OK? I understand that you're trying to be helpful, but sometimes venting here helps us let go of our annoyance/frustration. (10) 5 here. I was commenting on 4 who is worried about acknowledgements, not rejections. Not getting a rejection definitely sucks. I do care about that. However, telling people to relieve their stress by not stressing about little shit in the first place is how I vent. I can't stress about the little shit because I'm stressing about the BIG shit like feeding my family. So, feel free to not take my advice, but please don't yell at me about yelling at somebody else. Like you said, I'm trying to be helpful despite my tone, and venting helps me let go of my frustration. None of us want any of us to be in this boat. (11) They should acknowledge the receipt of your app, otherwise how can you say with any certainty that they screwed you out of a rejection letter? Maybe they never got your app in the first place. Just a thought. (12) OP here - #5, my misunderstanding - you're right. (13) 5 here.  No problem OP, sorry I blew my top.  @11, I totally agree they should acknowledge your app, but they often don't.  If they never got your app, they didn't really screw you out of an acknowledgement either, so what are we all complaining about??? ;)","negotiating All of the offers on the negotiations page are for ecology positions.  I might be getting an offer from a natural resources department (RU/H).  Does anyone know any good resources for figuring out what a reasonable offer is? There is one or two on the Biology Negotiation tab - lines 16, 20, and possibly 30.  Congratulations! (2) OP - Thanks!  I completely missed these is going through.  Much appreciated.  No congrats yet...  but hopefully soon :)",NA,NA,NA,"There are a couple of people on the anon quals page who say they joined a dept they hate. Any tips from such people on what to do to avoid getting in that situation? Any clues to the situation beforehand? 1) It is very difficult.  I have been in great and horrible departments.  Your best bet is to find people who previously worked there.  Alternatively, check the universities to fear thread on the wiki (linked via the helpful links & tips tab below).  Also, check salaries on chronicle (AAUP survey), and check their financial status on http://www.thesustainableBlow Jobs.com.  Generally, schools with problems, have problems that start at the money end.  What is the teaching load?  overworked faculty are more testy.  Thats some things 2) Here are two things you can do: (i) When you go on the interview, PAY ATTENTION TO RED FLAGS. This sounds simple, but desperation for a permanent job can cloud your judgement and paint a rosy picture. (ii) During the negotiations, PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT THE CHAIR/HEAD REFUSES TO PUT IN WRITING. There's a reason he/she doesn't want to put it in writing! While the causes of a ""bad department"" are varied, the things you can do to prevent yourself from joining one are actually pretty simple: pay attention to red flags and pay attention to what the chair/head will not put in writing during negotiations. It's ok to back out and post-doc for another year if the job doesn't feel right! 3) You can ask the junior faculty about what was good and bad about the place during one on one conversations.  You can usually tell by their answers or non-answers if there are problems. 4) #3 is a good strategy, as for #2, you will be hard-pressed to get anything in writing unless you are at a good school.  Crap schools target ABDs adn new graduates for a reason.  They will tell you they don't want damaged goods, basically.  The truth?  They want people they can falmboozle.  The first sign you are dealing with a crap school is if they are offering you a job and you have not yet graduated.  Why?  because there are too many graduated people on the market who are as good or better than any one of us, especially when we graduate. if they pass by I with experience to get someon with none, its obvious they are looking for a Piss ant.  That does not mean you should not take the job, it means you should recognize what is going on.  This has been true in 100% of the cases I am aware of involving early hirees.  unfortunately, many of these folks get their career damaged by these sh*tholes.  So, be careful. 6) At Master's level schools is where you learn that agreements on paper have no value. 7) See question about unions above. 8) how much turnover is there at the school  You can figure this out sometimes by asking, but a better approach is to go to the wayback machine [it's an Internet digital archive website] and check out the department. 9)  1) What kind of questions could I ask on an interview to make sure they aren't getting ""sugar coated"" answers? 12) #2 here. There are no questions you have to ask. Just pay attention to what the junior faculty tell you, that is all you have to do. Plus, pay attention to what the chair will not put in writing for your offer. Those are the promises he is very likely going to break. But another red flag you can watch out for is if the chair will not give you a straight answer about your teaching load. If the answer is confusing (i.e., your mother wouldn't understand the answer), then your teaching load will likely be very high.  13) If the chair puts something in writing and then chooses not to follow up on it, what sort of actions, if any are possible?  14) That is a very good question. I think chairs are more likely to feel compelled to stick to something if you politely waive an official, signed piece of paper in their face. You may also be able to go complain ""up the chain of command"" to the Dean if necessary. But I don't think you should rely SOLELY on getting everything in writing. Heeding red flags before you sign the contract is important too. If the place is a madhouse and the chair is dishonest, the agreements you have in writing may not be worth very much, or worth the effort for you to enforce for that matter. 15) Best just to record their butts during interview, then keep it for when they don't fess up.  some schools will tell you anything to fill there slot, the good ones really don't do this. 16) I don't think I'd recommend recording anyone during an interview. Going ""nuclear"" (producing a secret recording) isn't going to get you what you want, let alone allow your career to survive to see tenure. (17) um, it will hold up in most courts so long as you are in a state where it is legal.  so, you would have evidence to get pay that was not given, etc. + it would make it harder for them to release you without it appearing as retaliative.  I know one 'person"" in particular who did this outside of academia, and was awarded back pay + significant other moneys, for a job after being released when she questioned why certain things were not provided that were promised.  yes, it is a good idea.  Anyone who thinks it is not, well, what can i say. 18) # 16 here. It appears you know more about this issue than I do. Perhaps you are right. Still seems dangerous though. 19) Probably only something you want to do if you think your pockets are deeper than the Blow Jobs's and you are prepared to take a right to privacy case to the supreme court..  19) #18 this is not a right to privacy issues, and it already has presidence, its called law.  In some states a conversation can be recorded as long as one of the participants know, in other states all parties must know it is being recorded.  Further, sometimes it nice to know you remembered what you heard correctly and you KNOW your boss is an A$$ instead of you think he/she is. ",NA,"photo in CV 1) Anyone have any advice on chalk talks? I gave one last week, after practicing etc, and it was a disaster as far as I can tell. I was told to expect questions and interruptions, but nothing of the sort took place, people just stared at me as I spoke. Should probably kiss that job goodbye, right? 
2) What the fuck is a chalk talk? I suppose I can guess, but never heard of anyone being asked to give a talk without Powerpoint or similar for a job talk. 
3) Ditto here, never heard of this, sounds like hell on Earth  
4) Was it a teaching chalk talk or a future research plans one?  I've heard of search committees asking for both, but I've never done one, so I don't have any advice. 
5) Chalk talks are usually future research plans talks, and they are common especially at R1 institutions. It should be structured to highlight how your work will move the field forward in a coherent way that is attractive to funding agencies. The format varies widely among institutions. I've given several, and the fomat has varied every time.  In some places it is just sitting around a table with all the faculty in the department and discussing your science as if it were a high powered version of a proposal defense and with only chalk allowed. At other schools it's just another powerpoint talk in front of students, postdocs, and faculty where you might receive few questions until you finish the presentation. Because of the variety, it's hard to give advice other than be sure you know the format and audience. When I don't have a slideshow, I bring notecards with my organized talking points and example illustrations that I could draw on the board. Even if you do have slides, it should be pretty barebones, and you should not hesitate to go to the board to address questions from the audience.  
1 again) This was explicitly without powerpoint, me+chalk in a room ""discussing"" future research plans with faculty and others, but no one said anything. So there was no way to address questions from the audience! I just talked and talked and talked and wasn't sure at all what they wanted to hear from me, so I probably fumbled all aspects. 
6) That sounds awesome. Good way for a search committee to see how indepth you know your research and also how well you deal with stressful situations. Also, by taking away the powerpoint I think this would direct you to really hit the major impact points of your research in the most general of terms possible; i.e., you won't be able to draw mega trees, genes, massive ecological models, etc... on the board. 
7) just had another chalk talk today and I think they can be awesome: my audience was involved, asked questions and was interacting with my ideas. One friend told me to use the chalk talk to judge the faculty itself: if they do not have questions and are not interacting with you, is that really the place you want to work. In general, I prepare my talk based on the audience and and then just follow the flow. I normally write out three points that i want to cover throughout my talk and try to bring the audience back on track when we drift off.  
1 yet again) I agree with your friend - the lack of questions makes me wonder whether there is a fit problem (what on earth happened to my typing there?!) 
2 again) Ohhh, sounds just like grad school comps! FUN! I have one interview so far, and I am not being asked to do one of these. Thank the Flying Spaghetti Monster for that.  
9) I've never done one, but from reading this thread, I think it would frankly be fun!  ","Last year I had video interviews around now.  This year, none.  Commence freakout. 2) Me too...three phone/skype interviews last year down to none this year despite more pubs and a new fellowship etc. Hardest thing is not having any feedback on the process. Last year was my first year fully trying for a job and it seemed so promising... 3) I never thought I would become one of those negative people that complain about academia, but this process has taken away that positive part of me. 4) Welcome to the Dark Side.",NA,"So any ideas for a job if you don;t find an academia position? I'm NOT adjuncting 2) You almost certainly have skills that are valuable outside academia. We tend to forget how amazingly qualified we would be in a large number of industry & non-profit positions. We have experience leading and managing projects, analysing and presenting data, writing and speaking. Don't underestimate how much those abilities matter! ","Sample publication Would you submit an older article (e.g. 2015) that is in a higher impact journal or a newer article (e.g. 2016) that is still high quality but in a lower impact journal? What if the older article is slightly more related to the specific job requirements? 2) I would definitely submit the older one if it is better and more related and especially if it is only 2015 (not that old!). I guess if it was much older and less related to what you do now then I would lean toward the newer one. I wonder how much the publications really matter with most applications anyways? Maybe someone who has been on a few search committees can chime in. My guess is that they would only matter at the very short list stage if at all and they can always pull papers from your cv/website too. 3) I'd submit the one best related to the job ad. They can see from your CV that you have newer papers and can check on Google Scholar (you've a profile, right?) to see citations. Your writing sample is about what you want them to know beyond the date and citation statistics.(I've put my money where my mouth is by submitting a 2010 book chapter rather than a 2014 paper with 100+ citations as one of my samples).  4) I would never submit a book chapter (or a review). That sounds like you don't value research papers.  Submit the most relevant research paper first, the biggest impact paper second.  X2. 5) I submitted pubs that were in review or in press (when they were relevant to the job ad), because that gave the committee a chance to see something they wouldn't find otherwise. 6) To #5, I had two faculty members tell me not to submit manuscripts in in review/revision, because doing so suggests my publication history is too weak and not enough high-quality pubs are already accepted. 7) I don't have any pubs from my post-doc yet but do have several in revision (conditionally accepted) so when the search asks for 3 papers, I submit the two best published papers from my PhD and the manuscript (in revision) that will be going to the best journal from my post-doc.  Not sure if this is the way to go but I've made long/short lists.  5 again) I got multiple R1 offers using this strategy (submitting in review pubs). I feel pretty confident search committees look at your CV before reading your writing sample so they'll see your publication history there.","My wife and I decided that one of the best things we could do for our environment would be to not have biological children. Reducing, reusing, and recycling are all great, but they don't have nearly the impact that lowering our reproductive output has. My wife and I are both in TT positions and not really on the job market. But I still visit this forum from time to time, if only to remind myself how depressed I was for five years after grad school and before landing my first TT job. It's also a good reminder of how happy I am to be at an undergraduate-focused institution, where I am not producing more PhDs who will inevitably find themselves in the same boat most people here are in...competing with a bunch of apex job seekers for a relatively few number of jobs. Don't get me wrong; I understand that there is a fundamental need for more scientists for the same reasons that there is a fundamental need for more children. But it seems like there ought to be a limit to the rate of scientific reproduction. I mean, news flash...we've reached our academic carrying capacity and competition is fierce. So is suffering. And just as I believe many of our environmental problems would be solved by confronting the elephant in the room represented by too many people, the academic job crisis will be improved by producing fewer PhDs. But the machine keeps spitting them out each year, one after the other. And the irony is, many of the machine's offspring can't wait to jump on board and make the situation worse. 2) Hmmmm, jumping on a board and making it worse you say? 3) It seems like there should be better financial support for science funding/public universities/governmental agencies so that we can be a scientifically productive country with good jobs for good people. Keep voting and calling reps, everyone. x2 4) We should have a lottery system that assigns everyone an occupation.","phone/skype interview advices I had 6 among phone and skype interviews, and none on-campus invitation. I surely do something wrong and wonder if you have any advice. I am usually prepared on the programs, department, and faculty, and show enthusiasm. Not sure what I do wrong. I'm happy to receive any sort of advice. 2) I think you probably did nothing wrong.   3) Sometimes phone interviews just felt like a way for the committee to humor someone then not invite me anyway.  Still, 0/6 might be concerning.  Make sure you have questions for them about the school and what it is like to live there.  It could just be you are too junior but they think you are exciting-- you know your CV better than we do.   Does your CV have any weak spots?  Like tons of pubs but no teaching for SLACs?  Or light on pubs but great on ""potential""?  If so, there's a fixable problem and you will have very good odds next year if you can fill in the gap.  4) Yeah, it's my impression that the committee generally has their mind pretty made up about who they want to invite before the phone interviews anyway and it would take an extremely good/bad performance to move around on that list. I sort of hate phone interviews for this reason. So it really sucks that you didn't get any on-sites but I think the other commenters are right - fill any weaknesses you can this year, but a lot of it is just bad luck. 5) If it's any consoloation, I'm currently 0/4. My own impression is that I tend to ramble too much - I get rather flustered and then start to think on the spot rather than revert to my main talking points - and, thus, maybe I exasperate the interviewers. 6) Here #1. Thank you for the support. As a non-native English speaker, I thought maybe my accent/pronounciation/English is not good enough for an academic position. (My English gets worse when I am nervous.) They never showed that they don't understand me though. I am truly trying to improve myself without blaming bad luck or SC previous ideas of the candidates. And yes, I do make several questions as well, and I am not a junior candidate. Well...I have the 7th phone interview this Friday and see what happens.  7) If you have more than 3-4 skype interviews but have no onsite invitation, it is more likely that you did something wrong in the interviews. I don't think it is mostly due to pre-determined mind of SC--otherwise they won't bother to interview you. For #1, having 7 skype interviews is really impressive. I strongly suggest you to try to have a mock skype interview with one friend or colleague who is in science but not an expert in your field. 8) I disagree a little with #7. When making a top 10 list of canddiates to phone interview, that's our top ten based on your credentials. To be honest, there's not a lot of major movement of candidates after the phone interviews. People might gain or lose one or two spots at the most. I've only seen one candidate who really bombed a phone interview move more than 2 places after a phone interview (was basically dropped out of contention). It might just be that the OP is consistently being ranked in the 5 to 10 range and none of the other candidates are making major mistakes to drop them from their higher positions. I've always thought we phone/skype too many candidates. There are always 3 or 4 that are our obvious favorites before we go into phone interviews, and those candidates are typically the ones we campus interview. The other candidates are really just there as a function of ""hedge betting."" Just keep in mind, after a SC makes a top 10 list to phone interview, we don't wipe the slate clean and disregard your packet; it's the total package. This is a little different once you get to the campus interview stage b/c all faculty are meeting candidates, and the majority of them were not on the search committee and therefore didn't examine the application packets in detail. Anyways, this is just my experience at my university, I can't disagree with #7 fully because #7 might have completely different experiences, which is what makes getting a job in academia so difficult. No university does it the same. 9) I have never been on the search-committee end of a skype interview, but I whole heartedly support #7 in doing practice interviews with colleagues and/or a university career center. The odds of being in the 5th-10th spot all 7 times are low. I BOMBED my first skype interview, and said things that were just dumb (called undergrad students ""kids"" - why would my nervous brain do that to me?). After that, I practiced and felt much better on subsequent skype calls. You have my full respect for interviewing in a non-native language - if nerves make it worse, practicing is probably the best way overcome that. Committees may not tell you if they don't understand you well, since almost no one gets any feedback at the skype interview stage.","I am disappointed the very long thread on the potential lawsuit to university and racism/bias in academia has disappeared.x2 2) I think deleting that post was a smart thing for that person to do. x3 3) I thought the post should stay.

OP here. I NEVER EVER deleted that post. I have been moving past 2 weeks, and never had a chance to come back to this board until today (September 9). And in my surprise, I don't see my post here anymore. So, who deleted my post? Why? Did somebody write something sensitive that I missed while travelling past 2 weeks?!? Is there anyway I/someone can revive the post?? Also, an update. During my moving time (I was on the road) I was contacted by the school's OEO & was told that they reviewed all the info, and couldn't find anything wrong, and so they're closing my case. I responded politely that I expected that, but gave just 2 examples (didn't wanna show them all my cards in hand) why they were completely wrong, and biased, and how an independent panel (by court order) would reveal the truth. I also told them that I was ""required"" to give them a shot to investigate, and so, now they'll see the consequences, and I meant it. They will. However, I received an immediate response from their HR director that she is still reviewing everything, and kinda requesting me to wait before I move to court. So, I'm still waiting, and no settlement reached as of 9th September. In any case, again, I did NOT delete the post, and don't know how to get it back here (any help?). And I have a feeling that someone from the school is monitoring this page as well. 15) see #7's post on how to find the old thread ","Major Grant The discussion on “major grant” below got me thinking about a related topic. When I was a grad student my advisor refused to have anything to do with grad student grants with the argument that “it is a competition among students and not advisors, so your work must stand on its own” or something similar as I’m paraphrasing numerous conversations. This was the case for everything, GRFP, DDIG, university grants, society grants, etc. I’ve thought this likely put me a sizeable disadvantage as I had no idea what made a successful grant, and I know other students’ advisors gave considerable support and contributed greatly to writing. I was wondering what other people’s experiences were with grad student or even postdoc grants. 2) I think you're right that this would put you at a disadvantage. In my experience, I received a lot of support from my advisor and other faculty when applying for grants as a grad student and also as a postdoc, and I think that's the most common case. Now, I've been advising new grad students on their GRFP applications, and I have to say that I doubt a student could produce a really competitive application on their own, just because everyone else is getting really valuable feedback from more experienced faculty. That seems like a pretty unfair position for an advisor to take, in my opinion. It benefits everyone in the lab for grad students to be successful in obtaining grants, and all of us have learned through the help of others. 3) Agree with 2, though there is also a difference between providing lots of comments and conceptual/organizational suggestions (which my advisor did) and making extensive line edits that can amount to writing large sections of the grants (which I know some advisors do). Leaving you entirely on your own seems like shirking the responsibility of being an advisor! 4) I got my GRFP without advisor input; I wrote the application in my senior year of undergrad, and didn't know I was *supposed* to ask the professor I was working with for feedback.  I'm honestly shocked, in retrospect, that I got it, but I suspect that people who aren't yet grad students are judged on different standards than those who are.  I think anyone trying to apply without advisor feedback is, indeed, at a huge disadvantage.  5) In Canada, NSERC graduate scholarships are supposed to be written ""independently"" by the student and the contributions of others' words/ideas have to be acknowledged.  It's not clear to me what this means.  When I'm asked to provide a reference for a student, I always ask for their research proposal so I can discuss it in the reference letter.  I will give students information on how to write a good proposal, but I will give them only general feedback on the proposal they send me (nothing specific), such as ""you need to better explain the impact of your research in the final paragraph"", etc.  Because I agree that it is supposed to be a competition among students.  So I mostly agree with the advisor.  If it were a different scholarship/grant application that did not specify that it is a competition among students, then I would provide more specific feedback. 6) That may very well be the case for NSERC grants in Canada, but in my experience it is VERY common for advisors to provide a lot of input on GRFPs and DDIGs. I think having a rule stating you will provide no input on these submissions from your students is a little harsh, and definitely puts those students at a severe disadvantage.  7) It is also surely the case that many supervisors help their students with their NSERC grants.  But two wrongs don't make a right. 8) Is/wasn't it the case the advisors were technically the PI on GRFP and DDIGs? 9) Advisors were technically the PI on DDIGs, but not on GRFPs (which don't include a research budget). 10) Yep, DDIG is a grant, and the advisor is the PI; GRFP is technically a fellowship and not a grant, and there is no research budget for it (nor is it actually tied to the project you propose).  It's money to the student, not money to the project.",NA,"Active learning in job talk? Does anyone have any experiences/successes implementing active learning during your research talk (ie not during a separate teaching demo)?  2) Faculty are often averse to new things.  I wouldn't do this for the world. 3) I agree that it could be risky-- I've done simple things like asking a probing question / something funny or easy to answer. 4) 1 here again--I am nervous about it, but the instructions for the research talk specifically said to demonstrate techniques you would use in the classroom! I wouldn't do it otherwise. This is at a PUI that is very big on active learning and there is not a separate teaching demo. I have some ideas but am just curious if anyone else has pulled this off!  2) Can you run it by the search chair to make sure that's what they want?  3) There are cool software packages that allow audiences to respond in real-time to questions in a talk - kind of like clickers, but much more user-friendly.  One such package is Polleverywhere - all audiences need are web-enabled devices and no up-front prep on their part (https://www.polleverywhere.com/) - and no, I have no conflicts of interest to declare :) 4) Polleverywhere can be great software for teaching, but I definitely would not ask the job talk audience to download something in advance of your talk. ""Think Pair Share"" is a better technique. For a poll, just ask them to hold up a number of fingers in response to a multiple choice question on a slide.  5) OP here. In case anyone is thinking of trying this, I had one open-ended question at the beginning of my talk, 3 multiple choice questions, and a place where I asked them to sketch a prediction of what a graph would like before I showed it. It seemed to be well-received. This article has other ideas: https://www.lifescied.org/doi/10.1187/cbe.17-07-0146 "
"Attitude of those who came before us Anyone else annoyed by the somewhat condescending attitudes of colleagues who finished just a few years prior to us? I got my PhD in a top ranked department. People who graduated a few years before I did ALL got jobs at R1s, often with multiple offers, and not a crazy amount of pubs. Of all the people in my cohort (which actually finished a few years ago) the only ones who have academic jobs are those who went to smaller teaching universities. It sucks and what's even worse is all the, now junior professors, don't get what we out here are dealing with. It's like they feel sorry for us because we are not as good as them! Very few of them seem to understand that reality is different now. It's like rubbing salt into our wounds, not only are there almost no jobs and hundreds of good people applying for them, but our currently employed peers think we just aren't quite as good as they are. UGHH! (1) I haven't run into those people, thankfully. My friends who graduated a few years before me realize that they were lucky to be searching in a good market. (2) I've come across a few types like what the OP describes. It's frustrating!. But, I've also come across many who keep saying that the market is bouncing back and that in the next year or so, there will be an influx of lines, from retirement, death, and expansion. I don't see it!! Instead I see these old, run down, TT faculty staying on long after they should retire and make room for new people. The retirement environment today sucks so they figure why leave a cushy spot. (3) I've seen some of what the OP mentions and it is frustrating b/c it adds insult to this already difficult process. As for the market bouncing back - I wouldn't count on it. I believe the new rules indicate retirement not required until 75! The older folks I work with who were considering retirement can no longer afford to (loss of investments and furlough). (4) It's going to get MUCH worse before it gets better! (5) I agree, I don't see it getting much better in the very near future. If the economy keeps creeping out of the toilet you may see more retirements and an increase in job openings. But you have to consider that there are a lot of people like us still on the market, that departments are still cranking out PhDs, and that there are probably a bunch of people out there in less than ideal jobs who are just waiting for things to open up a bit before they try the market again. I anticipate a real feeding frenzy for the next few years, at least. As for attitudes of those who have gone before us, the one I get most frequently is absolute confusion. These people have been telling me for two years now that they can't understand why I'm not getting interviews, and they keep suggesting things to change about my application package--different letter writers, new research or teaching statements, different CV formats, etc. I don't think they realize how bad it's gotten. (6) I haven't had many older colleagues talking to me about the current situation in condescending tones. What I'm really annoyed by is many people, my own friends and some posters on the general wiki Whine page, lecturing me about how we PhD's are too narrowly minded about our career goals in obtaining academic jobs. Basically the suggestion is that we should abandon our ""dreams"" and the work that we have been doing for the last decade or so, and switch to something that's easier to get a job in. To me that amounts to career prostitution. (7) Like #6, I have had many friends comment that I should ""think outside the box"". While I don't listen to these friends, I do listen very much to my husband (who is not an academic) and our concerns about money and health insurance for us and our 2 kids are real. I love what I do and I don't want to do something else, but my decision impacts three other people, and as positive as I'd like to be, there is no certainty I'll get a job next year (clearly I didn't get one this year), and ""waiting it out"" might not be an option. At least for me, the family dynamic combined with the job market situation makes this all much more stressful. 8) I hear #7 and as one in a very similar situation I can tell you I have already started thinking outside the box and looking outside of academia (despite the fact that I can't think of anything else I would like to do). Sorry to say it, but the environment outside of the box is not much better. First, there aren't a lot of appealing jobs out there (unless you want to start working in business, computers, or retail--just shoot me). The kinds of jobs we might be interested in (i.e. NGOs or perhaps government, scientific editing or freelance writing) are equally few and far between and also receiving lots of applicants. In the past, I have thought about starting up a private research outfit (there is a precedent for this, see Wildlife Genetics International in Nelson BC) but now is not really the time for that considering that most start-up companies struggle to get any money. It's pretty rough and from what I have experienced and seen the more we slog through this situation the more we take it personally (even though we shouldn't). Perhaps that is our biggest challenge these days, just making it through all this crap with our souls and self confidence intact. (9) To # 7 & 8, good luck with your new career path, and thank you for relieving (somewhat) the glutted job market. 10) Sorry to disappoint you #9, no one said we were leaving, just looking elsewhere as well...","Univ of Arkansas It's been a while since the deadline and when the SC said they'd have a shortlist. Anybody have an inside track on this search? 1) I'm still waiting...seems they should have at least had interview candidates lined up by now. Maybe they do but none post on the wiki??? (2) I contacted the search chair who said they had an unusually large pool to drudge through. This was some weeks ago though. 

3) Another week of waiting, another week of silence. This is nerve-wracking. (4) Yes, it does seem to be getting incredibly late for this position. Who's going to contact the SC???
5) 1-2-3...Not it! (6) And another week...",NA,NA,NA,"This question is somewhat related to the one below about avoiding shitty departments/schools.  Are there any faculty here who are on unions?  How do faculty unions factor into the ""shittyness"" of a department/school.  I know they're not very common but I've talked to a few folks who are at schools that have a unionized faculty, and they don't seem to have the same problems that some posters in the previous question describe. 1) That's complicated, but I would say that in general unions do NOT matter that much for us, because we are in biology or other allied research'ish departments. Unions are more important for humanities departments, where the teaching loads can get very onerous (5 courses per semester or more) and the salaries are even lower than those of us with biology tenure-track positions. Here's my reasoning: unions negotiate at the whole-Blow Jobs level. Therefore, they assure the humanities departments a salary floor and a teach ceiling that biology departments typically don't have to worry about (because biology department faculty salaries, however meager, will be above that salary floor anyway and because biology faculty teaching, however much, is typically less than the other departments, at least a little bit anyway). From the standpoint of biology faculty, unions become more important at shitty schools where biology faculty teach as much as humanities faculty (which is not usually the case as long as the biology faculty have some research expectations), but in general, I wouldn't say that unions are NOT an important factor in biology departments at Masters-level and PhD-level schools when gaging shittiness/awesomeness. I would still apply the ""red flags"" tests in the previous discussion thread, below, rather than focusing on unions or lack thereof as a proxy for danger. But the more the biology department is treated like any other department, with no teaching releases for research or salary boosts to attract good researchers, the more important unions become. But then in those situations, the biology department is shitty anyway, because the biology faculty are at/near the Blow Jobs's salary floor and teaching ceiling, which is when unions are needed! Does this all make sense?  2) Unions per sey may not be critical, but there are serious differences between union states and right-to-work states.  Also, if there is an obvious presence of AAUP, that is a good sign.  How about, is their a faculty chair in addition to an administrative chair?",NA,"Postdoc ad 1) Um, where did all the discussion go that was here?  Is it me or are they moving kinda slow on this?  It's been almost a month since closing.2)  Of course it's taking a while.  Do you know how much these people teach?!  3) That didn't stop the folks at Sewanee from inviting three folks for campus interviews a week after closing, but I understand, especially if a lot of those 180 applicants are good.4) The teaching load at UNCA is higher than Sewannee.  Also, each round of cuts at UNCA has to approved by the dean, which is likely to slow things down a bit. 5) Huh, never heard of that before, but I wonder if the Dean can power through them pretty easily. 6)  I think that the short list has to be approved by human resources not the dean.  Regardless, 180 applications is a lot to go through! 7)  Where I am the department picks who they want to interview and then the Dean approves them prior to setting up their travel arrangements.  Human Resources plays no role at this stage.  What I think is interesting is a Dean having to approve every one of the 177 that are cut from the search.  Maybe it's to eliminate departmental/personal bias in the selection process 8) 4 here, I meant that HR must approve the shortlist, not the dean.  Sorry for the confusion!  9)  Usually most HR involvement is just in whether or not you are legal to work in the USA.  Makes more sense that the Dean would look over qualifications and give final approval, but I guess every school is different.  I hope we hear soon.  Now, #4, Mr./Mrs. Inside Source, I actually had a conversation with the Dean last summer and he indicated that the Biology Department would be searching for TWO positions.  Know anything about that? 10) They searched for a microbiologist last fall.  I'm not sure if that was successful or not.  11) No, I talked to the Dean after that.  Seems like maybe they needed replacements for Petranka and the previous chair, as I think they both just retired.  The website seems to indicate that there is already a new microbiologist there.  IDK then. 12) At my university, HR has to approve a comparison grid on how you will evaluate applicants before the job is posted, must confirm that the grid ratings were consistent with the people invited for phone interviews before they are invited, must approve the phone interview questions, and must approve that the campus interviewees were consistent with the ratings from the phone interviews; i.e., the university covers its ass at every level of the job search so if someone comes back and says, ""how was person A chosen over me?"", HR can say, ""b/c they were rated higher than you by these criteria during the 'x' round of application review."" Doesn't take long for HR to approve each level (a day), but they have to approve every aspect of the search. Dean has no input on any of this besides approval for a search, which then has to go up the ladder, and approving the individual that the faculty agree to higher, which then has to go up the ladder. 13) This is similar to how things work now at UNCA. 14) Noticed that the ""School"" column was changed from UNCA to Michigan State.  I've changed it back and deleted the second entry.  I think that all of the previous comments have been restored. 15) So no word yet for anyone? 16) Phone interview scheduled for 12/9.

","SC Venting #3: Listing your co-first author papers.  I’ve seen 3 different candidates’ CVs fail to credit co-first authors on major papers when the applicant happens to be listed first.  One of them had 3 other co-first author papers where he was listed 2nd, and you better believe he marked those as co-1st, but not the flashy new paper where he was listed 1st.  Don’t $%#!@ do that!  At some point in the process, someone’s likely to notice.  And then there are basically two interpretations:  either the candidate is intentionally manipulating their publication list to boost their apparent accomplishments at the expense of their collaborators, or they’re the type of person who unconsciously overcredits their own contributions (or else they’re just extremely careless/clueless).  Regardless, it’s a major point against these applicants, and in our case has prevented them from being considered further. (2) Applicants are just trying to stand out any way they can...go take a walk or something. 3) Holy shite man, calm down #1. I've been on five SC over the years and chaired one, and seriously.....who gives a crap about things like that. Sounds like you have an awful lot of time on your hands, are angry at the world, or both. 4) I appreciate the SC finds the time and the willing to post on this website; I swear, as soon as I find a job there is no way I go back here. Although, please consider we just try to survive in a big pond full of competitive candidates. We take your suggestions seriously, but don't get mad if we make mistakes by trying to make our application more appealing at your eyes. It is difficult to be remembered by the SC. You were on this side one time. 5) Gotta take the side of the OP on this one. If I were on a SC, I would be really annoyed at an applicant who pointed out co-1st authorships only when it was personally convenient. x7 6) Ummmm, I think this may be my application you are ‘anonymously’ referring to here and I can confirm that it was a mistake. 7) Wow. First year on the job market and reading this job board does nothing but bring me down. 8) Agree w/ OP that is an obvious attempt at gaming the system and deserves to be called out. x2 9) Perhaps what you see is a more accurate representation of what a person has accomplished - I have one such paper, with my name first, and I do not indicate on my CV that 'both authors contributed equally' because the simple fact of the matter is that they did not (but as a junior colleague I was put in the position of having to appease a senior colleague who was not playing well with others). All papers have their own, often complex, back stories. I would recommend you not jump to such negative conclusions about ones motives. x2 10) If you ain't ferst, yer last! 11) @9: by extension of that logic, it would also be fine for an applicant to re-arrange or remove coauthors' names on their CV if they felt that their contributions weren't justified. Heck, maybe I'll just make all my papers single-author. 9) @11, nope, not the same thing. For the papers on which I'm last/senior, I do not add a line beneath to wave my hands and say, 'hey, look, I'm senior author on this, this, and this....' That would be tacky. Frankly, being on SCs myself, I roll my eyes anytime someone lists co-first-authorships, because the person who is first/corresponding very often is so for good reason. Do you really think that for all co-first-author papers, both authors REALLY contributed the same amount? Want more first-author papers? Write them. 12) Ummmmm. I dont have a mechanism to indicate ""co-first"" authorship on my CV. Is that odd? I simply list all the authors and put my own name in bold to make it easier to see where I am in the list. 13) That's exactly what you should do 12. It's irresponsible for SC to jump to conclusions as 9 pointed out. 14) Sorry, but if you selectively neglect to mention co-first-authors only on those papers in which your name comes first, but then mention it when your name is second, that is a really misleading & shady strategy. You better hope your more honest co-first-authors are not applying for the same job. x4 15) As a job applicant, I agree with #1, assuming these are official shared first-authorships.  16) OP is correct.  It is dishonest to only selectively list which papers are co-first authorships.  Don't do it. 17) I've been in the same situation as 9, where I had a recent flashy co-first-authorship where the 'co' person listed second was only listed as such because of a last-minute, highly unethical power play, but I still list it. That said, I agree with others that OP needs to chill out.","Contacting SC after phone/skype interview If you haven't heard back from the SC following a phone interview (it's been over a month), is it ok to contact the SC? I have heard back following other skype interviews within 24 hours (on-site invite), 1 week (rejection) and 5 weeks (on-site invite). I assume if I haven't heard back within 6 weeks that I am out of the game, but I am wondering if there is protocol for contacting the SC just to see. Thoughts? 2) Unless you have a competing offer with a time constraint, I would just wait it out... 3) I've never seen it work out negatively for a candidate who contacted a SC. I have friends that are super squirmy and contacted SCs all the time about updates. All of them are currently in tenure-track positions. Personally, I never contact SCs unless I'm pulling my name from a search. I have never had a competing offer, but if I did, I would contact the SC to let them know my timeline and to see if I could get their timeline. I really never cared to contact an SC otherwise b/c it doesn't get you anywhere. Yeah, it would be nice to know so that you aren't jumping out of your seat everytime the phone rings or an email comes through, but ultimately it won't change anything. ","Schools that make your write special statements... ugh! Even tops rec-letters-submitted-by-everyone-up-front on the not-cool application shenanigans x5  2) One app wanted the research statement broken into 20 sections, but couldn't just be copied from the (so carefully crafted) research statement I had.  I eventually bailed.  Maybe that's what they were hoping for?? 3) Sounds like the UK and their ""person specifications"" 4) I hear you #2!

Also a lot of the diversity fellowships have a teaching component. For a pure teaching, I kind of consider VAP positions analagous to postdocs. 3) Chapman University, Radford University, and University of Montana also have teaching+research postdoc programs. 4) The IRACDA programs (University of Arizona, Stanford, Emory, others I don't remember) compbine research and teaching.

"Another media commentary on our bleak situation http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=does-the-us-produce-too-m&offset=6 (1) ""In fact, however, only about 25 percent of those earning American science PhDs will ever land a faculty job that enables them to apply for the competitive grants that support academic research."" Yikes. (2) I actually thought 25% was pretty good. I would have guessed it to be lower than that. (3) A colleague pointed out to me that this number really makes no sense. This figure includes all science PhDs and does not take into account those who do not wish to go into tenure-track jobs at a university. There may be more of these in fields like chemistry or geology, where many PhDs intend to go into industry. The percentage of PhDs who wish to get a tenure track position and eventually do so is probably (much?) higher than 25% over the long haul, although it certainly doesn't feel like it this year. (4) I strongly disagree, #3. I think many people change their goals as a result of seeing how screwed up academia is and how low the chances of getting a good tenure track are. And many more will reach that decision before they get a tenure-track job. But the numbers are pretty clear across the sciences, people who start PhD's at major research universities (which are also the universities that produce the most PhD's) are overwhelmingly looking for tenure track jobs at the end. Of course many start re-evaluating this almost immediately, but one could argue this is because they can see the writing on the wall even then: this is not a viable career path. (5) I'd like to see the data specifically for biology. 6) I think this article is spot on. It's unfortunate that many current TT faculty continue to not recognize this problem, when it is pretty obvious. And no, I am not one of the unproductive ""whiners"". A quick look at the anon. quals. will also tell you that there are many super talented postdocs and others on here. I have a greater quantity and quality of pubs. than my current postdoc mentor and my next postdoc mentor, who are both TT professors at R1 positions. I am sure many others on here are in the same boat. (7)  #4 is correct and it is called ""survivorship bias"".  See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias  We all suffer from this, especially our PhD and post-doc mentors who are obviously the survivors.  ","Univ of the Pacific Does anyone know the story here? Did they really interview 3 people and find all 3 were not acceptable? according to the venting page, yes.

Not that uncommon really, see the other posts on the venting page (2/22 and 2/26)",NA,NA,NA,"Although this is the ecology wiki, there are lots of jobs that are pretty far from ecology: bioinformatics, physiology, genetics, etc. A lot of us overlap fields so that makes sense, but I wonder if there's another similar site out there with additional updates from geneticists or physiologists. This is a great site and I hope everyone keeps posting updates on all types of jobs here. no. 2) This is a question I have seen on the wiki in previous years as well. As far as I know, there is no similar site for other fields of biology. Of course that doesn't mean we need to post ""their"" jobs for them. But I still think its good that jobs are posted here that are not strictly labelled ""ecology"" or ""evolution"" jobs. For instance, a job labelled ""physiologist"" could be of interest to our community because an ecophysiologist could apply; a job labelled ""developmental biologist"" may of interest to I studying evo/devo; many of our ecology/evolution folks may like to have a crack at the general ""biologist"" job adverts. When I post jobs on here, I first get them from ECOLOG and Evoldir; if I has advertised to those listservs it usually overlaps with the interests of our community on here. I then go to higheredjobs.com and look for other biology faculty positions that would potentially fit I traind in ecology/evolution. I do not post any jobs that ask for cell and molecular biology people, for example, or biochemists, because there is no potential tie-in to ecology and evolution. But jobs in bioinformatics, physiology, and genetics, in my opinion, ARE, in fact, part of our domain. Bioinformatics, for instance, can mean a lot of different things. It can mean parsing nucleotide sequence data, but it can also mean working with other sorts of ""big data,"" including large environmental datasets (so-called ""ecoinformatics."") Furthermore, even if I is working with sequence data as a bioinformatician, they may be studying comunity genomics or integrative biology that ties into ecology. Similarly for genetics. I can be an ecological geneticist or an of a variety of different kinds of evolutionary biologists. Thus while I agree there are some ""core"" ecology and evolution jobs that unquestionably belong here, there are also jobs that *could* match our community that I think also belong here. Another advantage of taking a more expansive view of what jobs to post is that it makes the site useful to a broader group of people, and more people = more eyeballs = more word-of-mouth for the wiki = more updates and postings. 4) back a long time ago, when this wiki was just a young child it was a biology wiki.  At some point, it was divided up into a series of life sciences subjects which was a disaster because there were things posted on multiple lists, etc.  Then, we changed it to I believe 2 categories:  ecology-evol-org, and molecular-clinical type stuff.  The latter simply degraded into nothing, especially after the remarkable series of vandalism attacks on here.  Some individual/s posted leud pictures, deleted dates, deleted pages, slandered people.  It was an amazing time.  During that series, we moved it off of the academic wiki with wikia and onto the google spreadsheet.  It was also moved one time prior from antoehr wiki server to wikia during the same series of events.  Once on the spreadsheet, we were able to lock out certain individuals for a while by requiring people to login.  Clearly, that kind of violated the whole purpose of this, but it ridded us of the source, whoever or whatever that was!  The tangent positions don't hurt anything, and some of us might apply to a molecular or GIS position because of our background despite being an ecologist/env sci.  I think we just leave them be and thank them for also being interested! :)  OP here: I am glad we include positions that are tangential to ecology - I was just looking for _more_ information on the progress of some of those tangential positions since there aren't so many people on this site providing feedback on them  5)  Many times schools are advertising for individuals to teach a particular course or set of courses, but they leave the research area open.  In my current position, I was hired to teach human anatomy & physiology, but my research program focuses on molecular phylogenetics, behavioral biology, and conservation biology and I typically work with herps.  So, I think putting human anatomy & physiology, human anatomy, human physiology, vertebrate physiology, and vertebrate anatomy job postings here is not a bad thing, as many of us can teach these classes even though we do not conduct research in any of these areas.  I feel that with cell & molecular biology positions, that it may potentially go the same way if the school is just looking for I to teach molecular biology, as many of us that conduct population genetic, molecular phylogenetic, phylogenomic, and genomic research can probably teach molecular biology given enough prep time, as we need a foundation in molecular biology to do what we do.  6) #5, same thing for A&P for virtually anyone who is a zoologist/animal ecologist. 7) #6 you are showing your vertebrate bias. I study insects and wouldn't know where to start with human A&P but ok...point taken that to teach a class it does not have to be the exact thrust of your research program",NA,"professional negotiator 1) Not to be discouraging, but it may be worthwhile to consider some information gleaned from the Anon Quals page. There are 42 applicants on the page. Collectively, they have received 35 campus visits and 51 phone interviews. However, they are not evenly distributed. The 4 candidates with the greatest number of invites account for 51% of all invites The median for phone interviews and campus visits is 0. For the record, I'm one of the zeroes - I'm putting this out there mainly to increase awareness and knowledge of the process. 2) and? 3) A lot of that is probably people not filling it out.  Last year, I had 12 phone interviews and something like 3 campus interviews, 4 if you count the dean vacancy I think, and I turned down an interview at bemidji after my wife realized it was up by Fargo.  I did not update it for quite a while.  THis year, I am still at zero.  This seems to be pretty typical for me.  Most of the things i apply for open up between Oct and Feb, and the first interviews are usually in Jan-Feb at the earliest for me.  Last year was an exception in that I had 3-4 before Christmas.  4) I also know plenty of TT faculty who are applying (and getting interviews) for a lot of the R1 jobs that have been posted here. The Wiki users represent a small fraction of the actual applicant pool. 5)  I think what the OP is saying is that we shouldn't be discouraged as we are mostly in the same boat, but, as usual on this page, everyone needs to pick the bones of everyone else and point out all their faults.  6) I am in the zero category too and it's been really hard to keep my energy up. It does seem that the same set of people are getting most of the interviews. I think this is why there are so many failed searches being repeated this year. You would think search committees would get wise to this and try to invite a different set if possible. Though it is not like they are in cahoots together. I just don't know if I want to bother going through this process again next year.  7)  I'm also a zero.  Haven't even made a short list this year despite about a million in grant money, loads of decent pubs, and lots of teaching experience.  I've been looking for 3-4 years and this is the first year that I've not gotten at least one phone or on-campus interview let alone not make a single short list.  Very discouraging and, yes, hard to keep up the time and energy needed to look for and apply to more jobs when it seems like the bulk of the good gigs have already moved on.  ...but, what can you do?  Just keep on keepin' on, I suppose, because what's the alternative? Staying at a job you don't like?  Running out of postdoc funding?  Working half a dozen adjunct positions?  Just gotta be the last man standing, I guess, so don't give up folks!  Rage, rage against the dying of the light, people!!  8) I feel the same way - one interview so far, and the days passing on the calendar feel like a countdown to total misery. :(  9) There used to be a ""Venting Page"". Do we need to re-establish? 10) Heck yes!",Lots and lots of rejections in the last few days. Got 4 just today (12/21/2015). Happy holidays everyone! 2) Yep. Glad the search committees get to go to vacation with clean slates but I am not feeling terribly Christmas-y this afternoon.  3) If I don't have tons of rejections today does that mean I'm having a great holiday? Or are we just in different fields? Or did my app just get lost in the ether?  4) All my rejections came earlier this month so I'm numb already. 5) Last year I got a rejection on Christmas Eve. Let's see if they will send on on Christmas Eve this year. Hope they say happy holidays this time. ,NA,#feeltheclintch,"Age discrimination and Travel This is a random thought I just had: employers are not supposed to discriminate based on age, and HR even directs interviewers to avoid the question entirely. But, when invited for an interview, I need to provide the department with my birth date in order to book a flight! I'm sure it's not really something that really causes issues, just a weird quirk of the process! 2) Airlines require a birth date when a ticket is purchased. 3) Yeah, I think you need gender to purchase plane tickets too.  Asking for birth date to buy a ticket != discimination. 4) I've worried about this when booking flights, but honestly, the search committee can probably estimate your age based on when you received your Bachelor's. 5) It's not the SC booking your ticket!  It's an admin in the front office.  Also, what #4 said. 6) I agree with what #4 and #5 said. It is not difficult to guess a person's age. Gender is not a mystery because of the reference letters (and website picture, your conference presentation video, etc). So I don't think asking birth date and gender for flight ticket is anything worrying. That said,  I have not been asked birth date twice. One is that an university asked me to book tickets by myself and reimburse me later, the other one is that the (top, rich) university outsourced a travel company to book the tickets.  7) I missed this before...Is there a Goldilocks age range for faculty hires? Are people afraid of being discriminated because they are too young or too old? 8) If you're a woman, you definitely don't want to appear too young. I think being older could be disadvantegous for either gender... 8) You must be exactly 31 years, 4 months, 2 weeks, and 6 days old at the time of your interview.  Otherwise your chances go WAY down. 9) Well that explains why I'm not getting interviews. (x2) 10) Given that PhDs and postdocs are getting longer nowadays, the average applicant age must have increased too. 11) Regardless, I do wonder if I'm 'aging out'- a bunch of positions in my subfield recently went to baby postdocs (ie people just out of the gate) and it makes us old timers worry 12) Single data point, but I got my first (and dream) TT job at the age of 39.  Although a lot of departments and institutions try to grab rising stars, others do seek experience and perspective, which correlate positively with age and/or time since degree. 13) My experience in the job market the past two years is that alot of of us older folks then to get passed over for rising stars, but there is nothing we can do about that except keep publishing papers and be productive.  14) age discrimination is rapant, especially in smaller regional state universities where the older faculty are often burned out and wish ""fresh new blood"" to drain (and dump all their work on). 15) Thanks #12 for your example. ","Today I'm completley unmotivated to do anything. Job season has been incredibly stressful and full of ups and downs. TBH, I'm only on campus because the grad students are meeting with the speaker and there is a chance I'll get some free leftover pizza. x5 on trying to steal grad student pizza 3) ghostdocs are totally allowed to scrounge free pizza, 4) At least you made it to campus. I just got back from an interview where I found out that there is an internal candidate, so I'm hiding in my apartment for the day. 5) Really sorry to hear that, #4. Im just feeling glum and also hungry today, but you have an excellent excuse 6) TIL ""ghostdoc"" 7) Another ""ghostdoc"" here, very much feeling the rollercoaster job season. Actually it was a rollercoaster early in the season. Lately it's just a f@#$ me every day.",Negotiations tab post-docs Would those individuals that posted on the Negotiations tab with a post-doc as their previous position be wiling to share if it was a research post-doc or a teaching post-doc? 2) Research with teaching postdoc for me,"Did the stupid thing of google searching the person that ended up getting the job I was interviewed for. He had 1/4 the number of pubs that I do. I know, I know. Pubs aren't everything. Obviously. Probably was just the ""better fit."" I hope one day to know what that means.  2) Fit = the sum of a bunch of subjective opinions of humans. You will never know what it means. x2 3) we're just a bunch of apes out on the savanna tossing rocks at each other 4) As someone who takes great pride in being the best educator I can be, I feel it neccesary to stand up and shout from the rooftops that number of pubs doesn't mean shit when it comes to the ability to interact with and educate young people. For me, teaching is job number one (by far)...research comes a distant second. I know plenty of people with WAY more pubs than me who absolutely suck at teaching and their students hate them. So perhaps being a good educator was the primary qualification? For the record, I'm not suggesting you aren't a good educator. I don't know anything about you or the institution you applied to. But it turns out that the ability to provide top-notch education for students (rather than pubs and grants) is still important at at least some institutions. Whatever the case, they were obviously assessing you based on criteria other than just number of pubs. 5) At R1s, I find ""fit"" usually relates to the type of research you are doing (how well it fits with other faculty, department direction, region, etc.), as (sadly) teaching is often not a major consideration for hires 6) Yes, being on the other side of this on search committees, #5 is right. Faculty are looking for a colleague and potentially a collaborator (as well as all the other stuff on a CV). If this was just about research output, then we wouldn't invest a lot of time and money into an intense 2-day interview. Most other jobs/industries don't put that much effort into interviewing. I know its tough to look at the person's CV who beat you out for a job, but it really is futile to compare on paper. 7) to #4, how does one assess whether someone is going to be a good educator coming out of a PhD program or post-doc? 8) #4 here responding to #7. I assume you mean with no teaching experience? I'm not sure. In my case I taught pretty-much every semester I was in grad school, so I had teaching evals and awards to share with folks. On top of that, I worked as a VAP for a total of 3 years (in addition to 2 years of research postdoc) before landing my first TT job. So my suggestion for people coming out of PhD and postdoc positions with no teaching experience? Get some. Better yet, get some while still in grad school. 9) Or it could be that you ""aged out"". If you have six years of postdoc and four times the papers than a person with two year postdoc, your chances are 50/50 when in competition with this person. A lot of faculty folks are looking for ""promise"" rather than ""established"". I think this is somewhat misguided, but I have seen it happen and happen again. And a six year postdoc probably have better papers than a recently associate prof who was hired five years ago when the job market is different. This person could feel ""threatened"" by the new person with a productive six year postdoc. Seen that happened too. In any case, getting the faculty job is not a prize, nor a fair game. It is usually not the person with the most number of papers/longest postdoc who gets the job. Many other factors usually come into play that are not within one's control e.g. diversity hiring decisions, current faculty member personal bias..... it is a stochastic process. Just have to apply broadly...even to positions that you don't want. It is a employer's market, not an applicant's market, given the over production of PhDs compared to the number of faculty positions. Sorry for the long vent..... 10) Totally disagree that you should apply to positions you don't want. That just bogs down the system. 11) I back #9 completely - I applied both for jobs that I wanted and ones I wasn't sure I wanted. One, in fact, I proclaimed (to my friends) I would never take, was just applying for possibility of having two offers and some leverage. Turns out I got that job - the interview was the best one I went on, in terms of me liking the dept - and I am so happy. (Incidentally, if/when my competitors Googled me, I suspect they were salty. But seriously, the indefinable ""fit"" was so clearly good during the interview.) I think it's always worth applying. 12) #9 here. Well, honestly I only want like 2 jobs on the market. If I don't get my choices, doesn't mean I should stay jobless and sulk on one corner. Applying for jobs that I don't want doesnt mean not taking the job if offered. Food on the table first. Work hard. Ideals and dreams have to take a step back in this job market. ","Postpartum interview I'm going to give birth shortly, and I have two on-campus interviews scheduled back to back starting three weeks postpartum. I have no idea what I am going to need to make this slightly more tolerable - for example frequency of breaks or access to certain facilities. Given that I am not sure it is possible to know beforehand - and they very well may make a schedule long before I have an inkling of what I may need - is there anyone who has gone through this who has recommendations about what to ask for? For example, frequency and duration of breaks in between meetings, etc.? 2) Are you bringing the baby/partner along, and are you planning to breastfeed? My answer is dependent on those :) It'll be hard but I'm sure you'll do great! 3) I am bringing my baby and partner. I'll be breastfeeding, but when on campus I'll be pumping not bringing along the baby. 4) Not to scare you, but at three weeks post partum, I was physically exhausted, bleeding, and still on mild painkillers from the stiches. I would let the administrative assistant know about your situation and ask her (most likely a her) to pass along that information to the chair of the SC. Hopefully they will grant you frequent pumping/bathroom breaks and remove any long walks across campus from your schedule. I've found other parents (especially moms) to be very sympathetic to the realities of recovering from birth and traveling with a newborn. You can do this! 5) They are aware of the situation - the first interview location had to reschedule because their original dates were from one week before to one week after my due date. They are being very understanding, but I need to know what to ask for specifically to make it survivable. 6)Search the chronicle of higher ed forums - they have some really useful tips on this situation. Good luck! 4 again) I would ask for a secure/clean place to store your pumping equipment and expressed milk, breaks every 2-3 hours for at least a half hour, and to have as many of your meetings in the same building as possible. You may want to ask for an hour long break between your last meeting and dinner to nurse your baby. Also, I had to sit on a donut at 3 weeks post partum to relieve pressure on my stiches, but YMMV. 7) Can I just say that you're a BOSS and I have a lot of respect x4 8) Last year I was still breastfeeding and I asked for time every so often, it wasn't aproblem at all. Though I found that not all bathrooms have outlets so that is something to keep an eye out for 9) You could ask to have all of your meetings in a small conference room or empty office and for the majority of people to come to YOU rather than planning on you going to them. This will really help in case you are still in pain or on movement restriction of any kind. Basically ask for anything you MIGHT need, for example, if you end up with a c-section or complications. Anything that limits how much you have to walk around, while maximizing your access to the bathroom and a place to pump (again, an empty office that is yours for the day would be ideal!) 10) Ooof. This is going to be really hard. I have several kids so I've been through it a couple of times and yes. At that point in time I would expect to need a break every 2-3 hours for at least 30 minutes. If you need some one to talk this through with you---I know it's all about annoymity here but my heart is uh..wringing for you...so let me know if you want to actually talk this out or just text, I can. I have my own interviews coming up here and I'm currently breastfeeding. I can also put you in touch personally with a friend of mine that did a campus interview after a c-section (two weeks after) AND she got the job. She's a rockstar and so are you because Moms rock. 11) Echoing 10, you're awesome, to begin with. It might also be helpful to check out where they're putting you up - hotel vs. B&B, etc., and what type of crib arrangments they may or may not have. Some hotel crib options are awful, and spending $40 on a portable crib in the town you're traveling to is sometimes worth it. Congratulations and best wishes! 12) Oh yes!  If the department allows, an airbnb with washer + dryer was critical for a recent conference and meant we could pack slightly less. 13) Thanks everyone! This is really helpful. I have asked for breaks every 2-3 hours, and I'll look into the other suggestions. The portable crib in the town I am visiting might be very important - that made me look at how huge a pack in play on the plane might be! 14) When my wife interviewed one month post-partum, someone from the department she was interviewing at lent us a pack-n-play so we wouldn't have to take one on the plane. It helped a lot. 15) If you need to bring your own crib, I would check out the Lotus crib (great for travel, much ligher than a pack and play and we have used ours a ton).  Make sure to have breaks every 2-3 hrs.  Agree on a longer break before dinner so you can breast feed.  If you can have your partner meet you for some breaks to breast feed instead of pump, do it (complete pumping at 3 weeks can decrease supply!).  I had an emergency c-section and at 3 weeks was starting to take longer walks but still really dealing with pain.  So, if you can have all meetings in one place, do it.  Also see if you can limit early mornings (breakfast at 7:30 or 8).  If you can, prep your research talk NOW as just functioning after baby is born is going to be a challenge.  If you can get a B& B type situation, take it.  Hotel noise may be extremely hard to deal with (especially trying to get an infant to sleep during the day).  The mendela sterilization bags are great - can sterilize all bottles/pumping supplies in a microwave.  Also have wipes for cleaning.  Make sure your accomidations have some sort of a fridge and micro.  Your partner will be tired having baby all day, but try to either nurse in bed and/or have partner take over at night some so you can get some sleep.  Please ask them for somewhere to pump other than a bathroom.  Use pumping time to prep for your next meetings/review your talks (or close your eyes for a few minutes).  16) How are you doing? Thinking about you.  17) Thinking about you too, OP. I admire you!!! Let us know how it went. 18) THANK YOU to the OP and to all the great responses as I'm now in the same boat and so, so grateful for the advice outlined by you wonderful wiki people! I'm a first time mom due any day this week with my first time on-campus interview being scheduled 3-4 weeks postpartum. ",NA,"single moms rocking the academic world? Is this even possible? any one out there managing high teaching/research expectations while being the sole care taker of their children? 2) I know someone who is, but she changed her living arrangements and lifestyle to pay for a nanny.   3) I've seen PhD students do it! 4) I'd suggest joining the Academic Mamas group on FB. There are definitely single moms in the group and they may have their own sub-group. It's a supportive group and has been a great resource for me when I became a mother. 5) I've seen it done with family or paid help. Seconding the FB group. I was a late joiner and was very glad I found that community. 6) Not sure if you are already in a program or just applying, but there are some universities that have really good deals on childcare run by the university for grad students. My PhD university had a child care center where students were trained for that career under supervision of professionals and if you got in as a grad student it was entirely free (though only ~half time). Other universities have very generous childcare grants based on income that might cover ~half of full time child care. Others have nothing and only super expensive childcare. School age kids is probably easier in a lot of ways because it is so much more affordable and I do know some people who have gone back into PhD programs later as single parents. Having family or really really close friends in the area who can help with childcare would make a HUGE difference. 7) Andrea Dutton got a MacArthur Fellowship last year"
"An alright offer at crappy dept./school... Just a vent: I got an offer from a crappy department in a so called ""up and coming"" school. In all honesty, they'd be lucky to have me (just my opinion).  I don't really fit in but they're ""trying"" to ""build up"" the area of research that I do in their department. Didn't apply to many schools this year but I am ready to settle down from postdocing. I hate that I have to choose this crappy position in this crappy market, but a job is a job, right, and a better salary is a plus. I can start paying off my loans.  I'm probably going to accept the offer but, starting now to plan my exit strategy. Anyone apply to positions in their 1st year as a TT position? Anyone else in the same situation? Any suggestions?  UTSA, right? Am I right? Please say I'm right so we can all move on. 2) Kind of stupid to ask but, if the department and school are so crappy, why did you apply?  I'll go ahead and answer my own question though. In this crappy market, you probably applied to whatever you could find. Hell, I did. At least you got an interview. I got completely skunked this year! I say decline the offer and wait for one from a place less crappy. I think it's the right thing to do but, what the hell do I know about this! I've never been in your position and am green with envy about it.  I'd love to be in the position to decline an offer! The little devil on my shoulder would merely love to string an SC along, negotiate, make them jump through hoops for me, and after much time, trips, money spent, and waiting around, send them a thoughtless, impersonal, and (did I mention LATE) rejection! I'd only do it if I could somehow secretly notify the other candidates (maybe on here). Again, this is what the little devil on my shoulder would do...  Good luck OP! (3) My advice...do not take a crappy position ever.  I have been there and done it, its a career killer. do another postdoc.  There are plenty of crappy people out there who want the crappy slots.  You will be miserable. 
(4) While my first response was: ""what arrogance!"", after a moment of thinking of the places to which I applied, I realized that OP is most likely right.  I have actually been rejected by places that would be lucky to have me, so in this crappy market, I would say that, except for a few schools, most places are hiring way above their league.  So, OP, you may have to take the offer, unless you have a great post-doc lined up for the next two years (since next year isn't going to be any better).  In response to your other question - applying while on your first year, you may actually want to invest in publications and grants, and start searching in your second or third year.

5) #2, you are evil.  I like it! ;-)
6) Don't do it. I agree with #3 and #4. If you have a secured postdoc, are being productive, and are not desperate, then wait for a position that you know you will not leave (at least right off the bat). If the position seems crappy now, it will be 10x more crappy when you get there.  I've been trying to leave my crappy TT position for 3 years now.  Lots of wasted time and money (mine and the dept.'s). I've had a couple of bites this year and am desperately  hoping I get an offer in coming weeks. 7) I turned down an offer last year from a ""crappy"" department and decided to post doc instead.  It would have been a career ending decision for me due to the high teaching load so I'm pretty happy with the post doc.  That being said, I turned down the position without having another job in hand, and THAT was a difficult decision.  Good luck! (8) I was offered a position this year.  This was my first interview and my first TT job offer, as well as my first year on the market (but i've had my phd for a few yrs).  I declined.  I got phone interviews elsewhere this year, but nothing else.  I don't regret it though.  I would not have been happy there, and I am trying to have a longer-term, larger perspective on this.  Though, in a few years, I may think, damn, I should have taken that job!  But for now, I am still happy with my decision.  Like # 7, it was difficult turning down. 9) I declined an offer 2 years ago from a ""mostly crappy"" department. It was a difficult decision to make but, I don't regret it by any means.  I continued on my post doc, got out some solid papers, solid funding, learned some cool techniques, and got one offer and 3 campus interviews this year, all from great departments. The person who accepted the position that I declined 2 years ago is on the market this year.  Needless to say, it's been a challenge to try to leave.  Basically, the ""mostly crappy"" department is  A LOT crappier than I was able to judge, based only on a 3 day visit.  We're actually close colleagues and again applied to some of the same positions this year!!  Well, guess who got the offer...me! I'm accepting this time and I'm thrilled! ","Boise State Zoologist For this position (and to whomever posted shortlist made), is a rejection e-mail on 2/22 the only reason you know of this?  I ask because I haven't received a rejection e-mail (yet) but also haven't been contacted about phone/campus interview either.  Anyone on the wiki get a confirmation of short list/interview status? 1) This is what they said: ""Thank you for your interest in the Zoologist position at Boise State University. We received over 100 highly qualified applications for our current opening. The search committee has decided upon a short list from which we have invited finalists for on-campus interviews. Unfortunately, your application was not among those selected. Thus, your application is no longer under consideration."" So, yeah short list...

2) OP here - first off, THANK YOU for contributing to the wiki after you got the e-mail. It would have been easy to just say, ""ah, screw it, doesn't affect me anymore."" So thanks. Second, sorry for the rejection. But third, here is what I'm a bit worried about (and I know I'll get little sympathy from the rejected). I didn't get a rejection but I also wasn't contacted for an interview. I think I'm one of those in limbo...not quite at the rejection cutoff, but not quite good enough to make the interview list. For those of you who got rejection e-mails, were you also requested (back in January) to have your references send in their letters? Has anyone else actually received a call for phone or campus interview, or are they maybe waiting to make that final list? Sorry for being neurotic.
3) I got a rejection letter, but they had not requested my LORs (x4). 4) Have not gotten a rejection letter. Also did not get a request for letters, but did get an e-mail confirming my application was received. So, not sure where that leaves me. Obviously out of the running.

5) Someone updated the campus interview column with 2/22...was this based on someone who received a call for an interview, or based solely on the rejection letter wording? If the latter, shouldn't we reserve the interview scheduled date for when there is actually positive confirmation and not just gleaned by deduction? (6) #5, reread #1 - short list and interviewees have been selected. (7)@6 - just because they wrote that doesn't mean they've actually done it yet. You must have been lucky enough to not have been lied to by a SC yet. :) (8) Geez. Yes, they contacted for an interview...
9) That's what I wanted to know.  Thanks.",NA,NA,NA,"I am on a SC this fall, the number of applicants seems pretty low (15-30 so far).  I heard some of the same from people at other institutions.  Anyone else want to confirm? 1) Wow, that is indeed odd.  A couple of year's ago searches were receiving at least 100+ applications, even for positions at lower tier, (not so popular) schools. 2) I know.  I'm just curious if this is a national phenomenon. (3) Has the deadline passed? That's when they flood in. Don't worry until then! (4)  I'm on one SC this fall. The deadline was last week.  I'm at a fairly large well known department. We received 46 applications! What gives! (5) We are conducting three searches and we currently have less than 30 applicants for the first, 40 applicants for the second, and 25 for the third and all three have been open for about 3-4 weeks now.  These positions are ""opened until filled"", so I would have thought there'd be a bigger rush to get applications in.  Note also that the good majority of the applications for all three of these positons are international.  Not sure why the numbers are so low, but, perhaps, this year it's a buyer's market.  ;) (6) My guess is that the job posting is rather narrow/specialized and/or the location of the Blow Jobs is somewhere many people don't want to live. (7) How about the fact that most of us are drowning our sorrows in an alcoholic stupor after visiting the ""Anon Quals"" tab???????? 8) I wouldn't believe what you read on the Anon Quals tab.  Re: 6's comment, I don't know if geography is important, I know of searches in very desirable places that are dealing with a low number of applicants. Re:re: then what is the specialty/area? 9) The searches are open ended, ranging from integrative bio, evolution, and ecology. (10) ???  I don't see any jobs resembling your description on the wiki. At risk of losing your anonymity, why don't you post which positions(s) you are describing. That may help generate additional applicants.11) SC chair here, our current search has generated 42 applications to date. The deadline closes next week.  I thought our search was a fluke; I've never heard of such low numbers for a search in our department, particularly in this program.  One thing to note is that the variance of ""quality"" of applicants is extraordinarily high. There are multiple mid career and even senior tenured applicants, tenure-track  asst. prof. applicants, many international applicants, and about a third of the applicants are ABD. 12) It's probably due to the fact that there haven't been this many jobs in Academic Biology for about 6 years and there were way too many applicants during prior years. Many postdocs left the applicant pool during that time and now there are tons of jobs. So now the situtation is reverse. I quite frankly am happy about this. I'm a postdoc who has been on the job market for several years and the lack of jobs for the last 6 years has been really scary. This has made my life rather difficult since I have to compete against 300-400 applicants every year. Also, many of us postdocs have been really discouraged by the lack of jobs for the last 5-6 years, so lots of people have probably left the market due to this fustration. 13) I left the market...but I'm back BITCHES! hahahaha! 14) I hope all this is true, unless I get no interviews or offers...then it would be salt in the wounds! 15) reply to 13--> i love you. 16) HAS THIS TREND CHANGED AS YOUR DEADLINES HAVE PASSED? 17) Sadly, no. Applications are trickling in. 18) SC member here: We're about to cancel a search because we could not find any suitable candidates among the very shallow pool of applicants. Seems like low applicant numbers is one issue.  Low quality of applicants seems to be another.  What gives? I'd love to hear from other SC members trolling this site. 19) This is surprising to me. The numbers below (based on the the Phys Ecol site) do not seem to indicate a large increase in the number of positions this year. Also, I can't believe that people have left the market in droves. I have my doubts that this is a trend across searches. However, I don't really know as I am job seeker and not sitting on any search committees. In my case, I am hesistant to try for a position that does not seems a good fit in the subject area. I know others apply for everything. This is my third year on the market and I still have trouble understanding what to apply for. 20) I am on a search committee at a Masters-level institution. The number of applictions is the same as in years past for us. If anything the pool has gotten better. I wonder if this ""underperforming pool"" is a phenomenon at R1 universities, where the expectations of applicants have become unreasonable (i.e., ""we cancelled the search because the applicants were unacceptable."") 21) As a job seeker, I'd love to know what positions are not getting many applications. Despite a large number of job ads this year, the number of ads that fall within my area (animal behavior / ecology) isn't very high. If there are any ""general"" searches that are not getting sufficient applications, you can always encourage job seekers on this site to apply. 22) to SC member posting comments #4 and #18: From your two comments, it appears that you have had 46 applicants for the 1 position on offer. That may be low compared to the hundreds received in other years, but the whimpering about 'shallow pool' is just lame sauce. You only have 1 position to fill. As for the 'low quality of applicants', that should probably serve to shatter your large, well known department's self image back to where it belongs. Some of these departments and SCs are now addicted to inflicting pain on such a large scale that they are all ruffled to find so few people to reject. 23) Not sure why my comment was deleted but..I found #20's comment on MS-level insititutions interesting. In my case, I am now putting most of my efforts towards MS and SLA schools. This is partly due to the fact that most of the R1 postings seem too specialized for me or out of reach (eg. Stanford). Also, this doesn't seem to be a boom year in job postings. I wish it was a job-seekers market but I am not convinced. 24) The number of specialized positions is fairly shocking this year.  I think there is a misperception among universities that there is a lot of money out there for microbiology and bioinformatics. I've heard some admins say that there are millions of NIH funds that go unawarded each year because nobody applies for it!  Maybe when most of these people fail to get tenure because they are nothing but technicians, will we ever realize the error of our ways and go back to hiring broadly trained biologists. 25) Above poster (#24) makes a good point. I seriously doubt millions of NIH funds are going unawarded. There are high quality applications in every possible nook and cranny category. I am a biologist first, but over the last two years I have picked up a lot of bioinformatics tools. I know few people coming from Computer Science, or Physics, Math and Stats who are doing really terrific biological research based on their bioinformatics chops. SCs should stop falling for the shock and awe of big data and try to hire biologists who have worked hard to develop a interdisciplinary toolbox.  26) I accidentally deleted some of these posts the other day and could not get them to re-post.  my appologies!  27) for those who felt the candidate pool was to raw, can you tell me what your yardsticks were, it would be great to know because its probably comparable elsewhere!   28) Several searches (R1) are now reporting 100+ and 200+ ; they are for faily open job descriptions at popular large schools (e.g. UNC Chapel Hill), so maybe the trend has not been realized, at least at these places. <--That or, maybe people are telling candidates they got larger sets of applicants for out-ward appearances.  I have often wondered what percentage of applicants apply to R1 vacancies as compared to other levels.  Since most jobs and most people attend a school lower than an R1 for undergrad/masters level work, I might conclude more people seek out lower levels, and play probabilities. 29) This is really shocking from an applicant view! I have applied jobs for 3,4...years, and every year burned. It was really painful, and I'm very frustrated. Is it really true more job openning this year? 30) I think it's an average year overall, if not a little below average, but if you're a bioinformaticist right now the world's your oyster!  31) #29, you have to remember that many of the job seasons over the past five years started with posted openings then mass closures w/o filling.  Last year was not like that, but huge backlog of people who had nothing to apply for.  This year, is good for the first few months, but Dec and Jan deadlines are pretty darn low.  Hopefully they will lift a little.  I have not heard of but a few delayed positions this year.  32) I'm at a MS level state school in a large city with a strong research focus and our last 3 searches have only generated about 40, 20, and 20 applicants.  Granted they are somewhat specialized searches, but I'm shocked at the low numbers in this market. But I also see large numbers on here (100-200) for much smaller or more obscure schools.  Is it possible that many applicants are just focusing their attention on less intense experiences given the huge pool of job seekers - it's just not worth your time to apply for a big R1 unless you are a superstar? 33) I am guessing (#32) that specialized searches for Master's level institutions often have few applicants. Are these numbers really low compared to past specialized searches in your dept? I know that I am not applying to large R1s (I have 12 papers, 5 1st author in some good journals eg Ecol Letters). I am trying for smaller R1s , Master's institutions and SLAs.  A question I have had is how broad does one go when applying? Are search committees willing to be more general if they do not get a pool of applicants they are happy with? I realize this is an open-ended question but I am a bit lost on what to apply for at times. 34) Answering #33: In my experience on search committees, no, they will not broaden the search. Searches are a dark art, arrived at by negotiation and arm-twisting among faculty and administrators. Any change to the search parameters is likely to offset this delicate balance of competing interests who have conceded to a particular position announcement. If a search fails, they usually just run it again and hope for better luck on the next go-around. 35) #32 here again; I'm not sure what the historical numbers were. But I'm glad that we write more focused searches (you wouldn't believe the debate in faculty meetings about the word choice!) because the pool we do get are more specific to what we are looking for.  We don't have the funds to just throw a general ad out there and see what we get - we need to address specific teaching and research needs.  I'm just still surprised at the low numbers even for these more specialized searches. 36) For #35/32.  I agree with you.  back years ago i taught at a regional, and we would send out job search ads that essentially were so broad anyone with a degree would qualify.  This was the strategy of a bad director and dean.  if you are at a big school and you are just filling a slot with anyone, you can do this, I'm not convinced it is a good way for regionals or smaller to operate. A few years back I interviewed at a school that advertised a fairly broad ad for a biologist.  i contacted the chair of the committee and was told, yes we are interested in I who can teach our intro course, sophomore course in molecular, and a senior course in an advanced area of bio.  I passed the phone interview, then got on campus.  EVERY SINGLE committee member asked me what my qualifications were to teach biochem.  Anyone could read my CV and see I never took it.  there were two interviewees, they hired the other guy who was a biochemist.  So why even bring me in? It was a pretty iritating interview because I had to reschedule another interview to go visit them as they would not give me other dates.  That, of course, led to me not getting the other job either.  grumble grumble grumble. 37) 32 here again, your situation (#36) may have been the result of a committee that had dual interests and wanted to see who they could get to fill either one.  I wouldn't necessarily think they were leading you one, but that instead you were the best of the non-biochem people. Maybe the other applicant couldn't teach a course you could. Sometimes it's just about fit and luck. They're not going to go to the expense of bringing you out if they had no interest in hiring I with your qualifications.  38) for 37, normally, I would agree with you, except that, like always, there was more to the story.  :) 39) To speak the comment about NIH money going unclaimed, that is most definitely true. However, identifying and correctly applying for these highly specific PAs takes skill in navigating the guantlet that is the NIH system. I work at an NIH-funded center and we are specifically shown how to identify these programs and craft our materials to be successful. As a result, I have decided to leave the NIH track because I don't want to be sitting at a computer all day every day for the rest of my career. ",NA,"Publication metrics on CV 1) Yup, I get the same error. Anyone know how to fix this? 2) Unfroze rows. That fixed scroll problem. I then froze just the top row.

I wonder if they request this from all the candidates.,NA,NA,"Wisconsin How concerned are peps about UW-Madison and other U Wisconsin Universities? My understanding is that they significantly weakened tenure protections for faculty last year (#FakeTenure). Maybe I am overreactive, but in the new Trumpmerica, and Scott Walker zone, could my climate change ecology be potentially viewed a a major threat to politicians. It seems ugly there right now. Any insights from WI or people in similar circumstances in other states? I have applications to a few crazy red states too. I won't get an inteview anyways, which will probably quickly solve this problem! thought it might be worth discussion though. 2) We're conducting a couple of searches at my institution and I've seen several U-Wisconsin system Assistant Professors in our applicant pools.  Make of that what you will, but I think that tells us something. 3) http://bit.ly/2iWIz4O","1) SC Venting #2.  Why are so few candidates telling us how they're a good fit for our actual job ad in their cover letter?  So far ZERO letters have addressed how they fit the one slightly quixotic thing we say we want, and virtually none have addressed several other things stated in the ad, such as their fit for the the type of students at our university.  This is cover letter 101, and so far, most applicants fail, including a couple with otherwise fabulous CVs. Tell us how you fit the ad!  2) I can understand the frustration, but coming from the applicant side - most ads are so broad and suggest so many options (evolution! development! quantitative ecology! systems biology! all together in one candidate!) that it feels impossible to figure out how you even fit. And you don't want to sell yourself too hard on one aspect (e.g. development) if it turns out the committee really wants someone who does systems biology. 3) Maybe we don’t feel like spending hours to make you feel like your students / department / sub-discipline are somehow special. x2 4) I assume you are trolling, #3. If not, good luck to you. And I feel your pain, #1. I've been on a few SC over the years and I'm always surprised at how little time many (most?) applicants put into their applications. I honestly think that part of the problem is that they don't receive much guidance. The result is that at least half of the apps most SC receive for a given job are really badly put together. Some of them are just awful. 3) Not trolling. You shouldn’t seek validation of your self-percieved exclusivity in cover letters. Also, it is hard to feel bad for you when the market for SC has never been better.  5)  ""The market for SC...""  I'm assuming you've never been on one.  It's extremely frustrating to have people waste your time with terrible applications.  If you're not going to make a decent effort, then don't submit your CV.  You're not going to get the job so you're just wasting everyone's time (including yours and your letter writers'). 6) Perhaps you should do some self reflection. If NO ONE is giving you what you want, perhaps you wrote a poor ad, eh? As to applicants not spending much time on their applications? Most of us are applying to 30+ schools. I also have two classes to teach, students to mentor, papers to write and grants due. I spend as much time as can be afforded to applications. Maybe not hours and hours on each application, but more than I'd like. X103 7) It is pretty gauche to come on an academic job board and complain about the lack of quality applicants. 3) @ 5, I have served on SCs. There has never been more PhDs in the history of the earth than now, some jobs get > 500 appplications. What exactly is your argument here? 9) Sounds like someones ego got the best of them....   5) The argument is that no one cares what the ""market is like for SC"".  Regardless of the ""market"", it's frustrating to be on a search committee when a large number of people waste your time with poorly written or irrelevant applications including form letters that do not even address the search criteria.  Of those >500 applications, how many do you think are a waste of the SC's and the applicant's time? 10) Hey if you don‘t want to do your job I would be more than happy to take it off your hands. 11) and any job that requires any review process. Basically, accademia. 12) @7) Did you miss that this is the ""Venting"" tab? 13) Seriously, stop writing vague job ads that are obvious fishing expeditions and maybe we'll do a better job. Or, actually read the applicants' CV and research statements? If cover letters have such a clear formula, then what use are they really? 14) #13, confused by what you mean about a formula-- all parts of application have  'formula' and that doesn't make any part irrelevant.  Think of cover letter this way: It is your letter of recommendation for yourself.  The formula is to say how you fit the ad. Why would you not write yourself a letter of recommendation that highlights all of the ways that you fit the ad?  The whole point is to give members of the SC ammo to help them argue that you should be on the short list, against other SC members that want to interview someone else. (also, re vague ads-- ever try to write an important document by committee?  when we claim we want physiology, -- what is physiology?  Which subfields does it include?  tell us how what you study is physiology...) 15) As a member of several SCs, I have never found it a burden if an applicant did not explicitly state how their reserach directly applied to our job ad. In broad searches in particular, we were looking for stellar candidates and were more interested in candidates who can sell themselves as excellent academics, not those who were best at pandering to our advertisement. In more targeted searches, we explicitly asked candidates to address their fit in the cover letter. Most did. If you're struggling with your duties, perhaps consider improving how you conduct your searchers. Its unfair to blame candidates for not meeting expectations you did not clearly set. 16) Thanks #15, that is encouraging to hear as a job applicant who has trouble discerning from long job ads exactlyw which criteria SCs are most interested in (amid several paragraphs of possibilities). 17) You're welcome, 16. However, I am clearly not speaking for all SC members, as the OP is demonstrating. In my department, we are explicitly instructed to read through all of the application materials before we begin any ranking process. Part of this is to eliminate (or, at least moderate) certain biases. After reading a whole application packet, I do not need to have a candidate spell out their suitability for what we're asking for. I consider colleagues and myself intelligent enough to determine that for ourselves. 18) The places I've been hav been chaired by decent people who genuinely care. #1 could politely remove their original post and take whatever venting is humanly allowed to an outlet that is not a venting page for job seekers who, by and large, have devoted themselves to a grueling task with little thanks, awful job prospects, and generally low pay, while still managing to be a very nice group of people to drink a beer with. <- I couldn't agree more. From most of us on the SC side of things, to those of you still applying: good luck, and I sincerely wish you all the best.  19* Restored deleted: [ 19) Have been a member and chair of many search committees in the last 10 years and, honestly, I primarily look at the CV. If the person ""fits"" the position, you'll know in a millisecond from the CV. It will give you their pedigree, the field(s) they have published in, how much grant money they've landed, what they've taught (if anything), and a variety of other useful information. If the CV looks good, then I go to the other materials and reference letters to help me perfect my top picks. An unreadable or painfully readbale CV or an applicant who has not accomplished much will end up in a lower tier pile right out of the gate for me. Anyone can bullshit about how they fit on a cover letter, but the proof is in the puddin' and the puddin' is what they've actually done and are capable of based on their credentials. 20) Im genuinely happy to see the number of reasonable SC members appears to outweigh the embittered ones. x4 21) well said 19. 22) Regarding guidance required to write a cover letter ""correctly"": If applicants need to know the secret handshake to apply to your department's job, you are unfairly disadvantaging candidates who don't have mentors in the know. Spell out your instructions clearly. Write out the selection criteria and ask applicants to address them. x3 23) @22 why might a job ad not have this? well, consider: my university is now requiring a ""diversity statement"" with applications. At the diversity workshop we asked the vice provost for academic personnel if we could provide some guidance as to what this is. She said no, that if everyone knew what a diversity statement was already, they would simply follow the formula and there'd be no variation in quality. I'm strongly opposed to the vice provost's view, I think guidance on what a diversity statement is should be provided since its not a standard part of the application. But that's out of our hands. 24) #23, thanks for your attempts to get some guidance, even if they were unsuccessful. For many of us, diversity statements are a big source of confusion, especially if the majority of our experience is not in the US and we're not clued in to the politics of these things. Your vice provost's opinion is especially frustrating because if there were no variation in quality, it is a meaningless part of the application and is just an exercise in box-checking. Which validates some of our general confusion/annoyance at the application process. 24) I would love for there to be an anonymous board where people could post their diversity statements from successful and unsuccessful applications. I'd love to see what is getting through and what is not. 25) fwiw, there are places that do post selected diversity statements from their faculty that could serve as a model. I think the good ones, like teaching statements, have little to no fluff, but focus succinctly on things one does and has done. 26) I started a tab under ""general discussion"".]; 27) #1 The answer is simple. Smart candidates these days paly the numbers due to the lack of jobs. Even top candidates have a low probability of landing interview on a single job, so the best strategy is to apply to as many jobs as posible. This year I applied to 70 jobs, resulting in 5 interviews. Was I going to personalize cover letter for each? Hell no. And given that is very hard to know what many job descriptions actually mean, I still try broadly. So please, try to understand the applicants these days who have to deal with a horrible job market.","Department letterhead Should I be using my university / department's letterhead in my cover letter? Google is giving me like 50/50 on this issue.  2) Yes!  3) To me it doesnt matter. A nice list of publications or a well written research statement matters more. (x3) 4) Yes. 5) Soooo, let's say I don't have either of those.... 6) Yes if its going to schools in the United States, No to letters being sent outside the US, where letterhead is often only used for 'official' university business 7) OP: Thanks for the info! 8) I would use letterhead to Canadian Institutions 9) Having served on search committees and seen applications without letterhead always gave me concern as if the applicants were unemployed or did not want to associate themselves with their current institution. It also made me work to find out where they were currently employed. So, I'd certainly use it. If you don't have access to one, make one yourself that's close enough to the real thing. Usually universities have a website with downloads because they like their employees to use uniform letter head, various seals and insignias and even formats for poster presentation, i.e., participate in the corporate identity.   10)  I've also been on SCs (in Canada).  Definitely use letterhead of your current institution.  And be sure to print the cover letter with the letterhead in colour. 11) In Australia, it doesn’t matter  The vast majoriy won’t care. Of those who do, half would see it as a misuse of official letterhead; the other half would expect it if you have an affiliation.","What happened to the previous post few weeks ago that was talking about suing a school for racial discrimination.

Thanks! 4) I add them in advance. Shows that I have stuff going on. x6 5) I will not add that stuff while I'm an active candidate. I don't want SCs for jobs I'm applying to now (backups) to know I've got a bunch of interviews lined up and not fully consider my application. 6) I disagree with 5; to me, it would only signal that you're a desireable candidate and worthy of interviewing. I can't imagine a SC using an active list of invited seminars as the basis to toss an application.  7) I did not put the interviews themseleves as if they were invited talks.  I think those are very different things.  If you do have a real semniar or conference talk (not an interview) then I list them as Bioengineering Dept Seminar, Podunk University, Nowhere USA, Upcoming.  June 2019.   8) ROFL @ a job talk not being a ""real seminar!"" Please explain how an interview doesn't count as an invited seminar. It's irrefutably more difficult to be invited for a job seminar than it is to an organized conference session or regular departmental seminar, since it's not friends, collaborators, or members your small research subdiscipline doing the inviting. You got invited there over hundreds of others based on a consensus from strangers who want to hear about your work.

"Advice for post-offer campus visit? This question is somewhat directed at TT faculty who are looking to leave their current positions.

I am mainly interested in scoping out space, equipment, etc... but for you TT profs, is there anything in retrospect you wish you'd known about your offer? Did it seem great or were you ""meh"" from the get-go? Thanks! 1) I am working on starting offer negotiations (and likely a second visit) and am interested about this too. I am amazed how unwilling some of my past mentors are to help me with figuring out a) how much money I reasonably need to get started and b) how to negotiate. (2) This is the OP -- totally agree! There is also a disconnect in my case between my R1 postdoc advisor and the M/L where my offer is. The advice from my PI has not necessarily been applicable. I also tend to value things (e.g., collegiality, location) that he does not prioritize. (3) #1 again. Type of community and type of department are very important to me. I keep getting advice that is very biology centric and may not apply to departments not used to large start-up budgets (even if they are R1). Hopefully we can get some helpful advice! 4) I'm a TT faculty and part of the difficulty of giving advice on this is it depends in part on what you do and what kind of university you are negotiating with. The most useful info is the page on this site where people post what type of university and what start-up they've negotiated. Things that people sometimes can get in their startup that are useful (for an R1/high R2 university) that are distinct from the equipment/supplies you need: postdoc (these are extremely helpful in keeping papers coming out of your lab while you are busy ordering and preping your first classes, summer salary for you (not all places will do this), travel money (both for research and for conferences). Ask if renovation money is separate. If not, you may need to budget for that. You may also need to budget for furniture for your office and lab (do not underestimate how expensive a chair is!!). Let me know if you have specific questions and I'll answer if possible. (5) #4 - Thanks! I know it is hard and all relative, but it is very difficult to figure out how to do this. Your comments are helpful and much appreciated!

(6) One of the things that surprised me is that you don't just get a pot of money, it can come in different flavors. Ask about when startup will become available, when it will stop being available, are there any restrictions on how it can be spent, etc. It can depend on where the money is coming from (university foundation, state accounts, etc). For employees on my startup, the university picked up the fringe benefits (good deal). At a previous institution, startup couldn't be used for travel unless originally budgeted for travel (bad deal). So ask the chair and other recent hires if they ran into any money issues. (7) This is the OP -- thanks everyone for your thoughts! This has been really helpful. I never would have thought to ask about furniture, and definitely want to clarify any restrictions on how the startup can be spent... thanks again!","Deleted stuff For future reference, you can retrieve deleted stuff by using ""See revision history"" in the file menu.

Nothing personal.,NA,NA,"Ratio of genders hired Just looked back at last years wiki and a majority of offers on the negotiations page were listed by females. Is this a trend of more females being hired or are females more willing to list? Curious as to other thoughts on this... 1) I'm going to guess that females are more likely to post their info because they found it helpful.  I've interviewed for 5 positions and I believe 4 of them went ot male candidates (obviously not a huge sample). 2) N=2 now. I've interviewed for 5 as well, and 4 ALSO went to male candiates. The plural of anecdote is DATA!  3) I interviewed for 2 positions last year. One went to a female candidate and one went to a male candidate. 4) I interviewed for 5, 4 went to females, 1 went to a male. 5) Male commenter here, currently applying for jobs - All I can say is that if more jobs are going to females, good. Departments are still WAY unbalanced as far as faculty genders go. Even though I want to be picked over all other candidates :-), there needs to be more balance in academia. May the best candidate win, regardless of sex, but a little help to balance the ratio among faculty is fine. 6) Best candidate should be picked regardless of gender - that should be the goal. 7) 'Best Candidate' could mean a lot of things depending on the department - they might have a goal to diversify their department, or some other ideas in mind. How do we rank 'Best?' any ways, if not by what a department is actually looking for in a candidate 8) Well...I have to admit it does seem like there is advantage to being a F right now. Established/tenured F candidates especially have a far expanded ability to pick and choose. 9) I've closely followed an E&E hire at an ivy recently, they explicitly put the effort into bringing 1:1 M:F candidates to interview as part of the effort to diversify the department. Ended up hiring a dude though. 10) I saw the same pattern mentioned by #9 for the places I was interested in. 11) Of the two EEB departments I've been in, over the past 5 years of searches they've hired a total of 8 faculty, only 1 of which was a woman. Both departments *said* they really wanted to hire women, but the ""best"" candidates were men. At the same time, I watched them elimnate a woman from consideration bc she was not ""really an ecologist"" but instead hire a man who studied geochemical methods and applied them to ecological questions - in my mind, less of an ecologist than the woman. I've watched them decide to not interview women for assistant prof positions bc they were ""too young"" or ""inexperienced"" on their CVs, despite being VERY strong for their career stage (1-2 years of postdoc), and end up hiring men only a year or two older. There's still a LOT of subconscious bias going on. Hell, I had a full prof tell me it was not bias to rank women lower than ""equal"" men because you have a priori knowledge that women are more likely to take time off to have babies (yes, he seriously tried to justify illegal discrimination with Bayesian statistics). Anyone who thinks there is an actual benefit to being female in this job market is unfamiliar with the current research on subconscious gender bias and hasn't paid attention when listening to search committees justify their choices. X4 and also ::snaps: 12) Some of the items mentioned by 11 seem actionable. Has anyone been in a position where they were able to report discrimination or inappropriate behavior? 13) 11 here. I was a grad student when I witnessed this stuff, so no, I was not in a position to report any of it. Most of it is subconscious and not actionable. The comment by the prof about it being ok to discrimnate against women because babiez was made in a general context, not with respect to any particular search, so I don't think it is even actionable, b/c I can't prove that his attitude changed the outcome of any specific hire. 14) I just had an interview where M:F was 4:1 (they hired a man). 15) Would love to see a hard study/data on this issue. After awhile in the academy, I feel as though I have seen both ends of the spectrum and think they both occur, sensu self-selection. Tough tough issue and no easy solutions. 16) Recent asst. prof. hires in ecology and allied fields are gender balanced: https://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2016/11/29/a-bit-of-good-news-that-most-ecologists-werent-expecting-recent-ecology-hires-are-gender-balanced/ 17) Interesting. Good news. The bimodality of the poll data is intriguing.  18) outside of the reduction in the number of bigots over time, there are more women in science, hence more of the subset of qualified women, hence more of the subset of super-competitive women, hence, more women hires.  Its that simple. ","2017, you're the worst.

I had the impression during interviews that folks were generally happy and collaborative, but that's not the case and I'm keeping a close eye on job postings. If I get another interview somewhere else in these next few years: how do you know what the department dynamic is really like?? Is it just a ""you don't know until you go"" situation?  2) This could be difficult to do in some situations, but I would try to contact people who have recently (within the last 5 years) left the department, and ask them about why they left.  They're much more likely to give you an honest opinion. (x2) 3) That is a great idea, in general, do you find that smaller departments are more toxic and dysfunctional than larger ones? 4) Not necc. more toxic, but much more problematic if they are. Can be worse if small program + off-campus.  5)  How do you find folks that have left?  6) I am in a very similar situation, #1 and currently wondering how to change env't here vs. get out; both a lot of effort and no guarantees other dept would be any better. This was the place I felt least cynical about during the interviews a few years ago, but some red flags I should have given more weight to... I guess most specifically how everybody managed to ""get along"" without talking much to each other - no real mechanisms for communication in place   7)  Also in a toxic work situation and have been looking to get out for the last 5 years or so.  I think it's taken me this long to find another gig, because I'm not desparate and want to make sure I end up somewhere better, so I've been very picky.  If you are off on an interview, now that you've been in a toxic place, you can get a feel for warning signs and can read folks.  I also ask candid questions, as not only are they interviewing you, but you are interviewing them.  Some tell me that the grass isn't any greener, but I tell them the grass sure as shit can't be any browner and to fuck off. ;)  It's my sanity that needs to be maintained, not theirs. 8) Well said #7. What are some of the types of questions you like to ask while you're on campus? 9) to #7 put a smile on my face. After 5y I'm guessing you may have tenure (or feel good about the tenure package)? that might affect ability to nagivate a toxic environment - I'm not sure it's a good idea for me to say that to my colleagues 10)  #7 here, again, when on an interview, I found it best to not ask chairs, deans, provosts, etc. about department dynamics, as they all lie and I've had one dean get angry that I even asked.  I usually reserve those questions for the faculty that seem to be more laid back.  You will typically meet with some faculty on an individual basis and I can usually read which ones are stuffy and which ones are more open to a wide array of questions and I ask them if there are any primadonnas, any cliques, biases, etc.  ","Seriously struggling to get motivated for job season... just... blech. (2) Same. Just. Same. x8 3) ditto. I'm so spent already, semester doesn't even start for 2.5 weeks","Too many publications? I've heard some people suggest that having too many publications listed on CV could hurt applicants in some cases. For instance, say you have 30+ publications but many are not first-author and they cover a pretty wide range of topics. Could it actually look better to only list 10-15 that are all directly relevant to the job add and that are mostly first authored? I guess I can see how having the full list could be a bit distracting in seeing the fit for a position, but it seems really strange to me to leave off publications that are at least somewhat related to a job and are in good journals. Has anyone actually done this? And, if so, do you list the articles that stay as 'selected publications' or just leave some off entirely? 2) I'd keep them all on there but just highlight the relevant ones in the research statement. You could also separate them out by authorship in your CV. 3) Gosh, I think the more pubs the better, if your non-first author pubs are on various topics - it shows you have a method or skill that is widely applicable. I like #2's suggestion of listing 1st authored papers, and then non-first authored papers. 3) I list them all but (they are 30+) but first list the KEY PUBLICATIONS and the the OTHER PUBLICATIONS. 4.) I give up. 5) Alternative take: if you are in the unfortunate position of having 30+ publications, then don't list any of them on your CV and just write a link to your researchgate (not Google Scholar) profile. 6) I have more than 30 and I just list them all (you could have a summary of your work before you list them if you want to give them a quick run-down). Different committee members will be looking for different things from your CV and I'd worry that leaving things out means they won't be seen by someone that is perusing 100 CV's (while clicking a link is easy, it doesn't mean they are going to do it for every single applicant). I could see a case to append your CV if you are applying for a job as an Associate or full professor and you didn't want them to spend a bunch of time looking at your stuff decades prior, but would generaly leave it in otherwise. You could break it down by section, number, etc. but I think a simple chronological order is acceptable and fast to get through rather than sections (for me ""book chapters"") with one article. 7) One option for future applicants would be to avoid the problem of watered down CVs by not working with people or labs that give out authorship like candy. Have some standards people. 8) #4 What is special about researchgate/what is bad about google scholar? I don't use researchgate or linkedin... is that bad for me? x2 9) I would consider leaving publication off of your CV as being dishonest. To my mind your CV is suppose to be the record of your academic career and it is improper to be editting it. I do realize however that we don't put everything in there, but I think would be dishoest to edit the big items like where you've been employed, where you got your degrees, what classes you taught, publications, and funding. 10) It is definitely not dishonest to leave publications off, especially if you list the section as 'selected publications' or something. I have been told that I should consider doing this from a search committee member for a position that I had applied for and who sat through the discussions. So whatever you think about it, there are at least some people on search committees who look on too many publications (especially thinking here of too many collaborative/co-authored pubs) as a negative thing even if they come with the same total number of first authored publications. 11) I can only say that I (a search committee member) want a CV to be complete and not the selective highlights of your career. I agree it's not dishonest if it says ""select"", and I also agree that you can't please everyone, which makes the whole thing a frustrating guessing game for applicants. But, I do maintain that a CV should be a complete record. x3 10) @11, I don't necessarily disagree with you, but what are we supposed to do with conflicting desires of different committee members? I was specifically told that this came up in discussion of my application by the committee and hurt my chances for a search last year... 12) 11 again, I'd suggest get more opinions perhaps mine is not typical 13) Ugh. I find sentiments like #7 just...ridiculous. I have a whole bunch of 2nd author publications where basically I did the statistical analysis and the lit review for a project someone else designed and implemented, and then we wrote it together. We're told for years to collaborate in multidisciplinary groups, and then we get penalized for actually doing so? I knew there were established professors who felt that such collaborations were a bad idea, but hearing it echoed in the upcoming set is discouraging. 14) @13, why are you spending your time as 2nd fiddle? Aren't you trying to show you can lead research? 15) 14, Did you even read their comment? For those that are statistically savvy, fairly common to crank out statistics for someone else's paper. It's a bonus, not 2nd fiddle. I have several myself, and a half dozen acknowledgement mentions for the same. 16) #15 it may be 'common' for some, but can you actually be 'disgusted' by people not being impressed with a slew of 2nd authors?? Professors are hired to lead research programs, lead research grants, lead up-and-coming scientists, not do other people's statistics 17) Actually professors can be quite happy to have a skilled ""statistician"" that can help improve their work and their inclusion on grants can help get those grants funded. In better circumstances that person is also involved in the experimental design and not ""just"" doing stats. Departments aren't just driven by pub numbers, but also by the good feelings of working together. 18) This thread is really discourgaing. Some people are so judgemental. We are all different, and our strengths lie in different places - I don't see having some second author papers as a failure in any way. I don't think being second author on a manuscript means you are unable to lead a research program. This is nuts to me. 19) Hopefully just one person. 20) I find that those who hold sentiments like those expressed in #7 are also those who are the first in line asking to be added to a nature/science paper along with 65 other co-authors because they made a ""significant contribution"" 21) Agree!! As long as you're not always middle author and shape your own projects too, where's the issue? 22) I find it funny that people make the level of assumptions they do about these things. The fact that someone has a lot of 2nd author publications doesn't mean that they don't also have a substantial number of 1st author publications. There's also a basic reality check. If person A and person B collaborate over multiple publications, unless one of them is the PI of the lab the other is working in, it's really unlikely that either of them should be the 1st author every time. And since this thread is about people being penalized for having too many publications, there's clearly a difference between someone thinking that a committee should be impressed by a lot of 2nd author papers, and someone thinking a committee shouldn't judge them as worse for having those 2nd author papers than not having those papers at all. 23) Restoring this discussion 24) ugh - going between this and the ""time to give up"" discussion above. i had a committee chair explain that the simple reason for rejection was based on my lack of publication quantity. wasn't a surprise and I'd love to have this opposite problem!",NA,"Average negotiation time I was wondering how long negotiations last before having a formal offer? I'm sure it varies and I'd like to know for how long folks have negotiated back and forth 2) It depends. At my current university I was only given a week, but I was able to push for two weeks because I had other interviews. At the place I'm applying now, they're much more flexible, especially as the holidays are coming up. 3) do you mean ""formal"" offer or ""final"" offer? In my experience, I got a formal (in a written letter) first, and then started to negotiate, and then this formal offer got updated as negotiations went on. Negotiations can last for anything from a few weeks to months (2 months in my case) depending on what is being negotiated and how long it takes for higher-ups to get back to you. 4) I got an offer a few days after my interview and was initially given one week to answer. I stretched that for a little while longer with additional questions and negotiations (mostly waiting for responses). 2.5 weeks. I am not at a place where I could have asked for anything very big though, and I can imagine figuring those details might take longer. 5) I was told upfront that negotiations were expected to be wrapped up in about 2 months, YMMV 6) Mine all took multiple months but involved interviewing my spouse and trying to find a position for him 7) my experience (at an R1) was the opposite of #3: the written letter came *after* the informal negotiations, and they wanted an exact equipment list before information negotiations could start.  Whole thing took roughly 2 months. 8) Between a job offer and when they asked me to sign a contract at one uni was 3-4 weeks (with the negotiating in the middle) and the job I took didn't seem in a hurry- maybe 6 weeks? A friend was given less than a week to decide (inlcuding negotitations!). Not a good sign in my opinion. "
"A pattern at UoP? As some of you may know, UoP also advertised for a Vertebrate Ecologist in the Fall of 2008. How does the current search (Fall 2009) relate to the earlier search? Did they want another vertebrate ecologist? Did they lose or not hire one from the 2008 search? Is the failure of the current search related to the earlier search? 1) The 2008 search was successful, this was apparently a new search 2) To 1 - if they hired a vertebrate ecologist in 2008, why would they need another one (in a fairly small department)? (3) One was denied tenure, the other left for personal reasons (4) I think this search was to replace the person that left for personal reasons (to my understanding they never actually started at UoP). They had an ecologist start Fall '09 and that individual does good work and is still at UoP. As a result of the tenure failure and this failed search they basically have two open ecologist/evo-biologist positions. From conversations I'm inferring that they are unlikely to be filling either of those positions with people that work with mammals or birds in the lab due to facility restrictions or that primarily do field work. That creates a fairly narrow window for applicants, I suppose molecular and physiological ecologists (taxonomically restricted) are what they're therefore primarily looking for. In all likelihood they'll also have a third opening in the next couple of years as they have one faculty member toward the end of his career who currently has limited involvement in either teaching or research. (2) It starts getting clearer - I understood that initially they wanted a vertebrate ecologist who does field work, so this may be what led to this failed search. BTW - those who were interviewed what was you (very general) research direction? (6?, also three above) Despite the fact that the applicant was supposed to teach field ecology, I think in the end they didn't really want someone who would be doing a lot of field work. They seemed to place a lot of emphasis on having people busy *in* the lab, if that then is combined with restrictions on what animals you can bring into the lab (e.g. no birds or mammals despite that being what they advertised for) then I'm not sure where that leaves things. I'm an evolutionary ecologist, primarily behavioral ecology and population ecology with a smattering of quantitative genetics knowledge, and work with mammals. (3) I got a phone interview, and after all this drama I am kind of thankful I did not make it to the campus interview! I am a behavioral ecologist who studies birds in the field with a little molecular lab work thrown in. (4)  I totally disagree, I landed a campus interview there on the last round...I would have killed to get that job.

2009 median # applicants = 136, quartile range = 87-250, range = 50-457
2008 median # applicants = 100, quartile range = 70-200, range = 36-800
2007 median # applicants = 100, quartile range = 59-130, range = 32-350
This means that the median # of applicants is 36% higher than previous years for which we have records, and the low threshold is 56% higher than previous years.  That sucks! Nice work OP - thank you. Would you mind throwing in the sample size for each year? (2) sure
2009 = 25 reports, 2008 = 16, 2007 = 18.  By no means a large sample, but no worse than some of our field work!!! (3) Why any one reads anything into self reporting on this wiki is beyond explanation.  This resource has become more well known and active over the years.  We are all scientists here (hopefully).  Why people don't see the limitations of this is again beyond explanation.  I'm happy that it soothes the hurt, but really, it can't be considered by any measure to be representative of reality even when it coincides with your perceived reality. (4) I concur with 3. Along the same lines, the same OP gives out job trends (# positions advertised by year) based on what is posted to the Physiological Ecology web site, assuming there is no bias to job postings by year on that particular web site. Smoke and mirrors but whatever turns your crank.  (5) actually, having posted the numbers, you can't assess whether or not these have any bearing on reality.  I was simply pointing out what the records said.  Otherwise, I don't really care if it is or isn't reality, it was just interesting to see that the numbers seemed to coincide with what is generally expected in a year like this one.

(3) the request is to use initials - I assume they will not google the person; there is a study that says that women were rated lower than men with an identical cv  (4) should have gender removed too. (5) There must be some nasty politics in that place for them to take extreme measures, which are nothing more than tokens.

Maybe we should just not submit anything for a job application because that will just identify the characteristics of the applicant.  Just an email address that hides the applicant's name.  8) This is silly. You cannot redact this stuff (publications, letter writers) It must be something to cover their asses.

I'm working on an application for a job that states, ""We seek a diverse applicant pool for this position, including women, members of underrepresented minority groups, veterans, persons with disabilities, and the LGBTQ community."" My name strongly sugests I am a woman (as do pictures if you search for my name), but putting my sexual orientation (asexual) or any other minority status in the application seems very risky! Plus, I do like to keep some separation between work and private lives. Thoughts? 2) I think that if they are seeking to increase minority representation, mentioning this might work in your favour to a small degree; it is very unlikely to hurt. But wanting to maintain your privacy is completely understandable, and this is unlikely to be the deciding factor in whether you are interviewed. 3) (1 again) This is also in a state where people can be fired because of their sexual orientation, although it does look like there are protections for state employees (and it is a public university). 4) several friends put it in their teaching statment. ""As a homosexual male, I understand the challenges of LGBTQ students...."" It doesn't define you but it addresses diversity specifically.  I hid all info during my own job search.  I don't think it's anyone else's business. 5) remember that if hired, your application materials become part of your file.  If you can be fired for sexual orientation, might be best not to mention it exactly as such in your app.  You could instead say that you're in a good position to contribute to diversity with the LGBTQ community on campus without mentioning your actual status.  At my campus, we require a diversity statement in our apps, but it's 100% about how the candidate *fosters* diversity, not how they themselves are diverse. Meaning, a white hetero male could have the best diversity statement! x3  6) Not saying there isn't reasonable cause for concern... but does anyone know an EEB faculty member who was fired for sexual orientation?  I thought most universities (even those in more conservative states) have implemented basic protections for LGBTQ faculty. 7) I wouldn't read too much into such a statement in the job ad: it's just boilerplate to check off some internal university boxes.  I agree with 6) that it's unlikely that any EEB faculty member is being fired over sexual orientation.  However, I wouldn't include such info in my application, unless it was directly relevant to the job.  The most likely negative outcome is that people will wonder why you're bringing up your personal life in a professional context, unless you do a very good job tying it into the job requirements, as 4)'s friends do. 8) I am a gay white male, and my diversity statement highlights my work with the LGBTQ+ community and the programs I would plan to encourage LGBTQ+ students to pursue STEM careers. I've also been asked in Skype interviews how I might contribute to or foster diversity, and I out myself, as awkward as it can be.

Hello all, I see a similar post below, but I am hoping some could share their opinion on this matter. I finished my PhD almost 3 years ago, completed a 1-year postdoc at an Ivy League institution, and I am currently finishing my second postdoc at a Tier 2 university. To be honest, I have hated being a postdoc, my current and previous labs are conducting research that I have absolutely no interest in, nor pursuing once I am finished. On the other hand, I absolutely love my Masters and PhD work, and I have maintained a very strong collaboration with my PhD advisor, and others in this field, and we have continued to publish together since I graduated. Currently, I have 21 manuscripts, 13 as first author, and 8 of these manuscripts have come post PhD. Of those 8, 7 are in collaboration with my PhD advisor. I also have a handful of manuscripts in preparation from this current postdoc position, so it is not a complete bust. I currently have 25-30 faculty apps out (all for Tier 2, 3, or SLAC institutions), and am also considering trying to find another postdoc that is more in-line with my long-term career goals. Assuming, however, nothing works out I am considering taking an adjunct position at a community college in the same city where I completed my PhD to continue this collaboration with my old advisor, and importantly, focus my efforts on research I actually enjoy. Although teaching adjunct at a CC would not be ideal, I wonder how it would look to search committees to have an application from someone that is making their money at a community college but remains active in the lab and continues to publish a handful of papers a year? Albeit in the same lab I completed my PhD work. Many many thanks in advance! 2) This could potentially be read as lack of scientific independence from your old advisor X2. 3) Adjunct teaching at most CC pays so poorly you will have to have another source of income if you want to have time to do research. There's also the the lack of access you may have for important resources (like finding pay-walled journal articles, paying publication fees, lack of health insurance from adjunct work, etc.). My personal view is that you should pursue exactly what research you want and not give a rip about the group you do it with, but you'd probably have more time to do that in a postdoc role than in an adjunct teaching gig. If you just need to pay bills, there are other avenues that pay far more, and you could negotiate an affiliate status with your old research group to give you institutional access. 4) I completely agree with #3. I see #2's point, but being on an SC myself I think the independence issue is vastly overrated, particularly if you are leading the charge on your work, especially given the duration of your scientific career and demonstrated potential. With >20 papers and over half of them first-authorships, you should be a very strong candidate in my book. I see on-campus invites going to folks with really mediocre records (<10 pubs, not much $), but who have hopped around a bit, and I cannot, for the life of me, fathom why that is more desirable than someone who simply found their path as a grad student and continues to kick ass. 5) I've seen people rejected for hanging around the same PI for too long, and others face-plant after becoming independent, despite the fact that they looked good on paper as postdocs. Tallying up numbers without knowing the subfield and journals probably isn't that informative by itself.6) Also if you have tons of papers but minimal authentic teaching experience, it may be tricky to land a SLAC interview, as you may come off as using them as a stepping stone to somewhere ""better"" 6) SLACs are hiring applicants that are already APs and VAPs. They are not hiring research postdocs. If you want a teaching gig, you need a massive amount of teaching experience. Get a VAP or teaching postdoc for that, any only adjunct if it is in addition to your postdoc. 7) Plenty of SLACs are hiring postdocs-- based on the Negotiations page so far. [or VAPs Asst's don't update that page, but still, it's not like no postdocs get hired at SLACs!] And postdocs are a great deal-- we have so little negotiating power! ",NA,"Major Grant I'm looking at the Anon Quals tab, and I see that many people have one or more grants over $100,000 as postdocs. I'm funded through my faculty mentor's grant, so I am not one of those people. I'd like to ask what grants people are able to get as PIs at the postdoc stage. Are folks reporting the NSF postdocs, or NIH fellowships? What else? 2) They are reporting things like NSF postdocs and GRFPs, I'd guess. At my institution, postdocs can have PI status on a standard NSF grant, but this rule varies by university. 3) folks also frequently exaggerate their role on grants they had little to do with 4) Yeah, lots of lying on applications in the grant department. ""Oh, I was a student when my PI got a big grant...looks like I'm co-PI!"" Happens all the time. 5) I reported an NSF GRF. 6) #5, as you should have. And enough people know what those are to evaluate them. 7) #4 (or anyone) what about when you are actually co-PI as listed on the grant after writing and budgeting the grant? Say as a research scientist who is not allowed to have a full independent grant due to their title at their institution? Does it look somehow fishy to write co-PI if that's the actual position on the grant? (sorry if this is a dumb question... I don't get why we would doubt the co-PI designation in the first place). 8) Yes, if you are a Co-PI or contributed to the writing of the grant, I would def. include that on your CV. If you were hired on an existing grant, then I would not list that as a personal award. 6) Ooo--I get to add my GRF to that?  7) Yes, you can do anything you want here. 8) Just be as clear as possible about your role on grants; I was on a search committee where somebody over-represented their role on their CV, and while it wasn't disqualifying it was definitely part of the discussion 9) Huh.  I did not list that I had one, and I had an NSF GRFP.  I figured it was limited to things like R01s or F32s or the like where you're a listed PI or co-PI.  I have some grants from a local source where I'm listed as a PI or co-PI, but none of them individually are over $100k; my highest individual other than the GRFP was ~$89k. 10) I'm one of those people- I contributed a lot to the grant and was made affiliate faculty so I could serve as a Co-PI (though still a postdoc) 11) Sounds like #10 is another case of a PI breaking rules to give their postdoc an edge over competition 12) @11 it doesn't sound like breaking rules to me-- plenty of universities allow their postdocs to have PI status for grants (including mine) @11) Um I wrote a big chunk of the grant, it's for a research network that I am running now and will help run whereever I end up. The snarky rule-breaking comments don't help anyone. I became affiliate faculty so I could submit multiple other grants of my own as a PI, not to game the friggin' job market.  13) I was a co-PI as a PhD student, and I think rightly so. My advisor changed universities and I was able to write and manage our $280k grant as a student. That opened me up for co-pi status as a new post doc. 14) @12 & @13 - you should be asking yourselves ""if I wasn't my supervisor's student, would I be on this grant?"" If the answer is ""no"", you and your supervisor are gaming 15) OR @14 you could ask youself ""Did I contribute substantially to the development and writing of this grant'? If the answer is ""yes"", then go ahead and sleep soundly and ignore other peoples snarky comments. 16) 13 here, my supervisor didn’t have any expertise related to my PhD grant, he learned quickly about my study species (which was new to him). But collaborators in our field approached me about pursuing the grant based on my MS work. So it was very much a joint writing effort- I had the ecological background, my advisor had grant writing expertise and technical knowledge. This was somewhat common at my R1 university. Once you had a MS supervisors treated you as a colleague, which included approaching PhD students for involvement on grants. I agree with @15 that the contribution is what counts. We have a responsibility as students and advisors to be collaborative, and shift the culture of science away from concepts like ""gaming the system"" and to being thinking about what is 'true'. This Includes acknolwedging students as PIs (or post docs) when they have the expertise to do so; this should be encouraged. I’m fortunate to have had a progressive and non competitive advisor (I can’t hold a handle to his success, I’m no threat), and I came in with some ecological background that he lacked so he had every reason to trust me. I’ll emulate this with my own students. Independence and respect go a long way toward doing what we are intended to do: which is to learn about this vast natural world. 17) at many European institutions (or at least mine) postdocs can be solo PIs on their own grants, both large and small, no problem. In fact, one can leverage a permanent job in europe this way, for example by using an ERC grant as leverage to get a permanent position (assistant professor equivalent) at the hosting university. I realize this is not common in North America, but the point is I don't think it's neccisarily appropriate to assume someone is 'gaming' the system or exagerating when they list themselves as PI on a grant at the postdoc stage. But that said, I dont doubt there are some out there that exagerate their role, which is a shame",NA,"Negotiations Tab AP) I finally got around to putting up the Negotiations tab.

And to be honest, its frustrating enough not to get interviews but to feel like I'm losing out to folks with little maturity is even more frustrating.  Maybe I'm just getting old but I don't understand why all the snide remarks and poor word choice. Maybe the posters think its funnny, but the wiki is like email - tone is hard to interpret.

I just finished my first ever on-site interview and I was the first one to be interviewed. I can't help but look at who other candidates are - they all seem to have really shiny CV. I am having a hard time staying positive (or should I not?). Thanks!! 2) how do you know who the other interviewees were? either way, stay positive....it is often about ""good fit"". Who knows what that means when you get a room full of faculty together. from 1) I found them out through their seminar schedule (and the department listed them as ""job candidate seminar""). 3) As someone who has served on several SC (and chaired one) and who has interviewed for more than a dozen jobs over the years, I can promise you that it's not worth getting yourself worked up over who the other candidates are or what their CV's look like. There are so many factors that go into the hiring process. That awesome-looking candidate with the shiny CV might be an asshole and not be offered the job for that reason. Or they might be offered the job and not accept it because they were offered a better one. Or any number of other possibilities. All you can do is do your best and then hope for the best. 4) agreed, definately don't worry about the other candidates (can't do anything about that!). You made the shortlist, got good experience meeting people and interviewing. Just kick back, relax and hope for the best. If it doesn't work out with this job, you are competitive (ie. getting interviews), so it's just a matter of time. 5) Writing papers and having fun doing science. 6) I am in the same boat that you are #1 (first interviewed, and know other candidates) I asked a friend who has been sitting in many committees in the past two years and he said as a CM it is very difficult to know who will get the offer before the discussion takes place. A number of factors come are raised in the discussion, so you really never know until you know.

I came back to report that I was recommended for hire and should be receiving an official offer soon :) peace out haters! lol,NA,"Lack of diversity This is just an observation, but 100% of people who have reported in the Annon Quals section are white. Are we 100% white people here? One explanation could be selective reporting, but I'm concerned that by virtue of the way this link gets shared (person to person among friends) that it may be less likely to fall into the hands of POC if it starts off as a pretty low diversity group. Thoughts? 2) I'm operating under the assumption that non-white people are underrepresented enough in our field that the Anon Quals wouldn't actually be anonymous for them. Thus they are probably less likely to add to the Anon Quals (and reasonably so) 3)(OP) A sensible explanation, but hard to verify 4) I am a POC, I have not added my info exactly because of what #2 says. Even though everyone I know, knows that I am applying for jobs, I find it uncomfrotable for colleagues to know exactly how many places I applied to and how many rejections I got. Idk, maybe I'm being over sensitive but I am the only POC (of my gender+ethnicity+career stage) I know in my area and I know at least 10 of my colleagues who are active in this wiki and it would be easy for them to identify me. Maybe they don't care, idk, but just in case, I'm not putting my info in the annon quals yet. Also, I don't have any POC colleages in my area who are in the job market :( so whenever I share this wiki is usually to white colleagues 5) I am white (race) and Hispanic (ethnicity), and I wrote ""white"" to keep my anonimity on the anon quals page. 6) @5 thanks for pointing out my misuse of the term ethnicity, I've changed it to race. Not sure what to do about understandable selective reporting. Maybe just ditch the column? AP -- 5 again) No worries @6! Some forms list race and ethnicity as a single thing, others seperate them out. I don't know what the solution is for reporting. Maybe people can report R/E in Misc. ID if they think it has been important. 7) I think ditching the column is a good move. 8) I'd be cool with ditching the column, I'm white passing and except for my last name, most people would not guess I am Hispanic, but I'd not feel very Anon on the AQ page. 9) I have to say I am with #4 here in that #2's suspicion is correct. I have not written in the AnonQuals precisely because I would be so easy to identify. How many Female Latino ichthyologist PostDocs do you know? (not my case, I just randomly made that up, but I'd be just as easy to identify). As to whether AP #6 should ditch the column, I don't know, because the data is really important, but I guess that what it's trying to assess is exactly why we non-whites are defensively reluctant to write our data there. 10) Even though I'm white, I've been concerned about being identified by anon quals, in particular by SC members who go on the wiki. They have my CV (# pubs), know my research area, etc, so presumably, if they wanted (though I know this is super, super paranoid), they could go on a see how many interviews/ offers I've had. Leaving mine up for now, but honestly have thought about deleting it or at least making it super vague. So I guess my main point is that if I were non-white I would for sure not be putting my info there. Also, yeah, I think it is obvious we are still overwhelmingly white. This is why those diversity statements are important. @10 lolllll nobody has the time to count up your pubs and check up who you are so I wouldn't worry too much about that x3 12) Our field is overwhelmingly white.  Far more so than even the college student population is, or than biology as a whole is -- the more molecular and medical fields are closer to the general population than our subfields are.  It's a problem.  But I'm pretty sure it's not quite as overwhelmingly so as the Anon Quals tab would indicate.  A lot of people really don't want to put up enough information that they risk being identified, for reasons they've specified above.  FWIW, the friend who gave me the link to this sheet was someone I thought I was able to identify on the Anon Qual tab, based on knowing their field, PhD year, race, sex, number of pubs (both 1st author and not), and number of major grants.  Turns out: not that person, but someone else who hits everything exactly the same.  I think some of us are less identifiable than we might think. 13) I'm not white. I'm waiting to hear back from all the places I applied to to put my info in the anno quals but will be vague with area of specialization. 14) It's not just the Anon Quals page, look at the faculty in just about any department website. So white. 15) @14...just as a point of fact the percentgae of white people in the US is like 61 or 62%, and when including white hispanic or latinos it actually is more like 78%. 16) @15 .. and the % of white faculty in EEB departments? 17) @16 I'm guessing it's approaching 90+% in many/most",NA,spousal hire - teaching position at R2

So perhaps in the awesome interview there were other people who seemed to be better fits and in the one that felt disastrous, you still were better than the others. ","Grants as not PI or CoPI Do you add in your CV grants when you are officically included as a PostDoc but didn't directly obtained the funds? 2) I think it's fair if you were a major author on a grant but couldn't be a PI due to institutional restrictions on who can have PI status to list the grant and indicate as such.  3) If you are clearly a main contributor for obtaining that grant (e.g. you contributed most of the preliminary data, many ideas, or even wrote an aim), and your PI can address that in the letter, then YES. If you are added because you will be the person who carry out the experiments, then NO. 4) I agree with #3, I am a post-doc on a grant which I was hired on to lead the grant activities but I do not list it on my cv under my funding/grants section. 5) Yes. add that information to your CV. 6) Agree with #2 and #3. I'm a post-doc paid with funds that I got through doing the bulk of the grant writing and I am performing ~85-90% of the work. Because of institutional restrictions I can't be PI, but I list that grant as a Co-I. Similarly, I'm paid as a 'consultant' of sorts on a large grant for which I'm doing a small portion of work. For academic positions, I typically list this under grants with myself as a ""collaborator"" and the $ amount the small portion of the grant that is actually going to me. To be fair, I did contribute to the development of some methods on that grant proposal - methods I'm now carrying out - which is why I feel ok putting it down under my external funding section. If they'd just found me through a google search and asked me to do a little work for them, I likely would have found somewhere else to put it. ",NA,"What if no tenure? So what happens in those (I hope rare) cases in which tenure is denied? Is it very difficult to land another job (I assume another Assistant Prof. position) somewhere else? Or do you have the option of remaining in the institution that denied tenure? Can you get a second chance at tenure in the same place? 2) I think people usually leave the institution that denied tenure. The two cases I know were able to find a TT job somewhere else, and even at better institutions. 3) You usually get 1 year to find a job 4) https://smallpondscience.com/2013/12/16/coming-out-of-the-closet-tenure-denial-edition/ 5) Some places let you reapply, sounds like it really depends on the place.  5) Always apply for at least a few other jobs when you submit your tenure package. It is easier to land a job then and you have counter offers for your tenure upgrade.  6) I have heard the same advice 5 gave - must be stressful, though to prepare a tenure package alongside job apps and the tenure docs would definitely be the priority.  I have never heard of a department/university allowing multiple tenure tries.  I have only heard of getting a 1-year terminal contract after a failed tenure bid.  Promotion outside of tenure is a different story. 7) If you know you will be denied tenure (off-cycle in the winter) and plan to go on the market in the fall (with a much stronger package), should you put your tenure package in anyway? 8) You never know what the outcome of a tenure review will be regardless of what you hear/expect.  Admin can reverse a department's decision (both ways) so it is worth putting the package in regardless.  9) I have heard of tenure packages being held up with ""clerical errors"" so that the faculty member gets another 6mo to 1yr to get news back on grants.  These are usually people who are meeting the other criteria for tenure and are close.  If you think you will be denied and are interviewing, I would put in the tenure docs. Don't fold before they call your hand. It willl look very suspicious to the people interviewing you if you admit you missed the mark.   Even if you are at a toxic institution that routinely denies tenure. 10) Having just put together my tenure package I can say it's a good exercise, regardelss of the tenure outcome. Based on this, my advice is to never let admin convince you to withdraw. let them do the work of building a case against you if that's their goal. You don't have to help them by quitting. And, by writing the package you help yourself to orgniaze your thoughts, recoginize your accomplishments, and set your goals moving forward. 11) I've seen people get denied tenure and land at an equivalent-or-better R1 a year later.  I've also seen them move from a research intensive to a more teaching oriented position.  I've also seen people get denied tenure and leave academia entirely.  I know one case where someone was denied tenure but offered a recurring NTT position, since their spouse got tenure and the university wanted said spouse badly enough.  Everyone I've ever heard of getting denied tenure (with the exception of that recurring NTT position) was offered a 1 year terminal contract; second chance at tenure at the same school just didn't happen.",NA,"Interview recording I've had 4 skype interviews this year but no on campus offers thus far. I am wondering if anyone has reached out to a SC to ask for the tape of their interview? I feel as though it might be instructive/enlightening to revisit the conversation after the fact, to identify areas for improved communication and/or presentation. My impression has been that the interviews went really well so I am at a loss for why none have turned into visit requests. I can see why SCs might find this request anxiety-provoking (from an HR perspective) so I'm wondering if anyone has advice or experience with successfully requesting the recording? 2) It might be easier to record it yourself. If they record you, you can record them (and you). 3) You aren't alone. Skype interviews suck for me, it's such an artifical environment. Trying to look at the camera, so they see you looking straight, but then you see them looking away and at papers, writing various notes down. I think they are as useful as the GRE (after being on both ends of a Skype interview). 4) Number 2's idea is great. You can easily record your own screen and mic. I also think that often committees might be interviewing 10-15 people by Skype, but they already have a good sense of their ranking. Unless you do really well and some of the highest ranked people do poorly, it is hard to move up enough to land a campus interview. 5) I put a glittery sticker by my camera so I force myself to look at it rather than at other corners of the screen"

REPLY 1) Hiring committees may have to demonstrate that there were no suitable Canadian candidates for a position when making their argument to the Blow Jobs to hire a particular (non-Canadian) short-listed candidate, but in my experience they will hire the best candidate regardless of nationality.

Re: is there a commonwealth advantage - to my knowledge, no.",NA,"Scheduling interviews someone deleted this lengthy discussion :(   2a)  I don't understand why - This topic was very relevant to people. But don't worry, that can be fixed.... ah, here we go:   I THINNK THIS IS REALLY WORTH DISCUSSION, BUT NOT ON MAIN PAGE. WARNING: This is the college that infamously and unapologetically withdrew an offer from a woman who attempted to negotiate. https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/03/13/lost-faculty-job-offer-raises-questions-about-negotiation-strategy 2) I guess my question is, would she have accepted the job if they countered with ""No"" for 2 through 5 and met her half way on the salary? To be honest, I would never expect a university (especially a primarily teaching institute) to meet me anywhere on 2 through 5, as maternity leave is probably a set standard for everyone, whether or not there are pre-tenure sabbaticals is probably goverend by the facutly handbook, you should have already discussed during the interview what classes you would be teaching, and not many teaching institutes (I am sure there are exceptions) are going to grant extended time so that you can extend your professional growth, which obviously they thought was adequate already. I could see the Dean and the search committee stepping back and thinking, ""Wow, she thinks this is University of Michigan. Lets go another direction."" Granted, they should have just told her no on all five if they thought the next candidate in line was adequate and that their number one candidate was being unreasonable. 3) Not the place to discuss this, plenty of other spots to do so. Move it to General Discussion if you want. 4) I see the college's point here, but it is surprising that they took the offer off the table. Particularly as a woman, I am concerned about what negotiations will be like (if I get an offer) and how I'll manage to ask for what I want without asking for too much. Women often don't negotiate, and that's why our salaries are still lower. I don't want to be like that. But I do not want to lose an offer or even just rub someone the wrong way before starting a position. I wouldn't ask for any kind of special leave beyond what is standard like W did, but would potentially negotiate salary, start-up funds, and relocation funds. How much is too much? How do we find out? 5) Negotiations are not something most us are trained to do. In addition, our mentors are usually from R1/research institutions and not aware of how to best negotiate at SLACs and even regionals. On top of this, the offer comes fast and there is little time for training. I am a male and am worried about this stuff too (Although I totally agree women have it tougher!). Of course, I should worry about actually getting an offer first. Finally, I wouldn't let this one incident stop you from applying...unless there is a known pattern at this institution. This is one messy situation and maybe not indicative of the college. 6) re: the maternity leave comment above, maternity leave is often not set by the university or standard. I'm currently an asst. prof at a state university and we have no (zero, none, NO!) maternity leave. certainly they have to give us unpaid leave in line with the family medical leave act, but beyond that there are not maternity or paternity guidelines. i have no kids and no plan to have kids immediately, so i didn't look into this before accepting my job, but it's obviously really appalling (in the past, women used to apparently frequently quit after getting pregnant). so, I think that it's possible that she was being very smart by negotiating for maternity leave. 7) So 6, maternity leave is standard: no maternity leave. 8) (not 6): So, 7, maternity leave is standard but terrible. Sounds like a perfect reason to negotiate. 9) (not 7), The faculty parking lot at a university I interviewed at was pretty bad. Should I ask to have administrative parking priviledges? I hope you see where I'm going with this. You are typically not going to get something during negotiation that far exceeds what someone else in the department has gotten or would not get if they asked. Example, ""Hi Beth, yes you can take a semester off of work for maternity leave. Sorry Beverly, I know you have been here five years, but you get no maternity leave, even though you just had a kid the exact same day that Beth had a kid."" This is the kind of stuff that faculty (collectively) negotiate with administration. Not stuff that a single faculty member negotiates with administration. 10) Maternity leave is too important not to fight for, and a job offer should never be rescinded because someone asks for it. 11) I have fertility issues and am currently having hormone therapy to try to get pregnant before I run out of time to have any possible chance. I'm also applying and interviewing for jobs. How to handle this is a little sticky, and I'm inclined to protect myself and my potential employers legally by not bringing this up even if I do get pregnant until I have a signed and finished offer. I wouldn't want the fact that I could give birth during my first semester to affect getting (or losing) the job offer. So I'm afraid to bring up maternity leave, even in negotiation. I think this incident shows that I'm not being paranoid about this. :/ 6, would you really recommend that women negotiate maternity leave? Unpaid leave is far better than no job. 12) Whatever you do, before you start trying to negotiate maternity leave with the department chair/head or college dean, be sure to ask human resources about the actual policy on maternity leave; e.g., I had no clue what my university policy was until two seconds ago. Looked it up on the Human Resources website and found out that mine is 12 paid weeks. Not bad. 13) I think that the maternity leave thing is a big deal, but I don't believe that it affected this outcome. My guess is that the total package (increased pay, delayed start, and limited preps) had more to do with it. That being said, it certainly is scary that it happened. Probably for the best for that candidate though. Several people have suggested that these negotiations are best done over phone. For my thinking, if I'm within 300 miles, I just drive and do it face to face; the ability to read body language being very important. 14) There needs to be more discussion and advice on how to negotiate. I went through the process last year and ultimately did not accept the job. My advice would be NEVER negotiate face to face and preferably not over the phone. It is way too easy to agree to something you will later regret. You also will likely not remember to ask for certain things. Finally, and this is a big one, you want whatever they offer in writing. I mean everything. Far too often something is verbally promised and later not followed through on. In a different thread I suggested we add a negotiations tab like there was in previous years. It is super helpful to know what other people are getting for similar jobs in the same geographic area. This knowledge is leverage - and you will need leverage. 15) Yes, there should be a negotiation thread. It is to everyone's benefit when candidates in the field negotiate well. 6) again. i seriously can't believe that someone is comparing negotiating for maternity leave to negotiating for a parking spot. i'm not even going to touch that one. someone asked for advice on negotiating for maternity leave. my advice would be to not negotiate for too many things-- pick a couple of things that are critical to you and negotiate for those things. for example, salary and office space were critical for me, so that's what i negotiated for. I did so in a very positive way (e.g. 'I'm very enthusiatsic about joining department XXX, and appreciate the offer. There are only two issues that I see, which I'm confident that we can resolve....). This worked well for me, as I was able to get an assistant prof salary that's above what some associates in the department make (still too low in my opinion, but that's another issue) and a great office. if maternity leave is your issue, i'd suggest going for it, but don't then also ask for 12 other things. before you negotiate for maternity leave you should also ask some women in the department about maternity leave after you receive your offer (and obviously check the HR website to see if there is a standard policy). if there's no set maternity leave policy, it's possible that the department has an unspoken policy (e.g. they always give a semester off). if this is the case, you don't want to waste your negotiating effort on maternity leave. also, a few other points on negotiating: I took a negotiating workshopwhile applying for jobs (i was at an ivy then, so this was a continuing education thing), and it was hugely helpful. i realize such workshops aren't readily available, but i'd suggest reading up on negotiating (it'll also help with house buying). always be positive and (most importantly) always have data to support what you're asking for. if it's maternity leave, provide examples of good maternity leave policies at peer institutions. if it's salary that you're interested, look up average salaries at peer institutions and use these to justify what you're asking for. when i negotiated, i even mentioned that my institution at the time had a larger pay gap between males and females than all nearby peer institutions. sure, they got slightly defensive about this, but then they moved quite a bit on salary. don't hesitate to negotiate hard, but just make sure that you do it well and that everything that you ask for is well justified. 16) I also seriously can't believe that someone is comparing negotiating for maternity leave to negotiating for a parking spot. Maternity leave is finite...a parking spot last forever. In the long run, a better parking spot is a much better deal. Think of how many minutes a day you would save with a better parking spot over a 30+ year career! But in all seriousness, the problem with capitalist America is that if you can't work and have a child at the same time, I'm willing to bet that there is someone who can. If your primary responsibility is a teacher, you are going to have trouble getting paid leave (someone is going to have to be paid to teach your classes). If your primary responsibility is a researcher (teaching only one to two classes a year), you are going to have a better chance, but in this scenario, I would rather have an extra year to get tenure than paid maternity leave (speaking from experience). 17) There's some excellent advice here. Thanks so much, everyone!","That by Hendry was a very stupid post. Not really surprising. 2) He got a job around 2001. It is much more difficult to get a TT job after 2008 than before. 3) Harsh 4) Lame post. 5) it is also interesting the reference in follow-up comments to friends and friends of friends. Truly what you expect from a scientist 6) So the 5000 of us applying for the 500 jobs available will get a job each if we are not picky. 7) oh that's only counting the ones that ""deserve it"". 8) ​I think Andrew is a bit of an anomaly.  He's a work horse and ​few of us can keep up with him.  But, I think his post has some truth to it and people are missing the big picture, especially with regards to settling on a job.  I know a lot of people on the job market right now who are only applying for specific locations or specific types of universities (e.g. R1).  Yes, maybe 5000 people are applying for 500 positions but hopefully those 500 people will be taken off the job market and you'll move up in the cue next year.  I think if you really want a job in academia and you're not making short lists at the places you're applying for, maybe consider applying more widely (R2, Phd programs, master's programs, undergrad state schools).  If you're applying more widely, sent in 100 applications, in your 6th year of your post doc, and still not getting a call back, maybe you should ask yourself (& perhaps your mentors) what about your application/experience is preventing you from getting a job... and fix it. 9) Except life isn't all about one axis. This idea that we just drop everything and drag our partners to wherever or ""we don't really want it"" is ridiculous. Also, many like me aren't trained to be educators. I'm a researcher. I see them as two different careers that require people with great talents, that don't always overlap. Mainly, I'm all set on advice from old successful white dudes that have no idea what life is like for many on the current market. 10) I dunno, advice from successful white dudes has served me pretty well. (x2 - coming from a young white woman; #10 - young ""non-white"" woman) 11) I think very few of us can ""have it all"" or be successful at both 'axes' as #9 put it.  If you want a family, great! but you might be outcompeted by someone who doesn't and therefore has more time to invest into getting a job (i.e. pubs, grants, etc). Unfortunately with the competition the way it is, it seems like most of us will have to make compromises and settle one way or the other (though I do know people who can 'have it all'; that's just not me). I think what Andrew is saying is that if you lower the bar, you're more likely to get a job.  Fewer people are probably applying to these jobs, which may put you higher in the ranks.  If you want to live in a specific location, it's likely that we all do too but we can't all get the one position that rarely comes up.  Therefore, we either lower the bar and settle in academia or find another career. 12) Hendry is clearly clueless about the reality of getting a job in the current market. As for #8s advice, yes, you can expand your search and this will help, but success is far from guaranteed. The advice for success my mentors provide is often hopelessly outdated, just like Hendry's comments are. If you are applying for R2s, don't be surprised when your research qualifications exceed that of many (most) of the associate professors and some of the full professors in the department. R2s are a different beast entirely from R1s in terms of landing the job. Hendry's advice is good for a small portion of the people on the market (the top 10%) but for the rest of us, take it with a huge grain of salt. 13) If you're too good for R2 and aren't getting an R1 after years of post-docs, then what do you do? 15) Wake up. In this market, in this career, no one is ""too good"" for an R2. That's a big part of the problem. And that is part of what Hendry is saying. R2s are hiring R1 caliber researchers, as are Comprehensives/LACs...but there you also have to demonstrate the ability to kill it in the classroom. No one ""owes"" you a faculty job, if you can't move across the country (or to another country) or if your spouse has another job. Sorry if someone told you that. x2 16) Wake up! It's ridiculous to ruin your life to take an academic job at some shit hole school or in some terrible place. My response is to try and work harder and smarter than others. I think it will work, but if not oh well. 17) I guess when #13 said ""one is too good for an R2, s/he meant that you wont even get shortlisted by them because they think you are too good for them and wont go to those schools. Puts one in a limbo position where one couldn't get a job at an R1 but wont get shortlisted by an R2. 13 again) I was being sarcastic.  I agree with 15. 17 again) LOL. 15 again) I'm watching two searches go on at an R2. Trust me, they don't EVER think that you are ""too good for them."" Not in this market. They think, here's a person who is desperate for a job and will accept teaching all the courses that we don't want to teach AND will bring in grants with overhead, while we have tenure and are no longer expected to bring in such grants. 18) Pass. 13 again) I have interviews at R2s and the teaching loads are comparable to R1s including early pre-tenure teaching breaks. As someone who never thought of applying for anything but R1s, I don't see anything wrong with R2s now that I'm knee deep in the process... but I think you do have to make sure you're choosing the right R2s (for you). 12 again) I've interviewed at both R1s and R2s and it is very obvious they are looking for different things. If you are not quite good enough for an R1 (my reality) then don't think this will put you ahead at R2s. So, while people suggest R2s just have a lower bar, it is more complicated because they evaluate you differently. I also don't think I'm too good for an R2, but I haven't managed to land a job at one (yet).19) #12 - what do you mean by R2s ""evaluate you differently [than R1s]"".  Just curious. 20) I'm not #12 but just did an interview at an R2...I found my teaching record was very important (teaching load at this place was fairly heavy) and that there was some clear resentment among some faculty who were less research-active towards those who have been very successful. I was also asked explicitly if I would bail on them for an R1. 21) Do you understand that Hendry wrote a stupid and offensive post, right? If 10-15% of postdocs find a tenure-track job, it means that the other 85-90% cannot find a job/go for another career (assuming that 50% - random %, but very high - do want to work outside of academia, 4 out of 10 postdocs would like to work in academia and cannot find a job). As far as I know, there are no empty seats that remain so for years, R1, R2, R25. If R1-value postdocs apply to (and win) jobs in teaching institution, people of TI-value are excluded. It's called numbers, it's called people living longer and retiring later in life. Hendry's post was really patethic. In fact, for Hendry, as a US citizen you have equal opportunities in Japan, Spain, Australia, US, forgetting that recruiting in those countries heavily favor people from those countries, when not from the same institution. You can go working in France, but mind you, you need to stay there all your life, because wrt American standards, you are paid peanuts. Then, add the ""if you want it hard enough"", ""if you are willing to move"", ""if if if"", and tell me what remains. Every person with decent abilities can have a career in the NFL. Really? Full professor of evolutionary biology, elementary school student of life. #12 again) In response to the question of how R2s evaluate differently -most of the R2s I've interviewed at have PhD programs and fairly low teaching loads (1 and 1) - even so, a considerable % of the faculty will ask about and want to discuss teaching matters with you so be prepared to discuss your approach to teaching etc to a greater degree. In many Bio departments most of the undergrads are pre-health - a commonly asked questions is how will you engage pre-health majors in the class and provide research opportunities for them (I'm phys ecol so might get this more than pure ecol). Also, even if the position is 1 and 1 load some of the faculty will likely have 3/3 loads and they are simply going to be more interested in what you can provide on the teaching front. 22) Where #21 sign a contract that getting a PhD or doing a postdoc meant that s/he was promised a job? Let's assume that 15% of postdocs find TT jobs. That doesn't really leave 85% without a job, because many postdocs aren't ripe enough for a TT job. For those more seasoned postdocs, it's probably closer to 50 or 60%. Hendry was saying that sooner or later most, not all, but most become ripe enough for some job. Why is that so hard to understand????? And if the delta between now (when you wish you were ripe) and later (when you are ripe) is too painful, how is it his fault? 23) Do you 22) understand that Hendry's ""maths"" does not make any sense, right? THe number of jobs is at first approximation fixed. A certain proportion of people who want a TT job and are qualified is not getting a TT job. Maybe you should go back to the chalkboard with Hendry. Remember that mathematics is important. Then, if you think you have all the world available to you (a US postdoc has the same chances in the US as in Spain), you should get out more. ",NA,NA,"Offer decision deadline On average, how much time will a school give you to accept/decline an offer? How successfully can this be extended? 2) We offer two weeks, and whether or not it is extended is case-by-case. Often if we think the candidate is negotiating in good faith it will be extended. 3) Any chance you can explain what ""negotiating in good faith"" means?  For example, what if the candidate has interviewed at other institutions and is waiting to hear back - is that good faith? 4) Easier to explain bad faith: hanging onto a job you know you don't want and won't take just so you get $10k more in salary at your first choice.  If you do this at 10 schools they are likely to get pissed at you.  Some might also include hanging onto a school you don't really want but hoping for a 2nd offer someplace else.  Not good for institution #1 but harder to fault someone in this market.   Most R1s will wait 2 months for a decision, but harder to draw it out beyond 3. 5) Pro tip: your offer actually does expire when it says it does. If you want an extension, get one, don't just assume you can keep negotiating past the deadline. 6) I was given 2 weeks, but asked for a short extention because we were still negotiating startup. I second what number 5 says. We were in active negotiation and I still needed a written extention ","Whats the longest people have waited after an on-campus interview?  I'm imaging the comments from family if I hear bad news the day before Thanksgiving. Ugh. 2) still waiting following an interview in 2009 (!).  In most cases decisions seem to be made 1-2 weeks after the last interview but obviously things sometimes take (much) longer. 3) I think it is safe to assume you won't be getting an offer 2-4 weeks after the last person interviewed. The HR hurdle can take awhile to get the offer out so don't fret. It might still becoming! 4) I got one offer about 4 weeks after the last candidate. I think (but I'm not sure) that someone else may have gotten an offer first and turned it down. In the end I turned it down too. 5) got my offier 4 or 5 weeks after.  I think they didn't reach consensus right away. I wasn't 2nd pick. 6） 3-4 weeks after the last canddiate interview.  7) I would echo the previous comments and say that about 2-3 weeks after the last candidate sounds about right. Another reason to always ask where you are in the order of on-campus interviews. 7) I think its decent etiquette to write chair, thanking them for the opportunity and such if you haven't heard in a month. I had an on-campus interview last year where I had to write them, I later had a amicable chat with the chair at a conference and she confessed she never planned on writing the rest of us, ""Everyone was very qualified, people were going to want a better reason than we actually had"". ","post-doc or alt-ac Well the TT search has left me going home from the dance alone again, but I'm currently weighing two options: (a) a post doc that would allow me to build on the work I've been doing the last couple of years, but take it in enough of a different direction that it could be interesting and exciting, or (b) an alt-ac position that would be more in support of science, doing science communication and outreach work. Option (a) keeps me on the track for the elusive asst. prof job -- though seemingly sending me more towards research institutions and less towards teaching institutions as my teaching experience gets older (teaching is what I'd ideally like to do). Meanwhile option (b) pays only a little more than what I'd make as a postdoc but is a stable, full time, year round, (presumbably) permanent position where already live; the work is perhaps less stimulating than original research, but it could be a good change of pace. Before you say this should go in the ""venting"" tab, I'm actually soliciting a little feedback ---- pros/cons I should be sure to consider (esp. long term pros/cons), etc. Game this out. 2) Don't understimate the value of friends you have in places you live. Additionally, stability can have a strong, positive effect on you that you can't always appreciate when you've never had it. I've gotten used to the idea that I won't get a TT spot, but I have stability and a decent life; many others have found the tradeoff valuable. 3) Leave academics now and don’t look back. 4) I say do what you think you will enjoy more. It may not be as stable and long term, but I suspect that you are a highly qualified individual that will be able to jump ship for stable work later on if need be, so I think the postdoc option is what you should take IF that it is what you will find more fulfilling. If not then go with b I suppose. Just my two cents. Good luck! 5) I suspect the answer to your question might be found in your personal situation. Do you have a partner, kids, ageing family nearby etc.? Are there plans? Could the stability or lackthereof affect others, or are you free to ""chase your dreams"" a little? 6) OP here - I have a partner of 5 years, but no children or other family restrictions. I could 'chase my dreams' a bit which I am tempted to do, though my partner would not join me as he is settled where we are so taking the postdoc would most likely mean dissolving that relationship as the odds are I'd just be going from that position to another elsewhere (small, rural town here so work options are already fairly limited)... Just found out that the alt-ac position pays less than I initially was led to believe as well so a little bigger roll of the dice in taking that position. Damn damn damn. Remind me why we all put ourselves through this? ",NA,"Contacting members in the dept A TT position was posted at an ideal R1 in my field (applied ecology). One of the dept members is in my smaller subfield, and I've met them very briefly but don't know really well. I was thinking about contacting that person and asking for some insight in what they might be looking for. I have no idea if they are on the search committee or not. Yay or nay? 2) Karen Kelsky at ""The Professor is in"" says you should not ask for permission to apply to a job that you are qualified for; she says this makes you look amateurish and like an apologetic and submissive grad-student/PostDoc. She is from the humanities, but I think her point may still be valid for the sciences. Let's see what others think. 3) I have never done this---but I was talking someone really famous in my field regarding the job search and he said that you should always try to e-mail someone in the department of jobs you're interested in and ask questions, show interest. He said he has seen this work well at the intial stage  4) Part of the search committee's job is to answer (reasonable) questions.  Yes, ask for guidance.  5) I think there's a definite difference between asking permission and asking for information.  For example, I saw one department advertising for a population geneticist.  I wrote to one of the faculty I know quite well there and basically said ""Can you tell me more about what is being looked for here?  I'm fully qualified to teach pop gen, and I'd be happy to also develop a higher level course in it than what's current only the books, but my research isn't directly in population genetics.  Do you have a sense if the department is primarily looking for someone to teach this subject, or primarily to do active research in it?"" 6) I've found thi super helpful- it helped me tailor my application because I got useful info on the trajectory of the department, teaching gaps, shared equipment- stuff I couldn't get online 7) I agree with Karen Kelsky, and having recently been on a search committee, I also can't tell you how annoying it is to have 50 e-mails from people asking us to effectively review their qualifications and tells us if we think they should apply or not. On another note, I did exactly this about six years ago when I was trying for a faculty position at an R1 -- I wrote to the Chair and she wrote back very promptly and encouraged me to apply. Fast forward six years and I happened to have lunch with her the other day. She asked if I'd applied for that position back in the day; I told her I had; she told me I hadn't had a chance anyway because they wanted somebody doing a totally different branch of my field. So if you write, but don't expect them to be honest! 8) What's the motivation for this kind of repsonse, do you think? 9) CYA - don't want to end up on the receiving end of ""So, yesterday I did something I don't think anybody ever did."" 10) LMAO. Totally. Also, my department chair has more room to negotiate higher salary and bennies with the Dean for the prospective new hire if the search pool includes a ton of all-stars, so there is some motivation there to encourage everyone to apply. I have never emailed anyone on a committee, because I assume they get hundreds of emails about searches and that bothering them might lower my favorability. 11) Asking permission to apply is silly, but getting some inside info on what they're looking for shows motivation and could be valuable in tweaking your app.",NA,"teaching demonstration I've never done one of these before and don't have extensive teaching experience; it's for a smaller liberal-arts institution. Any pointers or hints? Thanks in advance!  2) Don't give a 50 min ppt, make sure to engage students and anyone else in attendance.Plan for plenty of questions througout the lecture, plan one or two short activities, use the board. Do you have 1+ week to prepare? If so, add a pre-reading, preferably something short and straightfoward from primary sources. Think nature, science, or frontiers. Ask simple questions about the paper. They're looking for whats the classroom experience in your courses, not your actual knowledge on a subject so make sure whatever you do is focused on the students. 3) Find out as much as you can beforehand. Will you give the demo to faculty or students or a mix? Will it be paty of an ongoing class or a stand alone demo? Are you assigned a topic or can you pick anything? While I think 2's idea about assigning a pre-reading could work, I would worry about none of the attendees having read it, especially if it isn't part of a normal class. Having talked to a lot of people about these, I think they are almost almost always a bit awkward since it is such a weird format to come into without having developed any relationship or expectations with the students first. 100% agree that you should not just lecture and include some activities, but try to do a dry run of those activities with a group at your home campus before going and be prepared for what you will do if there is little/no engagement from the 'class'. 4) Be prepared in case faculty don't participate-- this is terrible, but happened on one of my interviews. They wanted to provide space for their students to participate, but the vast majority of people in the room were faculty, and I had told them to form small groups to discuss. Also find out about what the room will have-- bring your own white-board markers just in case theirs are all dead! I also agree with #2, except I wouldn't provide a reading. 5) As a faculty member/commitee member I am not really looking at material. If you are wildely incorrect about somthing, it is an issue. I am really looking to see are you familiar with teahcing methods, do you have an idea about how a class size will impact your methods, are you clear, will students respond etc. Although, I am not at a SLAC 6) I've done two of these, one at an R2 (full 50 min class for undergrad non-majors) and one at an R1 (20 minute ""class"" for upper-level undergrad majors) both with faculty and grad students as my ""students"". Even if you are assigned a topic by the search committee and told who to aim the lecture at, I would recommend starting with something at the beginning that says what type of class you are teaching and who you are teaching to because not all the people in the room may have been told. Also, focus the lecture to a single topic (you can even say in the intro, 'i've focused today's class on this topic, here's how i see it fitting in with the broader class). I brought a ""student"" version of some powerpoint slides (they were incomplete compared to the slides I was showing on the screen) so that people can follow along and stay engaged, and then did a jigsaw activity with figures from actual literature on the topic we were discussing. I also brought index cards and requested feedback, ""what did you learn from the class, what were you left wanting to know more about, and how could the class be improved?"". Though in both cases I felt like I was pulling teeth to get anyone to participate at all and in general the interactions were difficult and forced, feedback I got indicated that they all really liked the interactive nature of the class, the use of different approaches to teach to different learning styles, and that i used 'real data' in the classes. 27) yes"
NA,"UNC (Northern Colorado) For those who got a campus interview (congrats!), did they call or send an email? I heard I had made the final six, but haven't heard from them today, so looks like I didn't make the last cut. Oh well... (1) It was a phone call this evening.(2) There was a final six? How does anyone know that? (3) is this northern colorado or North Carolina? 
(3) #1 again... I was referring to Northern Colorado, did the OP mean the same? 4) Sorry, OP here, I was referring to Northern Colorado. I knew I had made the ""final six"" because they contacted my references and told one of them that from a start of 150 (or 200 or 300, she said she couldn't remember) they were down to six. For #1, would you be willing to share your area of interest?
(5) #1 again - genetics, behavior, ornithology.(6) Good luck whoever you guys are, the teaching load is a bit heavy, eh? 4) OP again. Yeah, I agree on teaching load, but these days any opportunity that includes research feels lucky. I did ask them about the future direction of the department and they indicated they envisioned an increasing role of research. That seems promising. Good luck with your interview! (7) What is the teaching requirement for this job? I applied for a job at a similar type of school and just wanted to compare, especially since a poster said it was heavy. 8) They want 3 classes per semester, or 2 plus a lab. On top of that, both the salary and start-up are VERY low, but they say they are shooting for ever increasing focus on research. Not sure how they expect anyone to have time to write grants to get money for the research the start-up won't pay for, but they expect. I guess schools can get away with a lot in this market...plus it's in a beautiful place, that always seems to count for a lot. Still, I'm not sure that would make up for it, you might not have any time to go outside.(9) Greeley is not beautiful. You might see the Rockies, but they are still a good 1.5 or so hrs away; you are in farm country..., but hey, it's a job!
(10) #1 back again... well, it's a decent-sized department with productive faculty, so obviously it's possible. From my experience, the teaching load, etc. are pretty standard for undergrad-based institutions that try to incorporate research as well. If you genuinely care about undergraduate teaching (and undergrad research) and aren't just paying lip service to it in your applications, then a department like this has a lot of advantages. (11) I am not at UNC, but in the area.  I one person there and >> who interact with the faculty.  The school does not have a good reputation at other Colorado Us and person I know is EXTREMELY unhappy (>>> teaching, unmotivated students, low expectations of the student body, etc.).  The teaching load is VERY high.  4-5 classes at 4 credits/semester (16 credits) is considered full-time teach appointment (so  ~3 semester for a 50% teaching appointment), at least in one science department I know of.  That said, I think the university is trying to push itself and change, the area is lovely (although Greeley is on the prairie and a meat packing town), and cost of living is low. Also CSU and CU have an attitude as the ""tier 1"" schools for the state, so I have a feeling the faculty there suffer from skewed perceptions as a result.

We know when you're fluffing and bullshtting the same way we know when students do this on essay questions. 3) @2, at my university they get a fraction of a bonus point for grants applied for but not received... seeking funding is better than not seeking it, even if no luck yet. 4) Well I've also been on several SC (and chaired one) over the years and I'm not sure I completely agree with you, #1. I see nothing wrong with including a couple of ""in preps"" and definitely don't see anything wrong with including papers that are under review. Why in the world wouldn't you see value in including papers under review? In addition, regarding #2's comment, many institutions give credit toward tenure for things like unfunded grant apps, so including those seems fine to me too. 5) Another benefit of listing 'in prep' papers is that this can show a new line of investigation the applicant has initiated, something that can be very important.  No SC is going to be fooled by in prep papers and having half a dozen such papers can look like desperate filler but one or two that highlight new techniques or a new line of research (especially if it differs from grad/postdoc work) is often very helpful. 6) I have to agree with 4 and 5. Maybe have a separate section that says like 'Manuscripts in progress' or some such? Seems like a happy compromise to highlight what you are currently working on while being clear that you know they don't count the same as already published stuff. 7) I've served on several SCs and we always took ""submitted"", ""in revision"" and ""in prep"" manuscripts into account. We also looked at grant applications (funded or not) to inform us on how they have pursued funding and what type of funding agencies they target. So, sorry you're grumpy, #1 and 2. But you certainly don't speak for all SCs. 8) Of COURSE you should be listing in prep/review papers in your CV. Just put them in a separate section. Oh, and when you list ""target journals"" like Nature and Science (or anything, really), you can be sure that the search committee will have a good chuckle at your expense. 9) I disagree with grants applied for but not received comment. As head of 2 SC, I've seen multiple people take note of people actively trying for external funding. This has only been further vindicated when a dean on a recent on-site specifically mentioned that he was glad to see the attempts at external funding on my application. 10) It's important to list funding, inclduing ones that are under review. Even list unsuccesful funding is not bad-- at least you tried. Some may think ""who don't write grant proposal"", but in fact that a lot haven't done so for all sort of reasons (well funded PI, visa restriction, etc). I also feel it's OK to write ""submitted"" although it's less convinicing for SC thus you get less credit. Please don't morally pressure everybody to submit to BioRxiv. People have many reasons not to submit to bioRxiv (personal choice, PI or collaborator preference, scared of getting scooped etc). A graduate student or postdoc can not control everything. 11) So annoyed at jerks like #1. How are applicant's supposed to avoid angering people with pet peeves like this when other people potentially on search committees (e.g. 3 & 4) like to see that information? Realize that applicant's get conflicting advice about these things but have to submit an application without perfect information. If you REALLY don't want to see 'in prep' papers, then just say that directly in your job add. Then at least you can be grumpy about people not following directions. 12) Seems like #1 is just mad that 'in preps' are being added to the same section as published papers. I see no problem in placing them in a separate section, provided a draft is available. (x2)  13) #1 here.  I have no problem with submitted etc in a separate section.  Same with non-peer reviewed work.  Just don't put either in the list of peer-reviewed.  14) I think that a separate section for papers in review or in revision is perfectly reasonable, but it seems like by the time we're seeking faculty jobs that we might have grown out of the whole ""in prep"" business. My newer work that is not published yet is usually represented in my recent conference talks, so why list ""in prep"" that could really mean anything?  I have a google doc of all of my papers in progress and there are a whole lot of them that won't see the light of publication for at least another year or two, perhaps longer for the coauthored ones with pokey first authors 15) @2 that's funny because I have reviewed Natural History Notes from Herpetological Review multiple times. x216) Perhaps what people mean by ""in prep"" varies? I list papers as ""in prep"" in a seperate section, however nothing goes into the ""in prep"" category until I could supply a complete draft it asked for one. X3","never contact SC There was a comment that seems to have been deleted on the faculty jobs tab under the open-rank ecology job at UT Austin about the gender breakdown of the interviewees. I thought it was interesting, not sure why it was deleted, but I think it's an interesting point: of 5 interviewees, only 1 is female. Given the long earlier discussion about an all-female 6-person interview list at Macalaster, how do folks feel about this? Within the range of normal odds, or more akin to a ""token female"" being included to ward off calls of gender imbalance? 2) I've been the sole woman interviewed in the past. The problem is that having one ""token"" means she sticks out, so it's not sufficient if you really want balance.  3)  I've been on a lot of search committees in the last decade and we have NEVER discussed the sex of a candidate when discussing applications.  We make a long list, we discuss it, we then rank the long list and the top 3-4 get interviewed.  We've never once stopped to say that we need more or less of any particular sex on the list of interviewees.  ...and I work at a University of Texas system school. 4) I hope you would have discussed it #3; the fact is there is a ton of implicit bias in academic hiring and if you're not discussing it, that's a problem, since there is a large body of research showing that women are consistently judged more harshly (e.g., need more pubs to get same consideration by search committees, etc.) 5) I agree, #2 - if a woman is a ""token"", it certainly isn't balance. And it also sucks because that person probably doesn't have the same chances of getting the job as the other candidates. I'm sorry for your experience and wonder how common it is - being brought in as the token representative seems like a terrible position to be in. 6) @1 I find refering to a female interviewee as the ""token female"" pretty insulting - as if that's the only way a women could make the short list? WTF century is this anyway. x3  6) #3 again.  No, we don't discuss it #4.  The applicants are sexless in my opinion.  We rank them based on qualifications and let me tell you something, I was chair of a search committee on one of our last hires and two of the three we interviewed were females and one of those females got the job.  We don't judge women more harshly than others.  If there are departments that look at an application from a female and judge her more harshly then a male counterpart, then there is a real problem there.  I've also had 11 grad students in the last 10 years and 7 of them were females.  I'm finding that females are starting to outnumber males in our grad program and at the meetings I attend annually and that's starting to be reflected in the number of applications we see from females for faculty positions.  ...and it's a very good thing. 7) OP here, HOLD UP. I'm not relegating anyone to token status - I have also been the only female on an interview list, and damn, it does not feel good to have put in hours and hours of time for a job I really wanted and very much wind up feeling like I had basically no chance of getting the job. I felt like I was on the list so that someone could check a box. Sounds like #2 has had this experience also. This has nothing to do with how good the female candidates are and everything to do with the criteria with which they are being judged. To call the candidates ""token females"" is to call out the reality that this happens, and to damn well hope that it starts happening less. That doesn't change the original question, which is very much in light of a previous and very long discussion about the sex of interviewees - should this gender ratio (5 interview slots, 1 female) be called out? Does this smack of inviting one woman to allay concerns that would come with an all-male panel? How often does this happen? These seem like real and highly legitimate questions. @3 and @6, I sincerely hope that your contention isn't that this somehow amazingly stopped happening last century. We women are strong enough to both be inherently awesome AND to call out insidious sexism.  8) FYI, assuming the field is equally represented by males and females, a binomial test of a 50:50 ratio with 4/5 successes (4 males & 1 female) gives p = 0.375.  For 6/6 successes (6 females & 0 males), p = 0.03.  Based only on the numbers, there's not much evidence of gender bias in the ""four male and one female"" case.  Of course hundreds of searches take place each year, so we expect that just by chance, a lot of the time, the short list will end up all male or all female (or nearly so) just by chance.  It's nearly impossible to say just from the numbers in any one specific case whether it represents a bias against one gender or ""tokenism"" or what have you. 9) Not that this negates any of the general discussion here, but as far as the specifics for the UT Austin open-rank search. I coung 7 interviewees on the seminar schedule--not 5--and 3 of those 7 are females. Plus, that search seems to have been run pretty much in parallel with the junior level ecology hire, which brought in 5 interviewees in the fall. Of those five, three were females. So in total they brought in 6 females for 12 interview spots. 6) Sorry for misreading the original comment OP.  I thought the original comment ""5 interviewees, 1 woman. I feel bad for the token female interviewee."" was implying that the female interviewee was a token female interviewee, which seems insulting to me. 10) SC member here, and I concur with #3. We have a current search with 4 excellent on-campus interviewees, of which 2 are female and 2 are male. Our goal was and is to find someone who, based on their record and the evidence available to us, would best fill our current and forthcoming needs, plain and simple. Sex/gender has never been discussed. I'm trying to be as objective and unbiased as possible, and I am asking you all if a hypothetical search that brings some females to campus who are *objectively* less productive or a poorer fit than some males who are not interviewed merely to balance the sexes of interviewees, is this really the best approach for my department and students? I'd also appreciate if some could share references to peer-reviewed science demonstrating this 'implicit bias' that occurs in all aspects of faculty hiring. It definitely concerns me when I see a woman say, 'I have also been the only female on an interview list, and damn, it does not feel good to have put in hours and hours of time for a job I really wanted and very much wind up feeling like I had basically no chance of getting the job.' Why did you feel this way OP? Simply because you were competing with males for the position and not another female? I hope readers of this comment will appreciate that I am being genuine, not trying to pick a fight, and sincerely would like to see feelings like those expressed by the OP go away for good.  11)  #3, again, thank you #10!  10) just did a quick search and found this promising sign fwiw: http://www.pnas.org/content/112/17/5360.full  13) Ugh, that Williams and Ceci ""cool, we don't need to fix anthing"" paper. In practice, those evals aren't going to look identical. http://www.nature.com/scitable/content/does-gender-matter-by-ben-a-barres-10602856 14) Those who have never experienced discrimination are going to struggle to understand the topic.  I greatly appreciate the efforts of 3 & 10 to not intentionally apply a bias against talented women (or race, or LGBTQ, or any other group). Also, I appreciate the question posed by 10. I would recommend that he performs a search on the material he is looking for because there is plenty out there, and I don't think it can easily be explained in the cell of a wiki. If you truly want to understand the scope of discrimination and ensure that you are not employing it, you need to educate yourself. The onus is on you, not those who are being discriminated against. We are busy trying to prove that we have the chops to compete in this field. Find someone you can speak to in person to explain what the experience feels like and the kind of mindset you acquire after experiencing it. Then, ask yourself if you still truly believe that you don't accidentally exercise any implicit bias. I hope that you find you do not. Personally, I did not fully understand discrimination until I experienced it. I wish it were as simple as ""not discussing gender,"" but it isn't.  x5 15) Just remember this, as awful as it seems to have to think about this stuff while trying to get a job, it's way worse once you get one and serve on search committees. Fortunately, once you get there, you will at least be getting paid for the terrible experience. x2  16) Williams & Ceci is trash, but it's a simple fact that more females than males are hired for ecology positions now (despite the applicant pool probably being slightly biased in the opposite direction).  For some reason, someone deleted this link I posted earlier: https://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2017/10/02/newly-hired-tenure-track-n-american-asst-professors-of-ecology-are-59-women/ 17) #2 here, not an ecologist. My current institute has zero female faculty. I met someone recently who was the only woman on the shortlist, and the only person they ""forgot"" to give all the relevant info material to. Ooops. In some cases the candidates probably reflect the pool, but in the aforementioned case, the department claimed to be trying to improve the representation of women. You don't do that by sitting there and waiting for it to happen. 18) OP back, after digesting some of this. Honestly, I'm shocked at the response. In my mind, there is little question that women get invited as sole/""token"" females in (some) cases where the interview list otherwise would have been all male. Of course this can happen by chance; more interesting would be to know if single-female interview lists are over-represented and how often women get those jobs. It's pretty insulting, regardless of intent, to have #10 ask if women just don't want to interview against men - that question betrays a complete lack of awareness, and also no small amount of disdain, for this issue and the women who dare to bring it up, even if this person thinks themself not biased. I do apologize that the use of the phrase ""token female"" came across as insulting - to me it so obviously refers to a problem on the end of the hiring committee, not with women, but it is always important to be careful with words. And thank you, #14, for putting thoughts to words better than I have. If gender is ""NEVER discussed,"" this problem will only persist.  This is not the solution - this allows bias to remain firmly in place, just going from explicit to implicit. x2 19) @10 Fit is inherently a *subjective* black box, in which is it very easy to disguise bias, implicit or otherwise. And productivity can easily be influenced by a biased environment. These measures are not as objective as one might wish. 20) to #2, I have never heard a biology or evolution department that have 0 female faculty (in 2017, not in 1970). It sucks to be there I imagine, but that's not what a normal department look like. Sounds like your department need to be called out. 21) <- Institute, not department. We have female eco faculty, but no one in genomics, which is far from gender parity in general.  10) OP those were your words to which I was referring. I'm confused as to why you would be insulted by that. OP) I'm reluctant to add more fuel to #10's fire, but: no, those were not my words. You asked if being the sole woman on an interview list was bad ""because you were competing with males for the position and not another female?"" I don't have room to explain sexism to you, especially not if you don't yet realize that it exists and is real, even (or especially) in the hallowed halls of academia.  Please seek out information from colleagues if you can't figure out why this is insulting. If you have students who bring up the spectre of sexism to you, I fervently hope you do not simply ask them if they don't like competing with boys. If that is all you can think to respond, even if you think it is an honest question, please send the students on to someone more equipped to deal with this. 10) OK, I didn't want to draw this out, but adding fuel to my fire? You can't be serious. Kindly let me know what, exactly, I said that was so incendiary..... ""I have also been the only female on an interview list, and damn, it does not feel good to have put in hours and hours of time for a job I really wanted and very much wind up feeling like I had basically no chance of getting the job."" _That_ is an incredibly sexist statement OP. I was just interpreting your own words in a logical way. How exactly did you intend your statement to be interpreted? If your writing is interpreted in a manner other than you intended, that is not the fault of your readers, nor does it mean they don't understand sexism. 22) OP is trolling, lay off of #10. x2  23) OP couldn't even be bothered to count the actual number of candidates before posting this thread (7 total; 3 female).  Disregard. 24) I believe OP is right about the breakdown for the open rank search. They are concurrently interviewing for a behavior position, and some of the interviews listed are for that position. 25) Recognizing sexism in academia is... sexist? Go read the HBR piece on what happens when there is one minority candidate in the interview pool. 26) Does not matter what those specific numbers are. Bias is real and not discussing it = hiding it. Just concluded my first search committee experience, and was dismayed at how much was NOT talked about, and how much weight was placed on how ""comfortable"" the senior members felt with the candidates. None of this was explicitly anything-""ist""; but it was plain to see how much more the outsider candidates had to work to make these guys comfortable. ""Fit"" is indeed very subjective 27) 4:1 M:F ratio is not cool, just as a 0:5 ratio is also not cool. I can't believe UT Austin didn't get a large enough pool of candidates to create a little more parity.",NA,"Transcripts/# of degrees Stemming from some apparent annoyance from some applicants, directed toward postings that request up-front unofficial transcripts: What is the typical academic path/# of degrees nowadays? It anecdotally seems that having the masters (or even more than one) is more common than it used to be - an applicant in the same post has 4 degrees (2x masters). Personally I'm at 2 (BA/PhD) x6. 2) I'm at 3: BS/MS/PhD x10  I was a bit weirded out by one search chair stating that they wanted official transcripts immediately upon the application, when the ad says that they would be required at an on-campus interview.  I sent them official ones from my PhD and MS; my undergrad school wants me to pay for every official transcript sent, so I'm honestly not inclined to send that when I haven't even gotten a phone interview. 3) I've always thought that getting a masters was less common now than in the past (not counting a masters on the way to a phd at the same institution, which would go on one transcript), though I don't think I've ever seen data on it. Anecdotally, I do know of several R1s that used to have masters programs and now only have PhDs. I have BS/PhD, but did two semesters abroad as an undergrad so for places that really want all transcripts I still need to send four... 4) Most of the people I know with both and MS and a PhD (me included) started out in a grad program at one school, left because of some issue (advisor leaving/being denied tenure, shift inresearch interest, funding problems, etc.), and went elsewhere.  Or else the advisor they really wanted to work with for a PhD wasn't taking students at that time, so they picked up an MS and applied again a few years later.5) I have transcripts from 7 different school; its a nightmare if they want official ones. One is from a long-time defunct business school; the grades for it are stored in my state's archive records. 6) (4 from the previous thread) 7 official would be a nightmare, and 4 official isn't a financial picnic when you have to pay for the official copies. Even in my own program I'm one of 5 that have more than a BS in the program, but the only one with multiple master's (three terminal elsewhere and 1 at this institution mid-stream), so I thought my situation was rare, and kind of appears to be. I won't lie though, the added experience and having an MEd has helped in some ways. 7) I actually appreciate it when they ask for transcripts... my training has been super interdisciplinary and eco/evo heavy, but my degree isn't in eco/evo. My transcripts show that I actually am qualified to teach eco/evo, and that's harder to convey in just my other materials alone. 8) Official transcripts (in addition to being a pain to wrangle) cost money, and that is why it is NOT COOL to ask for them up front. I am totally happy to attach unofficial transcripts/grade summaries. At least wait until on-campus interviews to ask for official transcripts? 9) I have no idea who/where these schools are that ask for officials up front, because i've never seen it once. Lets not pretend like it's a common problem/huge financial burden. 8 again) Try #528 and #523 for a start. Any cost is a burden - we are applying for jobs, why should there ever be a cost (other than time) associated with job applications? 9) Neither 523 nor 528 ask for official transcripts in the application 8 again) Well cool, I would have said 'transcripts required' without qualifying meant official transcripts, but if you don't think so... I will give you #528, they are not imposing a cost before hiring, which I am fine with. 9 again) Again, I've never seen an official transcript required prior to an offer of employment. There is no cost involved - unofficial is presumed unless otherwise specified  10) Had to send two official transcripts to two schools so far this year, no offer of employment. Cost $12 each, which is fine, just saying it happens. 11.) Before I went to university, no one explained to me that there was a penalty for withdrawing from courses after the first two weeks. So in my first term, I signed up for a ridiculous number of courses, and just kept the ones I seemed to be doing the best in halfway through. Despite having a great GPA, I ended up with 4 w's on my record. It was a really dumb thing to do, but I was just a poorly-advised (more like non-advised) kid at a big university. I never expected that this shit would follow me the rest of my career. Personally I don't mind sharing my graduate transcripts, but I much prefer my undergrad transcripts not be requested before the interview (when I could explain what happened) for this reason. I have to wonder if wanting to see earlier and earlier evidence of excellence is creating a scenario where people brought up in the best educated families with the best childhood support and resources are being preferred. 12) That's the point 13) @11 - I see what you are saying. However, I wouldn't worry about it at all in job apps. They just have to ask for them as a formality almost to determine that you really do have your degrees. At most they might possibly look at your cummulative GPA, but I doubt it. 14) Search committee member here. Official transcripts are requested solely for the purpose of confirming you have the degrees you say you do. That's it. Nobody on the search committee cares about your GPA or anything else on your transcripts. 15) Counter anecdote: I've had committees throughouly review both my classes and grades. One interviewer told me they use it as an additional way to cut the overwhelming number of applicants, which is what I always suspected. 16) I had one application form require that I input my GPA for each degree, in addition to asking me to send in my transcripts.  That led to a few minutes of me calculating the GPA for my MS, because I've literally never needed to know that number before.  It was bizarre.",NA,"When to reveal visa sponsorship is needed? I will need H-1B but have noticed some positions outside R1 (such as Rowan) are explicitly saying they won't sponsor. I have a skype interview at a public R2, should I ask about this, or wait until campus interview? 2) I'm in the same boat as you and I'm not saying anything until I get an offer but I'm only applying to those not saying anything about restriction regarding citizenship requirements. I did mention where I was from but didn't say anything about my visa status. 3) It's about the same cost as a moving allowance, so they shouldn't have a problem swinging it. Good luck! 4) I think those positions with such restrictions are rare, and I doubt you would want to be a place like that anyhow.  I wouldn't mention anything - they know where you are from.  SC members know how to Google.... 5) OP here, they don't know where I'm from, because I did undergrad and PhD in the US. But on F1 visas, so still in nonimmigrant status :(. Also there are a lot of challenges now with H-1B across the board, not just financial. 6) What are the new challenges? With the exception of the American Competitiveness Acts of 1999 and 2001, The annual limit has been the same since 1990. There is no way your university can help, except to sponsor you and help financially, so whatever new challenges you are claiming exist, aren't in the hands of the university. 7) you sound a bit rude @6.. it's not easy to be an immigrant in the US right now. But I agree that H-1B visa restrictions don't really apply to universities. There's a ton of restrictions in industry though.  8) Yes. @6 sounds rude and probably someone who doesnt need H-1B because if they do, they would have known that academic and nonprofit H-1B are not subjected to the annual limit. The new challenges are that there is a higher % of H1-B rejections in current administration due to various reasons. And even if you get an H-1B approval, when you go back to your home country and try to apply for a visa using the H-1B, depending on your country of origin, there would be a possiblity of rejection or background checks that takes months. And the H-1B process takes longer in the current administration than before. These are all the new challenges. 9) Profs have decent stats for O-1 visas, but you'll need to hire your own lawyer if the university won't help.  Not a visa expert, but that's how a lot of my friends did it.  Don't mention it until after you have an offer.  10) Some applications ask upfront whether the applicant would ever need a visa 11) the number of h1bs granted for academic positions hasn't been statistically significantly lower, but the average processing times at USCIS  actually have  https://egov.uscis.gov/processing-times/historic-pt   I don't know where this other information stated here is coming from  11) I had to sponsor a postdoc for an H1B (wasn't eligible for easier visas).  He eventually got it but it was deemed that his salary was not high enough for the position so I had to also pay him an extra $15K/yr.  So that might be another reason universities don't want to go this route. 12) Even the government can't believe how little we are paid! 13) The same thing as #11 happened to someone in my lab. My PI had not budgeted extra (I think also about $15k) for it and had to rescind the postdoc offer to that person. Luckily they got another postdoc in their country after only a month, but that is still quite upsetting. 14) @11 (the first one) those stats are accurate (I-129 premium) but the processing time is just until they give you a first decision. They can reject you or ask for more documentation and drag it out. That is what's happening more and more now. 15) I'm a postdoc and even though my advisor was fully supportive of me and willing to pay the fee for visa sponsorship, the university didn't want to process the paperwork for an H1-B visa, they said they only do this for tenure-track scientists :( "
NA,"Wisconsin La Crosse Short list was made on 2/1 with phone interviews 2/2-2/24...my question is this: how did you find out a short list had been made on 2/1?  I'm assuming I wasn't on it since I didn't get a phone interview request, but still just curious how this was found. 1) We know it because many of us received a rejection e-mail on that day.

2) I probably should have put my question in a better context. ""Short list"" and ""long list"" are a bit enigmatic since loosely defined. I got letters requested, but I didn't consider this ""short list."" But if rejection letters went out on 2/1, then I guess that is a short list. I suppose my question revolves more around those of us in limbo. I apparently made the short list, but have not been contacted for a phone interview. I'm wondering now if there's an ""even shorter short list"" out there. Has anyone actually been contacted for phone interviews yet, or is the 2/2-2/24 dates just speculation? 

3) I have not received a rejection or interview, so guess I'm in limbo!",NA,NA,NA,"Anyone apply to the wetland ecologist position at Drexel? I never saw it posted here, but I applied two months ago. Pretty much assuming they're not interested at this point. Has anyone heard anything? In the ad I saw, the deadline was the end of March, so I suspect they are just now going through applications. OP here, in the ad I have, the deadline was Feb 28. Guess they pushed it back.",NA,"search put on hold 1) What clues should you look for to determine if there is an inside candidate?  2) Is there a visiting assistant prof on the website that has identical areas of interest as described in the job advertisement?  Let me tell you something, though.  I would not think about this and just apply anyway.  I'll tell you why.  A few years ago Davidson College in NC was looking for a conservation biologist and there was a visiting assistant prof there that had all kinds of past connections with the faculty in the department and whose expertise matched the job advertisement perfectly.  So, I didn't apply.  I didn't think it was worth my time.  Well, low and behold, he didn't get hired.  They hired an external candidate, so just bite the bullet and apply.  I had a similar experience with a gig in VA, where there was a visiting assistant prof that matched the job description, and she didn't get it either and they even told me up front that she applied.  3) The Beloit College job seems to fit this profile, no? It looks like the last 1-2 hires were visiting profs prior to becoming tenure track. It's a pretty shady approach if you ask me. 4) Being angry about internal hires is a waste of energy folks. This happens in EVERY type of instituion (private, governent and academia) and EVERY type of field. Knowing someone within the organization gives people a leg-up. Our field is no different (with maybe the exception of spousal hires).  5) correction, knowing someone on the inside with whom you have a good relationship is a leg up, unless that person is not respected in the department. 6) Depends so much on dept (and not necessarily institution). Some value the evidence that VA can do the job; other department always want shiny, new toys... 7) I just figured out that there's a VAP who is surely competing at a place where I've got a campus interview next month. They are a SLAC, and they are flying me in from Europe (where my postdoc is). They wouldn't fly someone all that way if they weren't serious competiton for the VAP, would they? Also, does anyone have experience meeting the VAP who is obviously your competition while interviewing on campus? It's a small department, and they are planning on having me meet pretty much everyone and also having an evening social for the depratment. I hope it's not awkward. And I hope I have a real chance. 8) I've been aound two searches where an internal candidate was competing for a job against outside candidates. In both cases, the internal candidate was not on campus during the interviews, and I would be surprised if they had you meet with the VAP during your on-campus visit. For the record, there's always a shot, even if there is an internal candidate. However, I think the odds decrease if you're an external candidate going up against an internal candidate. Sometimes a SC won't know who they want until they get to meet everyone, sometimes the internal candidate gets a job elsewhere ... you can drive yourself crazy thinking about it. You've got an interview, and that's always great practice (assuming you haven't already been on half a dozen). I think it's helpful to list when there's a potential internal candidate in job postings simply because I do think it makes it less likely that you'll get a position, so it's a piece of information to consider when deciding where to allocate your limited resources.If you've already got the campus interview lined up, enjoy it, and try not to think too much about all the factors beyond your control. 9) I know definitively 5 job searches (two R1s and three M/Ls) where internal candidates were overlooked for outside candidates. I don't know why anyone would think that the internal candidate has a leg up, or would spend less time getting materials ready for a job application b/c of the potential of an internal candidate. For every one faculty member that thinks the internal candidate is great and that the status quo should be maintained, there's another faculty member that thinks the grass is always greener. For every faculty member who is best friends with the internal candidate, there's a faculty member that the internal candidate burned a bridge between. I've never seen people so concerned about an internal candidate. If you are better, you are better. If you are not, you are not. It's almost like people are using this internal candidate shit as a crutch. To be honest, with the rapid saturation of the VAP position at universities, it's hard to believe that everyone who gets a job won't have to beat out at least one internal candidate (we had two for our last job search, oddly enough...neither were hired). And what about the big schools that might have three internal candidates. Not all three are going to get hired! You like the sound of a job and you think you would be a good fit? Apply. But don't do it half-assed b/c my friend's friend told me Timmy was a VAP and has the inside track. 10) I know definitively of 5 job searches where the internal candidate was hired. Who ever said anywhere on this board that we should half-ass an application because of an internal candidate? There are lots of topics that are discussed on here that aren't going to change the applications that we submit. 11) (7 again) Thanks for the advice everyone! I was mainly interested in people's experience interviewing when there's a VAP (did they meet them?). Sounds like usually no. But if I do meet this person, it will be fine. Just wanted to know about others' experiences. I will certainly be giving it my all, VAP or no VAP, and I'm super excited about this position and think it would be an excellent fit for me in so many ways. I echo what the others have said - whether there's a VAP or not, apply!!! In the end, you will be able to offer slightly different things from the VAP, and in the end, the committee just has to decide which things are most important to the department. Thanks again, everyone! I'm still curious to hear from others if they met the VAP during their interview (maybe not a set meeting, but at a social event or your job talk or something). 12) There was one situtaion that I was sure that the VAP was interviewing. I did end up meeting with the VAP but s/he hadn't made the shortlist. I think it would be very unusual to meet the VAP if s/he is also interviewing. 13) #10, someone said, ""I think it's helpful to list when there's a potential internal candidate in job postings simply because I do think it makes it less likely that you'll get a position, so it's a piece of information to consider when deciding where to allocate your limited resources."" To me, it sounds like #10 is saying that if they applied for a job where they thought there was an internal candidate that they would not allocate as much time (half-ass). I guess you could also interpret this as not applying at all (another poor decision). My comment was to demonstrate that there is no reason not to apply and give 100% effort if you think there is an inside candidate. I almost feel that some internal candidates are probably on here and are telling people not to apply for jobs when there is an internal candidate to try to limit the application pool.  14) #13, no need to be so rude in your comments. Particularly at colleges, there are many reasons a VAP could have a leg up; this advantage probably diminishes substantially at more research-oriented institutions. No one ever suggested shirking an application, either. I consider it wiser to give full effort at the places you're most focused on, and to do that, you can't apply everywhere. I've applied places with a VAP in place. I also use my own judgement about time in applications vs. time in job-building efforts, and sometimes that means accounting for jobs written for an internal candidate (which does happen). You're welcome to pursue your own strategy, but if you want to start taking bets with even odds for a VAP at a teaching college, I'm happy to supplement my income. 15) Dude, I want in on the bets. I'm an Asst Prof at a primarily teaching university. The last two job ads we had were hired externally. Both had inside candidates. I don't know how all liberal arts colleges work, but at my small state school, we don't look at any applications differently (internal vs. external). One of my buddies at a SLAC told me that they hire VAPs like we do Asst Profs. VAP hires are basically pre-tenure track with potential to ""promotion"" to tenure track. If they want to ""promote"" the candidate to tenure track, they put a small ad on the biology home page advertising the position, run a small search, and then conclude the VAP is the best candidate. However, honestly, I think this type of scenario is more of the exception and not the rule. I think at most universities you are even money with a VAP before the SCs look at your application. 16) I guess if we'd been betting on the schools we've been associated with, we'd both be rolling in the dough. 7/11 again) Well folks, I gave that interview everything I had, got tons of positive feedback, and they offered the position to the VAP in the end. Before someone gets overexcited, I'm not saying this happens all the time, but it happened in this case. More data, right? I'm really curious about rates of VAP hiring when there's a VAP contending at SLACs (and at other types of schools).","I finally get a campus interview at an awesome university in the UK. I am a great fit for the position and super excited to go, but... THEY WON'T PAY FOR MY FLIGHT! Am I seriously supposed to shell out $1500+ just to go to the interview with an uncertain outcome? I don't have that kind of disposable income just lying around. So frustrating. I guess I will try to see if they will do the interview by Skype, but that just isn't the same.  2) They actually said they won't pay for your flight?!  Doesn't sound too awesome.  I had an interview in the UK and the first email just said ""your interview will be in Room X, Building Y, on date Z at 9am.""  WTF.  They did in fact pay for my ticket, although I suspect they had their winner picked a priori and the rest of us were just cannon-fodder. 3) OP here. The intial email just had the Room X, Buidling Y... along with a expense reimmbursement form that stated they only pay for expenses from the port of entry into the UK. I followed up with both HR and the search chair and was told that they would only cover my expenses while in the UK, so I am on my own for the flight. That is such crap! Seems to me like they aren't taking my application very seriously or they would cover it. I am waiting to here back on if we can just do it over Skype, but this is pretty frustrating when it is the only interview I have been invited for (so far, hopefully) and I can't afford to go.  4) It sucks, but how much more $ does a faculty job pay than a postdoc?  Let's say $25K per year.  If this means you get a job 2 years before you otherwise would, you gain $50K.  If your chance of getting it is even 10%, that's an expected value of $5K.  I'd buy the ticket.  Tack on a little vacation while you're at it. 5) that math only works if you have the savings to lose the 1500 to begin with. And if you go to multiple interviews that are far away, the bank account gets small very quickly, even if they are eventually reimbursed. 6) I had to buy my ticket upfront then get reimbursed at the interview... it's currently sitting on a credit card but at least they will reimburse me for the ticket (not the interest I'm acruing though :/).  If it's a job you REALLY want then I'd consider 'eating' the cost of the ticket and like 4 said, take a little vacation! 6) OP here. Thanks for all the advice. The math presented by 4 does get a bit tricky as there are too many unknowns regarding how long it might be on the market if this position doesn't go through, actual salary at the UK uni, etc., but I see the point. I think I am just going to bite the bullet and pay for it on this one. It sucks, but if nothing else it will give me some experience with interviews and get me out of my crappy basement office that I share with 5 grad students for a week. #PostDocLife 7) Hundreds of anonymous animals will be rooting for ya OP. (x5) 8) Congrats on the interview - be aware that European interviews tend to be quite different from North American interviews - don't be surprised if you meet your competitors at the interview - individual meetings with faculty are less common - they will often have panel type interviews. Good luck 8) Oh yeah, I just met with the committee for an hour: 15 minute research talk, 15 minutes questions about talk, 15 minutes more general questions, 5 minutes questions for them, and 10 minutes for them to write their notes / discuss without me.  That's it. 9) OP here, I have done quite a bit of research on how UK interviews go and they do seem to be quite different. I have  been asked to give a 10 minute talk related to a theme suitable for second year undergraduate students, in which you indicate what teaching methods you would use to maximise student engagement and achievement, with 5 minutes for questions, and a 35 minute interview. This will definitely be different that what I am used to, but it should be an interesting experience if nothing else. Any other tips for UK interviews? 10) Expect the Dept head to have a lot more sway than in the US.  They have a lot of input on who is hired at many schools, whereas in the US the dept head mostly is an admin. 11) Best of luck, OP. This UK university should be ashamed of themselves for not paying for the trips. x3 12) Call me petty, but I think a university that behaves that way ought to be named. Then again, perhaps they're desperately poor.  13) I doubt they are poorer than the average pdoc. 14) OP here, it is a smaller school in the UK, but I have to imagine they probably could pay if they wanted to. But with the number of candidates on the job market (see row 68), maybe they know they can get away with not paying for the interviews. And as #8 mentioned, European interviews are much different and lightning quick. I have a 10 minute presentation and a 35 minute panel interview. Thats it. So that might make them less inclined to pay for the trip when it is just for 45 minutes of face-to-face time. Not saying it is right, just saying that it is different. I will probably keep the name of the school private for now, but if I don't get the job I may change my stance on that. Thanks for all the support!",NA,NA,"Interview for a cluster hire How much emphasis should be put on collaboration with the other positions that are advertised during a cluster hire? Many more universities are going this route but often the cluster hires don't overlap a lot (e.g. hiring a fungal biologist and atmospheric chemist). Is there a need to show that you have considered collaboration with these other hires or is it better to focus on your program and highlight how independent and self-sufficient your program is? 2) assuming you're not interviewing for a senior position (e.g. leader of a new center), just emphasize why your stuff rocks (in the committee interview do give lip service to the other positions).  The cluster hires at my R1 have the nickname of clusterf*** and half the time, some of the other positions aren't filled as advertised anyway. 3) Can I 'like' comment #2? We do not do 'clusterhires' in my department, but several years ago I interviewed for a position that was part of a cluster & it was a joke.","Not getting interviews at many places that seemed hopeful a few weeks ago... Keep my head down, send off five more apps in the next ~12 hours. It's brutal! Competition is steep, you guys are awesome.","Job talk: SLAC vs. R2 School I have two jobs talks coming up, one at a SLAC that is mostly teaching and 'maybe' some undergrad research, and another that is at an R2 school (little teaching but definitely with undergrad, grad, and postdoc research). Should my SLAC job talk be very different from the R2 school talk?  If so, any advice on how to structure each, especially the SLAC one? 2) easy. everytime you use the word 'undergrad' in slac talk, replace with 'MS student' in R2 talk. 3) I would play up the ""sustainability"" of your research program with undergrads with busy schedules as one big area. Any perks that your system has that makes is great for undergrads to work on and things along those lines. 4) Personally, I would make these 2 talks pretty different.  For a SLAC with ""maybe some undergrad research,"" I'd assume the main goal of your job talk is to show how well you can teach undergrads.  Essentially your research seminar is a teaching demo.  Include a long intro and really spoon feed each slide.  Agree with #3 that mentioning how you can incorporate undergrads into your research should be done frequently and in detailed, concrete ways.  Also show photographs of undergrads you've already worked with (if applicable) on slides with data they collected for you.  FWIW, I employed this strategy at a SLAC interview and got a lot of good feedback from both faculty and students (and later an offer).  For an R2, I'd give a standard research seminar.  Curious to hear other people's thoughts on this. 5) These are a lot of good suggestions IMO, but keep in mind, too, that SLACs vary widely in how much they emphasize research--at some of the elite SLACs teaching loads are comparable with R2s and your research program should be pretty active. So think about where the institution you're interviewing at falls on that spectrum.",NA,"No phone interview? Should I be weirded out that a school made an on campus offer but I never had a phone interview? 2) It's not super uncommon to go straight to campus interviews. Be grateful! 3) OP-Thank you--this just hasn't ever happened before to me...nor have I seen it talked about much here. 4) It happens. In the UK, for example, it's the norm. I was also recently invited for an on-campus interview in Canada without any previous interaction with the search committee. x2 3) It's happened 3/3 with my interveiws so far at US schools! 4) I think it is more common in the US at R1s that might be brining in 5 candidates to interview anyway and have a hard time scheduling phone interviews around everyones schedule. 5) OP again--that makes more sense that I haven't experienced this--I'm not applying to R1s. Thanks all!  6) 3/4 of my interviews went straight to on-campus 7) Not the norm for me, but I had it happen last year for a VAP - I chalked it up to a time crunch at the time. 8) I was reading on another post that many people who have been involved in multiple searches absolutely despise Skype calls; they say that they only ever change rankings when sombeody completely bombs it or shows a lot of great stuff that somehow they forgot to put into their application package. I have no experience, but these people said that the ranking of candidates rarely ever changes after Skype interviews. 9) What 8 said. And also, I have had 2 R1/R2 schools do 10-15 minute Skype or phone interviews. What the heck is the purpose of that? For me they have been super awkward and felt very rushed. On longer phone interviews and campus interviews, I've essentially presented a completely different person (myself). So I think these places really should just go straight to on-campus if they are too pressed for time for proper 30-45 minute phone interviews. 10) @9 Maybe they just wanted to quickly make sure you're not an absolute weirdo? This is science after all...   11) I did have friends (more than one!!) say during the phone interview they weren't sure if they were really interested in that school.  That's a really good way to NOT get the in person interview.   Don't do that.  ",NA,"Applications due a month ago--should I contact? Applications for a couple of the colleges I applied to were due a month (or more) ago. Apparently nobody has heard anything from the search yet, including requests for letters and Skype interviews. Any thoughts about what might be going on, and if I should contact the chair of the search committee? I'm guessing this is a situation for ""don't call us, we'll call you,"" but it's tough when other searches seem to be moving forward much more quickly! 2) 1 month is not that long. A lot of search have to approve short/long lists at faculty meetings and/or with deans, which can take weeks. If it goes 2+ months, then I'd perhaps consider sending an email to the chair.  x2  3) Don't pester the search chair.   They almost certainly have to have a few weeks for everyone to read apps and then schedule the meeting.  At 6 months I'd say it's been too long but emailing the search chair won't help you.  4) I am also not sure what would emailing the chair accomplish besides making your feel better/worse and them annoyed. If you are out and they just didn't notify you (or anybody else on this wiki) then you are out and emaling won't change that. And if, as others have said, they are just taking their time, pestering them about it will not be a good look. 5) Musn't disturb the precious time of the committee! The delicate geniuses at work! Oh an email? How dare you?!? What a ridiculous world academia is. 6) @ 5 - sure, but times that number by 100 - 200.. or whatever the number that applied. 7) you know they could prevent that if they treated candidates graciously and let them know they're out... just sayin 7) I think the issue is less what the chair thinks and more that you will not learn much. Only email if you have another offer but want the lagging job 8) @7, that's against HR's rules... HR is rather self-centered"
NA,"Our Organisms Thanks! to whoever set up the ""Our Organisms"" sheet!! ...something refreshing to see while I cruise this wiki.  1) I didn't know there was more than one person on the job market that studies the same species. It's a tiny community of us and I can't figure out who it is. Good Luck!

2) Yes, this is interesting.  I know of only 3 other people who also study my organism (even to the family level), and none of those 3 are on the job market right now.  Hmmmm, very interesting.  I'm curious to know if there's a new person in our niche!  I hope so, it's a cool niche in my very bias opinion.         (3) I know!  There are some awfully interesting organisms up there.  After we all have jobs, there should be some kind of ""reveal"" so we can make nice with all our colleagues. 4) I agree! The page was a great idea! Who studies the wacky pickle?

I am starting a 6th year as a postdoc. I have a handful of good papers and was lucky enough to get 3 on-campus interviews this year (better than last year) but nothing worked out. However, I grow less optomistic of getting a position. I have a very supportive partner who will not move to about 50% of the US (this seems reasonable to me). I love teaching (primary) and research (strong second) but am simply wanting a job in a decent location. I have been so focused on this TT goal that I don't even know where to start looking. I am putting this in the Discussion as I am not complaining or bitter-just wanting to move forward in some direction. The job market is worse than it has been in at least the last several decades. TT positions at tier-1 universities are going to people at other tier-1 universities who are making lateral moves. You can't even get your foot in the door without a major NSF/NIH research grant and nature/science papers and an H-index of 15. Masters-level places are getting the spillover:"" people who would have been shoe-ins at tier-1 places in years past are ending up at regional colleges with higher teaching loads and fewer resources. Three interviews means you're on the right track. But being less flexible geographically is making things more challenging for you. It is not uncommon for people to spend 7 years in a post-doc(s) these days, or more. If you can wait and wait, you may be able to pull something off in your geographic location of choice. But it could take quite a long time. Try to stretch the geographic areas allowed in the search as much as possible.                                               *** Another opinion **** getting directly at your question, I threw in the towel after 8 years of a postdoc/soft money... I had my own NSF funding, 6 interviews at R1 institutions, and another 2 at primarily teaching places. Everyone kept telling me that it would only be a matter of time. Frankly, I was done caring after about 6.5 years and spent a lot of time considering other options. The hard part, really, was figuring out what those other options might look like. I looked at industry jobs (not that there is any real industry for ecology, but any industry looking for warm bodies), and anything else that might be out there. The more I looked, the more I realized how many cool ways there are to make a living out there... many (most?) of which are less stressful than academia. I ended up with a job at an NGO, make more than many associate profs, live in a great location, and get treated like a grown up instead of a supplicant. There are a lot of things I miss about academic research, but there are a lot of other great things to do out there. If you feel like giving up, it's not a bad idea to at least think about what really matters to you (is it the smart colleagues, interactions with students, thrill of discovery?) and try to imagine what other careers might look like. You really might find something better.  (3) I almost left in 2011 to shift to farming.  I had the property selected, the business plan done, and everything.  Then, I was offered a position for a ntt job (supposedly permanent).  I took it, moved, and now 18 mo later I am right back where I started.  So, maybe I'll pull out that business plan again.  I'm tired of being turned down by some of the ugliest girls/guys at the party.  I have a better grant record and better pub record than most who interview me, and usually, its better than who gets hired.  Its getting old. (4) I'm in a similar boat to OP & 2. I may take another postdoc position soon (postdoc #4), but mostly because it involves cool research I'm good at, and it would give me a foot in the door at state/fed gov agencies as well as a better way to market myself to nonprofits or environmental consultants. I'm really close to dropping out and doing somthing else, but a large part of me really loves doing field work, and a solely office based job will make me crazy and fat in the long run. I highly sympathize with the OP about location. There have been lots of good job posts in small rural communities where my wife and I would be miserable. If I'm going to move us to somewhere, I want it to be a place we'll enjoy, make friends, and stay for several years.....not arrive and immediately try to get out and go somewhere better.  (3) to #4, most of your time in academia is spent sitting on your can grading, in meetings, or prepping lectures, or grant proposals, or pub submissions.  You still get fat! :) <--at least I have i my time in academia. (5) I am in my 8th year too. This cycle I got only one phone interview, and my current position is not that good because of the boss, even though I have my own funding. I am very tired about this whole situation. However, even though I don´t think I have any chances at all, I will try next job cycle one last time. If I knew what else to do, I would leave this limbo right now. (6) OP here...thanks for everyone for posting. I think that (2) offers great advice as far as figuring out what really matters (smart colleagues, field work etc) and imagining what other careers would work. Hopefully our ""community"" can better integrate academic and non-academic professionals...we need more non-academic mentors if fewer than 15% of us get tenure-track positions. As for everyone else, it is ""good"" to hear I am not the only one. All my mentors note that something will surely happen this next round. As these mentors successfully got academic jobs there is a serious bias here (they all mean well and are great people). I am planning on keeping in the applicant pool this next round but will also start to explore other options. I would rather be looking while employed. I think if nothing works, my family and I will move to where we would like to live and try to build something there. I have enough skills (coding, writing, teaching, stats, project management, etc) that someone should be able to keep me busy for 40 or so hours a week. I think being a prof would be great but there are a lot of other rewarding paths...it is a challenge to not be myopic while sitting in the ivory tower. Onward and upward! ",NA,"Sewanee 1) Such a pretty location, but the pay blows with all three ranks making well below the median for a 4-year school.  Looks like assistant profs start in the low 50's.  Ho hum.  :\ 2) Not uncommon salary for a lot of 4-years. Any idea on what is meant by ""extended contract system""? Is it basically permenant but without tenure? Or is it more similar to a visiting assistant professor position? 3) Not uncommon salary, but fairly low cost of living. My guess is the system resembles that of some European universities - renewable 5 year contracts or something like that. 4) 1 here, again, I'm going to have to disagree with you on the cost of living in the Asheville area and I'm going to disagree with this not being an uncommon salary for this size school.  I use the Chronicle of Higher Education salary survey, which compares the salaries at individual schools with all other schools of the same size and it indicates that the salaries of assistant profs at Warren Wilson are below the median for this size school with an average of $54,200/year.  Associate profs and full profs are even worse off with averages far below the median for a 4-year school.  Full profs are only averaging about $65,000.  That's not ""not uncommon salary"" for this size school, that's downright shitty.  Just look at UNCA in the same vicinity as Warren Wilson.  It's also a 4-year school.  Full profs are averaging around $85K and assistant profs are averaging around $64K.  Much more realistic numbers given the cost-of-living in the Asheville area.  I will say this, though, if you look at the biology faculty at Warren Wilson, many have been there for quite some time and there's a good spread of individuals in each rank, which indicates to me that folks like being there, which is a good thing.  5)  1 here again.  Asked search chair about extended contract system and this is what she said ""This system is our equivalent of a tenure system. In practice, it involves a review of the contract after 3 years, with subsequent review and renewal every 7 years. I have taught at institutions with tenure-track positions, as well as this system at WWC. In practice, I have found both to provide the appropriate level of checks and balances, combined with job security.""  Also, talked to several faculty there and they all agree that the pay sucks, but said that folks are happy enough there that they make it work.6) I teach at a small school in the same state and associate profs average only 54k. There are plenty of small schools in NC that pay crap. People are often stuck and can't get out. The Admin. know this. It is hardto move from a SLAC to even a mid-tier reseach school unless you do it early in your career. I have been trying to get out for 5 yrs.   7) There are 2 internal candidates also competing for this position  8)  How do you know this #7?  Can't easily tell from their website. 9) #7 here; a friend of a friend asked someone in the biology department about these positions; 3 years ago 2 conservation biologists were hired for 2-3 year positions, and told that after that the positions would be open nationwide. Not sure if these people are applying or not, but potentially there are 2 inside runners that have been there awhile. 10) Huh, this place is just weird all the way around. 11) Some have noted that they have been contacted via e-mail and asked two questions.  What are the two questions? 12) they asked what new classes we would develop and what sort of research program we would develop. Did anyone who applied NOT get the questions?  13) I applied and did not get the questions, but I did mention both of those things in my application materials, so idk what that means for me. 14) I mentioned those things in my application too but I got the email questions - I think they sent them to out to everyone they're considering, although it sounds like that's a lot of people.15) to #4.  There are two reasons you see people at a place a long time.  either they like it there, or they are unable to leave.  When you teach at a dumpster fire for a few years, you are no longer competitive on the job market. This was told to me once by a professor who once worked at a dumpster fire, and took and intructor post to get out, then wendt directly to assoc professor after a year.  Had been tenured at a SLAC at a salary that probably today would be around ~40K.  ","Aww man, I got sorted to the bottom of the ""Anon Quals"" page.

Declare a gender that's early in the alphabet and youll move to the head of the class. 3) Yeah, you should go Tootsie - but avoid falling in love with any of your collegues after you get the job. 4) Or just do good science and move to the head of the class. ",NA,NA,"Tenure-track vs continuing track What's the difference between tenure-track and continuing track? Is continuing track just a way to say non-tenure track? 2) Yes, usually.  Often continuing tracks will be something like 3-year contracts that are renewed annualy.  If they don't mention tenure then I wouldn't count on it. 3) In some countries (such as Australia), faculty jobs are advertised as either ""fixed term"" or ""continuing"". Continuing provides pretty good jobs security (they'll keep you unless you don't perform or they cut the department and it's a permanent contract, not rolling term contracts), but tenure in the US sense doesn't really exist in Aus.","Scheduled to be picked up at the hotel at 7:30am by search chair for my interview. My period hits without warning like a goddamn water cannon at 7:25am. Thankfully I had supplies on me, but that's some bad luck. 2) I've had to clandestinely take meds in the bathroom to keep me from bleeding everywhere during an interview, because ""I may or may not get my period then"" seemed like a weird reason to decline the suggested interview date. Through some bizarre magic, I at least didn't get a migraine that month. 3) Sympathies!! That sucks :( It's bad enough when trying to be on your ""best"" whilst also worrying about migraines, puking etc. in front of the people you are trying to impress. 4) @2, you do want to be at your best, so I would decline to interview then for medical reasons (no need to specify what type of medical reason, and SC should not ask as this is a protected category). 5) Given the confidence interval required, I'd be concerned it would influence them, even if they never asked for details. 6) Let's be honest, period sucks (I am a woman) but we should stop let it affect our professional life so badly. We have medications now. So, if you get hired what, you won't teach for a week every month? If you do fieldwork or fieldcourse or workshops (they may last several weeks), are you letting your male colleauges know you can't work because you have your period (alias, you are a woman)? (Wo)man it up women and go rule the world instead of keep complaining about your period. Coming from a work-class family, there is no way my mom would not go to work because of her period. I have learnt from strong women. Just be grateful you got an interview and go kill! 7) There is a huge difference between teaching and being on peak performance while interviewing. There is no need to be callous towards people who actually have disabling periods (not all of whom may be women, by the way). I'm going to go ahead and assume yours doesn't give you neurological problems. 8) I have been in the job market long enough that neurological problems provided by my period are nothing in comparison. 9) I feel you number 1; not currently having periods but I am trying to hide a very obvious pregnant belly during interviews. At some point I'm just going to have to tell the committees if I get interviews later on. Sorry, guys, can't walk and breathe at the same time but please still give me a job cause this momma needs to pay for childcare. Not willing to put my life on hold for this crap-shoot. 10) Really #8, you can't see because you're on the job market? 11) I went on numerous interviews while 7 months pregnant - even had to schedule one early because I was up against the ""no travel allowed"" limit.  Obviously there was no hiding it at that point, but I ended up getting offers at several places so it can be done!  (or maybe they were all just really desperate to NOT look discriminatory?  hoping not...) 12) yes, all of these things are challenging. have spent some interview time pumping breastmilk and it is also just extra stress that adds to an already stressful situation - luckily I had awesome support from the admin staff and people at that institution were very kind, I hope you all have the same good luck 13) Number 9 again, you women rock! I figure if it's a place that doesn't like the fact that I had a baby 6 months before the start date than I don't want to be at that place anyways. 14) My period always got delayed under stress so I was thinking I won't have a problem with my carefully chose on-site interview time. I was wrong - my period was EARLY (first time in my life) and that was my first day of interview. Anyway, adrenaline was my friend and things turned out fine. Hope 1) had a great interview!  15) I remember franticallly digging in my bag to find that one lone tampon when ""Surprise!!"" Schedule full of nothing but men and trying to figure out excuses to talk to any other female I could find to beg for them to help me get what I needed.   Universities need to get on the free emergency stash.  Either that or actually stock those friggin vending machines.  As if everyone carries quarters all the time. 16) I err on the side of a menstrual cup sometimes. Slightly apprehensive that my new extended cycle birth control could surprise me with breakrthrough bleeding at the next interview.","late posts AP: Some folks seem to get upset by jobs posted past the deadline. I understand that we shouldn't encourge freeriders, but there are some valid reasons why this might happen: maybe the poster just found the wiki or originally thought the position was outside its scope. So let's not reply to each one chastising the poster and assume they're in good faith. And don't forget to keep adding jobs when you find them!",NA,"non-TT Assistant Prof I am in a non-tenure track position but my job title is ""Assistant Professor"". I am applying to tenure track positions and wondering if it is advisable to specifiy that I am in a non-tenure Assistant Prof position? Or just say ""Assistant Professor""? I am pretty happy where I am at and we have an extended contract system but there are some benefits applying for a TT at this other Uni. My thought is if the search committee sees that I am in a non-tenure track position it is clear why I'm looking at their TT position.  2) I would put Assistant Professor (Non-Tenure Track), as you say, to signal why you're applying. 3) I'd definitely note that it is non-tenure track or risk looking like you're not being completely honest. 4) Indicate that your position is non-TT by listing it as Assistant Professor (non-TT) or something like that. You want to make sure reviewers look at you appropriately and scale their standards (which will be lower for a non-TT than a TT). If they assume you are TT then they may feel you haven't been productive. At the same time, they may look at you as a non-TT and think you've been very productive! 5) OP here, thanks for the feedback! I'll add ""non-TT"" in my job title to clarify. I have received one research grant (which are transferable), published 2 papers, 3 papers are in review, and have a full teaching load (averge to above average student evals), so here is hoping the search committee thinks I've been very productive! 6) I am in exactly the same situation. I use 'Assistant Professor' in my cover letter but in italics under the title on my CV, I clarify that I am non-tenure-track but in a full-time, promotable faculty position. On the one hand, you don't want to look like you're lying about being on the tenure track -- but on the other hand, you don't want to look like you're an adjunct. I was also advised recently by a colleague who is a department chair and has served on many committees, to clarify up front that I am not tenure track, because otherwise search committees might be wary that I could want to come up for tenure early.",NA,"Worth applying to less prestigious SLACs? There's been a lot of press lately about SLACs struggling with enrollment, especially ones in New England and the Midwest that aren't top tier. I know these schools are appealing to folks who are more interested in teaching-focused jobs than research-focused jobs, but is it worth applying to institutions that are struggling? 2) Enrollment is going down everywhere, even at R1's. When the education bubble bursts, small schools will close and merge, there is no doubt. I think the metrics to look at are the endowments, the proportion of students in pre-med or medical-track degree programs (especially those with advanced-care practitioner degrees like PA and NP programs), and the number of non-tt new hires that are teaching major courses. If the first two are high and the third low, I think you should be in good shape. Most schools are phasing out tenure by installing non-tt positions. Some schools have taken tenure away from the entire faculty at once. If you are willing to work with short to medium-term contracts, there will still be jobs out there for you if your university goes under. 3) I wouldn't worry. Most people use shitty LACS as stepping stones to better universities anyway. 4) @3, I don't think that is true. Or at least it often doesn't work out if people try to do that. The problem is that at some of those struggling LACs the teaching load is so high and resources so low that you are unlikely to be competitive to move anywhere unless you get out very quickly. I think 2's advice is sound. You really need to look at each school case-by-case to figure out how bad their prospects are. 5) there are some non-factual statements in #2s comment though ""Most schools are phasing out tenure by installing non-tt positions"". This simply isn't true. Some schools are hiring more non-tt positions but tt positions are still being hired. 6) It depends a bit on geography and whether the school is public or private. Enrollments are projected to decline until roughly 2030, at least, but some states are losing more people and others are gaining people. I'd use some real caution about private colleges in parts of the Midwest and New England. 7) I wouldn't take the advice of 5 without doing some background reading, they are not up-to-date on the tenure track statistics. About 73% of faculty position are now non-tenured. Here are some sources that could be have been found by spending one minute on google:  https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2018/10/12/about-three-quarters-all-faculty-positions-are-tenure-track-according-new-aaup;  https://tomprof.stanford.edu/posting/951;  http://www.lawcha.org/2017/01/09/decline-faculty-tenure-less-oversupply-phds-systematic-de-valuation-phd-credential-college-teaching/.  8) Do keep in mind that the data in the insidehighered article include graduate student assistnats - looking more closely at the data, it appears that there are still more TT jobs than non-tenured positions at the institutions to which most of us are applying.  Not a rosy ppicture, but not as dire as the article title suggests. 9) Yes. How many adjuncts or grad students are teaching English 101 or some online MBA courses is important in a broad sense but not particularly insightful for biology departments. 10) Biology departments weren't the question. Focus. 11) <- no need for that. The conversation shifted a bit, as they sometimes do, to a related aspect of faculty hiring. Don't be reviewer 2. 12) Must you resort to namecalling here 11? 13) You could either blame reviewers or practice writing better. 14) 11 please try to keep it ""civil & productive"""

Good idea? Bad idea? 2) I'm not into it. First, it might come off as bragging. Second, while some might appreciate impact metrics, others might be strongly against their use. Seems like the potential cons or harm outweigh the pros of including. But, to each their own. I'm sure it can and is done tastefully. 3) I put it right at the bottom of the first page of my CV, right before my pubs: # 1st authored pubs, total #, h', # cites per year/per pub, and average impact factor of pubs. Is it obnoxious overkill? Maybe for some, but if someone is concerned about it, they'll like that I put the info on there, plus it only takes up 1 line in my CV. 4) If applying to R1s, definitely. SLACs? No. (5) I included my impactstory link, which provides more useful info 6) I disagree with #2. You are supposed to be bragging, if you start worrying about that you are going to get overlooked for people who truelly sell themselves well, so I would say don't hold back. Granted, don't make an h-index of 2 sound like you are lighting the world on fire, but metrics allow you to show QUANTITATIVELY how impactful your research is. So if it is a decent number, I would put it right in your cover letter (i.e. ""I have published in journals xxx, and my reesearch has been well cited (h-index = 7)"" or some such). 7) I think it is really difficult to actually count accurately how many times you've been cited, which makes the H-index fairly useless. Google definitely misses a lot of places where I know I'm cited, and it has a lot of double counts, etc. too. Do you all really know how many times each of your papers has been cited? What are you using to count? 6) I agree that Google Scholar #s are inflated, esp since they count non-peer reviewed citations, like theses and dissertations. However, I generally just use their metrics as your Scholar page is the summary search committees are most likely to look at, and it is easy to find/access. I don't like using Web of Science because it is incredibly slow at updating publications (usually months behind Scholar). 7) if you download Harzing's Publish or Perish, you can get some really good indexes.  Specifically, there is one caled the m-score and it is your h-index score divided by years since your first pub.  IT is a really good metric for comparing people.  The actual paper that introduces it stats that if your first paper was actually years before you started publishing.  (maybe you were on a paper as an undergrad, but did not start publishing until 10 years later), you should probably eliminate that from your dataset to geve a true adjusted m score.  I have found that putting this on helps (for me at least) when applying to mid-tier schools. It hurts at schools that are largely assembly line diploma mills, and it can go either way at R1s.  I think this might be because people at pure teaching schools don't like research and don't want researchers around to give the Admin ideas, whereas those in R1s largely can look at your pubs and know/tell how good they are.  At mid-tier schools there is less duplication, so people may be remotely familiar with your journals and your field, but they may also be wanting a research active person.  This is the kind of school I want to work at, so I tend to be extra attentive to those applications! :)","You know, people say this every year, but there are a stupid number of candidates on the market! I hate this sh!t",NA,NA,"Listing alt-ac jobs? My (National Research Lab) employer will be advertising a senior, permanent research position soon. Can I add the details here, and if so, should it go on the Faculty or non-TT page? 2) If it's 6+ yrs, I say faculty page 3) In past years there has been a separate page for research positions. Can we make one of those? 2) I don't think it will get enough use to make it worthwhile. ""Non-TT Jobs"" only has 20. 4) Maybe just put it on the Non-TT job page? 5) Definitely Non-TT page. Several positions on there are 'permanent' so this seems like a fine fit. 6) They are all pretty junior, though. 7) There's a California Academy of Sciences job listed on the Faculty page -- should that be moved? 8) #5 again, I'm not sure what you mean that they are all pretty junior. How is a permanent lecturer position that requires a PhD more 'junior' than a TT assistant prof position? Do you just mean not as appealing? Tenure track/faculty vs. non-tt seems like a pretty clear distinction to me.  9) #2 again: I don't think the distinction between ""Faculty Jobs"" and ""Non-TT Jobs"" is clear at all.  I don't know whether curators can be tenure-track, but I wouldn't be surprised.  To me the main difference is ""continuing appointment"" (tenure-track faculty, permanent lecturers, curators) vs ""fixed-term appointment"" (postdocs, short-term teaching faculty).  That is, would you consider buyng a house if you got that position? 10) I see your point, but in my mind the key distinction is that those jobs may be 'permanent', but if they are not tenure track then permanent likely just means until grant funding runs low or budgets get cut or universities change priorities or the PI retires, etc. Also, many of the lecturer jobs on the non-tt track page are permanent. Actually they are likely more permanent since some include security of employment. I know many people in those positions and they do buy a house once they get them! 11) If you're done when the grant expires, that's not permanent, that's fixed-term.(x2) 12) If you don't consider it TT if the positions could be cut (with redundancy payouts) if a university changes its priorities or has a budget crisis, then most faculty positions outside the US and many in the US don't count as TT either. Whole departments get cut if there's no money/not enough student enrolment for a few years 13) RE: Cal Academy jobs: curator positions at major museums are generally TT. 14) Museum curator jobs are typically ranked starting at assistant curator, associate curator, and full curator, just like a univeristy TT system. 15) Although California Academy of Sciences does not offer a secured ""tenured"" position, they force curators out. 16) Could the previous poster clarify what is meant by forcing curators out? Are they forced out by CAS, or do they leave because they do not have the option for tenure at CAS, or something else?","Job season makes it hard to manage professional friendships.

Do people present an large survey of their past work or simply focus on a couple of papers/topics? Is the research job talk much different than an R1? I have seen R1 talks but never job talks at primarilly teaching schools.  As a general rule, at an SLAC job talk the students should be your target audience.  You need to make the talk accessible to them, or you are demonstrating a lack of institutional understanding.  Think of it more as a hybrid teaching-research talk.  I have seen a fair number of candidates make this mistake and give an extremely technical R1 seminar-like job talk.  It doesn't go over well with the search committee, no matter how impressive your pedigree or research.  2) OP here...thanks. I think that I have made that mistake. 3) At MS-level places, it really depends on how research-focused they are. If they're hiring someone to cover a 5/5 load, they'll be more interested in the teaching and want a talk geared towards students. If they're hiring a ""chemical ecologist with interests in hymenoptera,"" they're expecting an R1-type research seminar. See thread below about the variability of MS-level places. 3) Often you'll be asked to give 2 talks: a research seminar (technical - but know your audience) and a teaching seminar (i.e., teach a class on topic ""x"" to students). 4) OP here...thanks everyone. I have interviewed at a couple of SLACs now...At some places there are two talks while at others there is one research talk. 5) my SLAC on-site asked for a teaching presentation on topic ""x"" that also incorporated my own research.  at first I was kind of intimidated but now that I've done it I realize it's actually a great format for SLAC type talks. 6) #5 -- that sounds really perfect actually. From a candidate's perspective, it is better than just doing a random lecture (you should know a lot about the topic). It is also better than doing two talks.  7) Just adding my experience here.  At SLACs two talks (one teaching demo, one research talk) is a common interview format.  At top SLACs (say, top-50), the research talk is expected to be pretty advanced, but certainly designed such that non-specialists can follow what you do.  But I'd argue that this should be your goal for ANY research talk.  Even at an R1, if you lose most of the audience because your talk is too technical, you've done a bad job.",NA,"So this is the best year in at least four years? 1) Scenario: I did not receive rejection on a past date as another noted nor did I have an interview. Question: What's the general ""story"" with that type of situation? Obviously, I'm unlikely to get the job, but why notify some but not others? What's going on at the level of Search Committee? 2) The person that got the rejection most likely didn't even come close to what they were looking for.  Your application, on the other hand, sounds like it's still in play.  They don't want to burn the bridge with you yet in case whoever their first round of interviewees are all turn out to be duds, so, sounds like you are still in the game. 3) I had the same thing last year and was told later I was sub-shortlist and sort of considered for backup.

(x2),"Spouse Hire I am curious to know how the negotation about spouse hire works. I am in a relationship but not legally married. Can I ask for it? My partner is an assistant professor in mathematics. He'll get tenured in about a year. What kind of position an institution can grant for him?  2) Many schools have an official partner hire program. Usually the President or Dean pays 1/3-1/2 salary, the hiring dept pays another portion, and the receiving dept pays the rest.  They still have to sell the candidate to the dept, but it will be an easier decision.  Usually the bar is set as whether your spouse would make an interview list with a CV like that.  Be prepared to get creative about what dept if there is pushback. (Will stats work?  Physics?) Ask AFTER you get the offer so no one uses it against you.   Ask if they have an official program.  If not, ask how they have worked it out before.   Some schools are more likely to give a spose a pdoc or soft money, especially if they are more junior.  Schools outside of big cities are more likely to work it out.  If they give you a soft money position, your spouse should apply to EVERY elligible faculty position that appears in the next 3 years.  3) Along these same lines, what if the partner question comes up before an offer is made? I know they legally can't ask about it - but some people in my field know my partner and i can't just say ""no."" 4) Here #1, thanks for your comments. My questions were mosty these: can I ask for a spouse hire if I am not legally married? In case they agree with my request, what kind of position have usually a spouse granted if he/she basically already tenured?  5) You can ask spousal hire even if you are not married, but they can also say no. I think university hire policy/culture is an more important factor of your spousal hire, rather than your marrige certificate.  If your spouse is a rising star or has a much better CV than this university's pretenure professors (or you are much better than their pretenure professors), he or she may be granted to tenure. Otherwise, I think uinversity may be even hestitate to give your spouse even an assistent professor. They may accomendate a one-two year visiting professor or lecturer postion. 6) Thanks. I had no idea that a regular position could be granted without regular job posting, selection of candidates, interview, etc. 7) #6 it totally depends on the institution. Some will still have to advertise and do some hoop jumping for a spousal hire.   8) The main criterion ought to be whether or not you refuse to move without your partner.  But I'd bump that s/o up to fiance(e) for the sake of negotiations.  I did see one case where admins replied that they wouldn't do it for an unmarried (straight) couple.  Jen went home and immediately proposed.   They got the spousal hire. 8) Interesting. Although it doesn't make sense to me. What's the point of spending thousands of dollar for a useless ring. If I get the job offer I will buy a $2 ring and tell the SC he proposed me. Then go back to our happy life marriage- and other society imposition-free. I am among the minority of women who finds disqualifying a man who is into all these habits about engagment and proposals 9) Who said anything about needing a ring? x2  10) I don't understand how you would prove the school you are engaged otherwise. 11) I don't think they are going to ask to see your ring for proof (it wouldn't prove anything anyway). I know that some places will not consider partner hires without marriage, but others will. I guess saying you are engaged makes it seem a little more serious that you need both jobs in the eyes of some people, but I'd be surprised if just saying that really made the difference between a partner offer or not. I think you would do just as well by just explaining the nature and commitment of your relationship and the fact that you don't plan to be married. Plus, I wouldn't want to lie about the engagement and get the job then show up next year and have the faculty/chair who went to bat for you realize you were deceiving them.   8) Usually it's not the faculty/chair that govern the upper admin response to a spousal hire's commitment.  They usually are the one already backing the hire.  I've seen it declined and then suddenly fixed upon ""engagement"".  I think that admin was a dick, and possibly discrimnatory.  And no, I've never seen an admin ask to see a picture of the ring. ",NA,"First name or Dr. ?  Silly question but I want to make sure I don't mess up.

If addressed first, I always sign off without a title. 6) Wow, you got ageism, racism, and sexism all in one set of parentheses there. 7) Literally cannot win. Sure, put me down as the bigot against people from an age when titles mattered to put junior colleagues in their place. 8) In my experience it is often women who want to be called Dr. because they're tired of being called Miss, Mrs, Ms, or just their first name. So, maybe the bigotry about people ""from that age"" is misplaced. 9) I always use Dr. in a first communication out of respect. Honestly, I expect the same (and I'm junior). If you don't know me and we are corresponding professionally, you should call me Dr. otherwise it feels too casual and weird and honestly makes me panic for a second that I've met you before and completely can't remember. Now, when I write someone back, I will always sign with my first name. It really is kind of non-sense....but here we are. I'd rather be over-formal than under, just like in interview attire.",NA,"Thank you emails Looking for advice on post-campus interview thank yous. Do you send just to a few people or to everyone you met with? 1) Everyone x4 2) Either send to the chair of search and thank everyone in that letter/note OR thank everyone you met with and make sure you don't leave anyone out x2  3) Some interviews you meet 40+ people, which would be ridiculous.  I chose to thank the SC and Host, asking them to pass on my thanks to everyone else. 4) I do anyone I had a meaningful interaction with, and DEF everyone on the search committee and dept chair. 5) Is sending thank-you emails the convention? Is this why I haven't gotten offers?? 6) Offers here with no thank you letters. Don't worry. (x2) 7) No offers here with a ton of thank-you letters.X2 8) Offers here with thank you letters x 2. Seems there is no rule. 9) Thank you notes almost certainly will not affect your likelihood to get an offer one way or the other but they could help build/maintain social niceties with folks after the interview (even if you don't get an offer/accept). So do them if they feel right to you, but don't stress about it. 10) #9. That actually worked for me. I was skype-interviewed but did not get an on-campus interview. I wrote a very nice thank you letter. The next year, another position opened up and the committee member invited me to apply and eventually I got an offer. Be nice and polite to everyone and sometimes it will be reciprocated. 11) On the other hand, my boss is a complete !@#$ and they got their job easily because the committee thought that confidence and arrogance correlated with talent and smarts.12) always write thank yous, small cost to you and the absence of them could be interpretted as lack of interest. 13) Just adding, I sent one email to the SC to thank them for the opportunity and for arranging/escorting/etc.; then separate, short emails to everyone I met with.

(5) Different campus.  But still...",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Sorting of Vacancies 1) Hi folks, it seems like a lot of questions here could be answered with the anon quals tab used in previous years. I went ahead and added one for this year. Remember your number and update as necessary. Hopefully it helps to see where you stand! 2) I mean no disrespect but I think this is most useless page. It doesn't tell you where you stand. First, you have no idea on the honesty of the postings. Second, this isn't your competition as they may or may not be applying at similar institutions. Third, you have no idea of the specificity (For example, are the pubs in Ecology Letter, Oikos, or the Great Basin Naturalist). SCs don't just blindly count lines of pubs on a CV...do you have a research program? The best thing to do is to pick a handful of schools in the tier/location you are looking to apply and see who they have hired in the last 5 years or so. This will give you a good idea of where you stand. Also, figuring out where you stand is not too useful at the end of the job application season. Have someone you trust look over your CV if nothing works out this year. Try to fill in those gaps. This page just creates unnecessary anxiety or outrage because you feel you are more qualified. 3) Number 1 here again: While some of your arguments are valid, I see that at least 7 others already agree to its utility having filled in their information. If you don't like it, simply don't use it. There are several lines of discussion on this page that could easily be addressed by someone checking out the tab. People are just as likely to be honest in both places, but at least this way we'll have an updated view of everything. This was also extremely useful at the end of the season last year to tally up how many people were using the wiki and how many of them got jobs. Finally, I'm getting a bit tired of the agressive responses on here that start with things like ""Not to be disrespectful, but..."" (referencing also the 7/23 comment which was directed at myself). Let's all try to get along and play nice; this is meant to be a supportive resource and it will only conitnue to work if we practice some decorum. 4) It is a non-random, self-reporting, biased survey that has also has all the caveats that I mentioned above. It therefore does not provide an accurate distribution of the qualifications with which you are competing. There are much better ways to do so. I am just stating my opinion and really do think that the page lacks utility and can even be detrimental. I think it is useful to point this out so some people don't stress out about that page. (I stressed out about that page a lot last year.) Not sure why that breaks rules of decorum. 5) It is useful, just take it for what it is, caveats, warts and all. 6) First time using the Wiki. I like the anon quals page! But maybe we can add a column for which types of schools people are applying to most. (later) I added that column for type of schools. This will really help me compare myself with the right people. 6) For those unhappy with qualifying the types of pubs, why not add an H-index tab? That'll at least get at something.",shit,NA,NA,"tailoring the application I tend to tailor the cover letter and leave the research statement intact, but I wonder what others think... It's a tricky issue I know (some say they never read the cover letter!) 2) Never read the cover letter? Why did I just spend hours on mine? ugh! I also tailor a paragraph in my RS to the university field stations if they ask for it. 3) I hear of some committees don't read any of the statements until you make the long or short list.  4) Besides the CV, your cover letter is pretty important during the initial screening, as it defines what, exactly, you ""are"". To that end, it should serve as an 'abstract' for your other materials. 5) I always feell like it's my teaching statement and research statement that are going to get skimmed. They get a little bit of tailoring (more so on the research statement, for field stations, research projects that are feasible at that school, etc., ), but the cover letter is always personally written and is a 'highlite list' of the most important parts of my teaching and research statement. 6) Your cover letter is the letter of recommendation you get to write for yourself.  If it's not tailored exquisitely, I look at your CV but may not read anything else. 7) Every document that you submit is a reflection of you. Don't be lazy at any step. 8) I usually skip cover letters at first but come back to them if I'm not sure about a candidate. Especially if it's a case of ""why are they applying?"" (e.g. slightly out of discipline or a little over- or under-qualified) A good cover letter can make the difference.","Step 1) agonize over an application to your first choice school. Step 2) Get short listed for said school. Step 3) Tell references HOW important this app is for you; give them specific info about exactly what the)  SC said they are looking for in the letter. Step 4) Get two letters submitted within 48 hours. Step 5) Send countless emails over the next two weeks to PhD advisor reminding about the letters due date. Step 6) Watch helplessly as the due date goes by and no letter is submitted. Step 7) Wonder why I bother. 8) Unless SC tells you that late letters kill your application, I wouldn't worry about it. Everyone knows letters take forever. 9) I came here to write thie exact same post - dear god, why is my beloved PhD advisor dropping the ball on this!!! X2 10) #1 here, Exactly, #9. I love my advisor. WHY DOESNT SHE LOVE ME BACK. 11) My Ph.D. advisor did this to me on TWO applications this year.  Advisor turns them in and I get rejection letters within hours from both....so, that was fun. 12) I gave up asking my PhD advisor, he was barely able to ask me to write it so he culd sign it. Unfortunately, I am not very able to brag myself. 13) Mine just sent me an email two days before a fellowship app was due (you know, just in case it probably doesn't work this year) and said he was just done with trying to figure out an online system for submitting. That's it. Great. Had to find someone else one day before it was due. I'm still pissed. ","Q I don't have a strong publication record (1 1st from 2008, 5 co-authorships, nothing from PhD) and feel super inferior. Has anyone been asked in interviews to explain their publication history. I also have had my share of personal challendges (husband had cancer 3rd year of PhD needed 100 days in hosptial and a stem cell transplant; newborn spent 100+ days in ICU) that have impacted my productivity but would never bring it up and fear a question about my publication reccord because I don't know how much to say or not say.  2) I am so sorry #1 how difficult to have this experiences. I wion ould ask my advisor to address it in his/her recommendation letter. For example ""despite my student having challenging times with family illnessess, (s)he has shown her work ethics and did A,B,C. I imagine that is a good way to put things on perspective. 3) I see people hired with a very low publication record. Others having problems with a strong record. I think it is very random and anyone has the own weaknesses. For example, I basically have no teaching experience, and honesttly I too have personal reasons that justifies it. Keep applying, some schools are not very interested in papers. Make your application stronger in what you have instead of addressing weaknesses. Do you have teaching experience? Do you go to conferences? Have you mentored? I am fairly productive in terms of paper, but completely ignored by undergraduate colleges, SLAC, and departments with a faculty that doesn't publish very much. I noticed, those schools that ignored me hired people with almost no papers 4) If they interview you, it's probably not a dealbreaker. Should they ask, it's probably a good idea to have an answer plotted out. I heard from someone on a SC about a candidate who had a publication gap but was cagey about addressing the reasons, so it was hard for them to extend the benefit of the doubt. 5) It is so easy to compare yourself to other people in this field and during a job hunt. This wiki makes it really easy, too.  After all, that’s the name of the game – who can get the attention of the search committee. It is important to know who the competition is for the purpose of selling yourself. But, it is not useful to allow other’s accomplishments to make you feel bad about your own progress. Your application should sell you with all of your skills and when you complete a packet, feel good about what you have accomplished. The only way to improve your publication record is to do more research and produce more publications, which takes time. I hope that you are in a position to do that and in the meantime, keep your head up and continue applying. I am in the same position right now as most of the projects I have worked on had no funding and are cobbled together. The results are definitely relevant, but more difficult to publish. Allowing that to make me feel like I’m not a good researcher isn’t useful to my end goal of securing a permanent position somewhere. It is more useful to be confident about the things I have done well and what I have to offer an employer. 6) I know several people who have secured positions at excellent R1s in the past couple years, and none of them had publication numbers like what you see on the Anon Quals page - I'm not sure they were even into the double digits. 7) Thanks for that 6! The anon quals page intimidates me! 8) AQ tab self-selcts for overachievers 8) See https://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2017/01/04/you-cant-tell-much-about-your-odds-of-getting-an-interview-for-a-faculty-position-from-common-quantitative-metrics/ and https://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2017/10/17/a-crude-statistical-profile-of-the-research-productivity-of-recently-hired-tt-n-american-ecology-faculty/. Self-reported quals on the anon quals page, and of recently-hired N. American asst profs of ecology, vary a *lot*, even just among hires at the same type of institituion or even the same dept. The quals of the recently-hired faculty and anonymous quals page folks also overlap a lot. And those quals have no predictive power for how many interviews and offers you'll get. Not because offers are given at random or only to well-connected ""insiders"", but because offers are given based on factors that vary from search to search and that aren't well captured by crude metrics like # of publications, # of classes taught, h index, etc. Quite understandable to be intimidated by the anon quals page, or the quals of recent ecology faculty hires--but try not to be.   <== Thanks!! 9) Don't read too much into the anon qualifications page. Agree with #8 that there is a lot of variation. I only have four first author papers but was hired at an R1. Just present your future research clearly and be really nice and friendly to everyone at your interviews.",NA,"Listing all conference talks in CV Do you guys list every single one of your conference talks in your CV? I think that's fine for more early career people, but as real publications start to add up (20+ in my case), it sounds so minor to add each single conference talk with title and authors that I wonder if it's worth the space it takes. Plus, a lot of my conference talks have similar titles (reflecting ongoing stages of a same project) that I feel embarassed to list all of them next to each other. Maybe a reminder to diversify on titles a bit... 2) I just list contributed talks by meeting without titles (e.g., ESA, 2010-2018), but I still include titles for contributed talks. 3) I don't list titles at all. For contributed talks, I list the conference, years, and # oral or poster presentations. I seperate Seminars/Invited talks but just list year and conference/Dept but no title. 4) I have a section where I list dates/locations of invited talks (most of which have been departmental seminar type things), but not titles.  I do have a section of ""Conferences I have presented at"" and just list conference title and year, like ""Evolution 2012 - """,NA,"Location Options Moved from Faculty Jobs: ""It is weird listing north american and european positions by country/state and listing other places by continent. South America is huge. Chile is a country, as huge as Texas. x4 Also Chile is extremeley far away from say Colombia, so writing South America is like saying ""job somewhere in North America"" I bet people care to know if if it's Canada, USA or Mexico. 3) It's probably just done to keep the dropdown list of locations manageable, since barely any jobs in SA get posted here. 4) The list is clearly focused first on the US (locations by state), second ""developed"" countries (locations by country), and last ""developing"" countries (locations by contitnent). 5) I understand this list is mostly by and for N American folks, so it makes sense to be spectific on the location in NAm, but in my opinion it would be more appropriate if we could also list the country for positions based in Africa, SAm, Asia, the same way we can specify the country in Europe. 5) I agree with @4. Another column (maybe ""continent"") can be included for filtering purposes. 6) agree that continent is vague, but easy to find out by clicking on URL - and there *are* more jobs posted here from either Kentucky or Connecticut (to name random states) than the entire continents of Asia and S.

LOL + 3 11) @8 Yes, please, Americans, never leave your country. Leave those countries you don't care about alone so they can make use of their own potato energy. 12) Is this anti or pro American? Its so convoluted. 13) I guess Americans might struggle to understand that @11 was anti-American. 14) Hey, just because people may write English as a second language you shouldn't automatically assume people won't understand them. That's disgraceful. Only in an anonymous forum can people feel so emboldened to write such racist remarks. 15) very unwoke indeed 16) @14 & @15, I wrote both 11 & 13 comments, and English is my second language. My point in comment 13 was in response to @12 and what I meant was that Americans, whose English language skills are not always that great (tongue in cheek... or not), are unable to see when there are critisized for the same reasons they don't see that not including the names of the countries on the list here is disrespectful. But I am racist and unwoke... you guys are so funny. 17) Its important to remember that the moderators are just people, and I highly doubt they were being intentionally racist. Clearly this site have become extremely popular because of its usefulness and has expanded beyond the initial audience- who were likley mostly Americans looking for jobs in America. This vertue singaling and calling each other ""unwoke"" is not solving any actual problems. +1. 18) Listing 195 individual countries on the drop-down list would be dumb, given that there are jobs from MAYBE 20 countries posted per year, with 1 or 2 per country the norm. Prove me wrong and post those ads from Malta or Sri Lanka or wherever that merits their inclusion on the list. 19) People using the internet to voice displeasure with the spread of American technology   AP) I don't like stifling discussion, but this thread doesn't seem to be going anywhere useful.  Suffice it to say, academia is international and I'm glad that this wiki doesn't focus solely on North American jobs.  All countries are welcome and when we get repeated postings from some place not explicitly named, we will try to add them to the options. x2."

Hadn't seen that yet. 3) Yeah that will be interesting. It would be great if they could find a method for deducing genders of initial offers (i.e., 1st choice for searches). That in my opinion would be more interesting... 3) I also would be interested to see how this relates to the number of women already on the faculty as I could see it going both ways: schools with high numbers of women continue to attract and retain women (positive relationship) or faculties with few women are making an extra effort to bring them in (negative relationship). ",NA,"Phone Interview with President I was just scheduled to have a phone interview with a campus president after my on campus interview (yet to occur) Has any one had this experience before and have any suggestions? Thanks! 1) Is it a small school? Never heard of this, but I doubt it's a bad sign!  2) I've only heard of this with religious schools.  If it is, then be very careful what you say and how to phrase any comments about religion or lifestyle.  Regardless, be friendly, and enthusiastic about the school and location. 3)  I had to meet with a President once and, as #2 indicated, it was a religious school.  I was then chosen to be the one they wanted, but the President blocked me from being hired, because of our interaction.  The main problem was that my in-laws were Adventists, I was raised Catholic, and it was a Baptist school. 4) Religion sucks.   2 again) In one case a woman wasn't hired at a religious school after telling the president she was gay and married.  The next year another friend got the hire.  She was careful not to mention during the meeting that her sister was gay. Not all religious schools do that, but many do.  Just be aware and consider carefully whether it is the right fit for you. 5) I'm a new faculty at a Methodist school and actually went out of my way to ask a younger faculty member (during a one-on-one) about campus climate and outed myself to make sure that wouldn't be an issue (I wouldn't have taken the job if it would have been an issue). Word got around quick and when I had my meeting with the campus president (last meeting of the day), he ended our exchange with ""Just so you know, Methodists love everybody and everyone is welcome on this campus"". So your mileage will vary with these meetings. I made sure to be very respectful and even brought up that I was raised Baptist (though didn't mention current affiliation), but didn't hide my orientation on purpose.  6)  Methodists are different creatures than Southern Baptists or Adventists.  Much more welcoming. 7) I hope I get to work in a place where being welcoming is not suprising. I have applied to religious schools as well just to increase the opportunities, but although I was raised catholic, I am a proud atheist    2) You're warming my heart #5. 8) I have gotten a meeting with the president at both SLACs I had campus interviews for. One was definitely not a religous school (athiesm is in their motto) and one was a religous school where the president specifically asked me about my religous views, but in a weird underhanded way. Luckily t he faculty warned me that he does that in every meeting with job candidates so I was prepared. Apparently it wasn't meant as a litmus test, but rather a question to see if you're interested in engaging in debate. Either way, I found it to be fairly strange. 9) I had a phone interview with a college president of an R2 type school after an on-campus interview. But the only reason was that his calendar was messed up and he missed me for in-person. Didn't think too much of it -- mostly similar to an asst. Dean mtg OP) Hi all, thanks for the comments-I appreciate it! This is for a small Catholic school so I appreciate the heads-up. I'll let you know how it goes! ",NA,"Is the big push over? Just graphed the dates/accumulation; looks like its been levelling off since ~mid-December; is this normal? I know these are largely seasonal, but since this is my first year applying in earnest, wondering if the vast majority have posted so far. Thanks. 2) Looking at the last couple years, there is a pause for the last couple weeks in December, then more in January.  I expect 100-150 more positions, but most from lower ranking universities. 3) Definitely normal for a winter break lull. As 2 says, more TTs from mid- to lower-ranked unis will start showing up, but new postings will also start to skew toward visiting positions. Some of those will be at higher ranked schools. 4) Yes, high-ranking institutions will also post occassionally; there are recent entries in the Faculty tab for jobs at UC Davis, Princeton, Penn State, and the American Museum of Natural History. ",NA,"What will you do if no interviews/offers this year, and your current position is ending? 1) Look for a job in the industry, I guess  2) Or 2nd pdoc if you are early in your career. If research institutes are an option (Scrips, Broad, NIH, etc) they have more mid-level researcher positions you could move to.  That would give you an intermediate to build your CV a little more.  3) OP here, I know this question will vary depending on personal preference and background. Another postdoc is an option, but do you apply at the same time you are applying for faculty jobs (that seems tacky?). I like the suggestion of targeting research institutes... but in my field these positions are also hard to get. Has anyone heard of taking a gap year, finishing papers, and applying for the next year's cycle? Would an unemployment gap hurt you in the eyes of a search committee? 4) I don't think it's tacky to apply for both postdocs and faculty at the same time. I've been doing it so I am employed continously...?  5) Run it by your potential advisor.  It's easy enough to defer 1 yr and most people understand the job market.   I don't recommend applying 1st months of your first pdoc, since it's a time sink and unlikely to happen without postdoc papers. 6) I got an on-campus interview after submitting an application the first month of my first postdoc, didn't get the job but was good experience. If you seem like a good fit I recommend submitting an application, yes, it was a time sink but I worked on my application material on two separate weekends and I've had everything ready ever since. I'm starting my 3rd y as a postdoc, still have no postdoc papers. Last year I got no on campus interviews but this year I've had 2 so far. Having postdoc papers is not a good indicator of whether you'll get interviews or not. I do want to point out that I have a good publication record from my PhD and I'm still publishing stuff from my PhD. 7) Agree with 6, if there are jobs that are a good fit apply even early in a postdoc. I don't think it is tacky at all to apply for faculty jobs and other postdocs at the same time, though a lot of the grant funded postdocs tend to be advertised later after most faculty searches are past so you may have another chance after assessing job search results. Regarding a gap year: some universities if you go through the right channels will be able to make a courtesy appointment or something similar when your postdoc funding runs out so that you can still list yourself as a postdoc and use university resources like journal subscriptions. Of course that only works if you can really afford not to be paid for a while, but might be a better option than just trying to get papers out from home. 8) Agree with #4 et al. If you don't get a faculty job do they expect you to starve? 2nd postdoc sometimes (often) the only option to stay in academia. Also agree with #7 but this can be challenging depending how long it lasts. 9) Second for applying for TT jobs at all times. Your main job as a postdoc is to get permanent employment. Apply early, often, all the time! Not tacky at all. x2 OP) Thanks everyone, helpful to know your strategies! 10) also stats are suggesting in ecology most people are 3-5 yrs post PhD, which seems like 2 postdocs, so not tacky 11) got my eye on a bartending job......

NA,"negotiating a deferment of start date I'd like to get some feedback on deferring an offer. I'm in negotiations with a school and would like to defer my start date for a year. My postdoc work is yielding some really cool results and I'm smack in the middle of some experiments. I know of some folks that have successfully done this and know of one other person who couldn't defer due to pressure from higher-ups. To those that have done this or to any SC members here, what are your thoughts or suggestions about this? 1) It depends.  Very often the department would be more than happy to have you defer for a year: they pocket the salary savings, which can be applied to your startup.  It also gives them more time to ready your space (which still won't be ready!) and they'd rather have a more-experienced you.  In other words, your interests are aligned with the department's.  The only time I've seen reluctance is when they need someone to teach a course right away.  Defer >1 year they might worry about you getting another offer in the meanwhile. 2) Is this an R1 or SLAC or what?  In my experience applying to SLACs - they are looking for someone for a specific reason, like teaching a course or helping out with a heavy advising load, meaning they want the person to start immediately.  It doesn't hurt to ask, though! 3) #1 again: right, my answer was R1-centric, different types of institutions may vary.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,start up ,poop,NA,NA,"The What to Wear dilemma To my fellow female colleages: does anyone have advice on what to wear to campus interviews? Hate that interviews are in the winter! 2) I have seen lots of interviews as a grad student and now postdoc (and lots of them were female candidates, b/c my department is trying to increase diversity), and can now say that none of the job offers went to the well-dressed people. Quite to the contrary! So, I am not sure it even matters (despite what my advisor says). So, yes, I am curious what folks think.  3) My day-to-day wardrobe mirrors the typical field biologist ""look"" so it was tough for me to pick out interview clothes.  All my interviews have been during the winter in temperate areas so I've gone with black pants (from 'Express'), black shoes (nothing fancy), and sweaters with nice tops under them. I favor sweaters that button up the front incase the building temperature is a little on the warm side.  I buy Banana Republic brand tops because they fit me the best and I look professional without looking too dressed-up. + Threadup has secondhand Banana Republic wear for pretty cheap.  Good luck! 4) SLAC faculty tend to dress more formally than R1 EEB departments do, so be aware of that when you're chosing interview clothes. I wore a suit (black pants, colorful blouse, black jacket) to a SLAC interview, and did not feel overdressed at all. I would have been underdressed relative to the faculty had I worn slacks with a sweater. Also, be aware of regional differences. I think east coast and southern schools might be more formal than west coast schools in general, so if you're used to a west coast R1 dress code and interviewing at an east coast SLAC, you may want to dress up more than you think necessary. Finally, wherever you interview, you'll meet with a dean, provost, and at a small school, the president or VP, all of whom will be wearing suits. I think it's better to err on the side of overdressed rather than underdressed. Ecologists won't care what you're wearing as long as your research is kickass, but administrators will.  5) I always wear a jacket to give my seminar no matter where I'm interviewing, but I think the sweater idea is fine, particularly for the day(s) without a seminar. 6) I received an offer at an R2 and I wore sweaters (no suit jacket) / pants the whole interview. 7) https://sociobiology.wordpress.com/2016/10/17/job-interview-how-to-avoid-10-pitfalls/ Not sure about the collarbone advice.  8) what is wrong with my collarbone?!? 9) I appreciate the importance of dressing appropiately but I often find Strassman's comments and advice, well, less than unhelpful. x4 (glad to hear someone else feels the same way about her 'advice'!) 10) I had several interviews in R1 research universities last year, and I got offers from most of the places I interviewed. My personal suggestion is to wear a suit, if you are not comfortable about it, then casual suit. My reason is that I spent the least amount of time worrying about my attire, and suit is formal enough that people know I am the job candidate, which was very important to me because in work place sometimes people mis-recognize me as undergraduate student. Of course other clothes mentioned above was good too, just make sure your clothes are nice, professional, and forgettable. 11) Yoga pants and sports bras for men, board shorts and ""Sun's out, Guns out"" tank tops for women.  Case closed. 11.5)LOL 12) I've been wearing suit pants with blouses, but not the suit jacket. If the interview is more days than I have long-sleeved blouses, I do a short-sleeved blouse with a nice sweater over it for one of the days on which I am not giving my talk(s). I do take the suit jacket with me, though, in case I decide to wear it. (No offer yet, but I did get positive feedback from a few of the interviews.); 13) What about makeup? I almost never wear it, which is pretty normal for scientists in Australia, but am I right in thinking it's uncommon in the US? I'm not confident applying it, so is it better to go without, or to do my best? 14) It seems to be common in my department not to wear makeup, though I would probably err on the side of wearing a small amount over nothing - allegedly it makes people perceive you as more competent. I've done eyeliner (a liquid, water-resistant one that doesn't smudge and make raccoon eyes; Kat von D ink liner is good), matte neutral-coloured eye shadow (think taupe and a touch lighter than skin-toned) and some sheerly applied tinted moisturizer that matches well. 15) Wear it if it will make you feel more confident. Don't wear it if it will distract you or you just don't want to. I think makeup comes down to personal preference in US academia.",https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/academic-job-market-or-terminal-illness <-- ugh/lol,NA,NA,"Physiology Positions It seems like Physiology positions are getting far fewer applicants listed on this wiki compared to other fields such as integrative biology, animal behavior and ecology. Does anyone have an indication if that is because fewer people are actually applying to physiology positions, or instead because fewer physiologists are using this wiki (it is an eco-evo wiki afterall). 2) My guess would be the latter 3) I wonder if there is another wiki for physiologists...I feel like I'm the only one posting them here but I my work does span EEB and physiology. 4) there is this one http://ecophys-jobs.org/faculty.html which isn't a wiki, but a good source.

It seems to me that a lot of unis want vert physiologists for these positions to teach pre-med human phys type courses.

NA,"When the offer finally comes... This is related to the ""I'm going insane"" post on 2-5-2010 in the venting page. For those who have received offers, I'm curious to how you were notified? I ask because I'm currently waiting on the decision from 3 searches and want to know that if offered the position, will I get a phone call during business hours (9am-5pm) on a weekday? Or do SC chairs or department heads call in the evenings and/or weekends? I just want to know so that at the end of day when I leave the lab, I can have beer and relax without being tense about whether or not the SC will call me. Thanks in advance and good luck to all of you! 1) The dean called me from his cell at 7PM (6PM his time) on a Thursday to give me the offer. Considering the SC had only met 2 hours before (they gave me the schedule at my interview), I was 100% sure there was no way I was getting a call from anyone that soon. I would totally say it depends on the size of the school and the formality of the department.2) The Dept. Chair emailed me in the morning (10am) asking when would be a good time to call (at the interview he had mentioned he would call the candidate with the preliminary offer and then email the paperwork ~1week after all the candidates had interviewed). He called me that afternoon with the offer. The time frame (offer) was about 10 days after the last candidate had a campus interview (so pretty close) and two weeks to accept.(3) Call from the dean in the afternoon (2ish?) on the Tuesday after my interview (Thurs/Fri - I was the final candidate).  Initially got ~2 weeks to consider and came to a final decision after a few days of negotiating.  I got the call on my cell which was how I was initially contacted. (4) OP here, thanks so far. I keep hearing from others that it will likely take a few weeks even a month after the last candidate interviews but the last 3 posters have had a great turn-around time. (5) So far, fairly quick turn arounds (within a week of the last candidate interviewing), but the calls have mostly been at weird times.  I've been letting it go to voicemail so I can be composed, no matter what the news will be.  (6) I got an email from the SC 4-5 weeks after I interviewed indicating they wanted to offer me the position, and then we set up a time to discuss the position.
7) The department chair and the search chair (he was in the same room as the dept. chair) called me on my cell in the middle of the day in the middle of the week about 3 weeks after the last interview to give me my offer. I then received an email with the details and signatures. They're giving me 1.5 weeks to decide. (8) I got my offer via phone call from the dept chair 2 weeks after the last interview -- it was Friday afternoon -- perfect timing for leaving work early to get beers! (9) Got the call on a Wednesday morning.  Could not return phone call until next day - drove me crazy!

Good luck with your search!",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Startup 1) How many positions are people applying for? I'm up to about 15 and still going. 2) 22, and the ads for places I'm interested in have slowed down.

I keep finding more ads every week or two though, so I bet that will increase. 4) 40+... so far: wide net. 5) I've got 21 that will go out by Dec. 1; is it slowing down?

In regards to #6, I am not sure that ""qualifications"" per se are the biggest factor getting people jobs or interviews.  I think that certainly someone could have ""an in"" at 40 universities.  Developing such extensive professional networks would certainly come at the expense of what I'd consider ""qualifications"" (i.e., pubs, teaching, research, and mentoring experience).  But I'm not certain it's a less successful strategy.  In any case, if I was less selective I could have hit 40 by now.  Lots of SLACs, regionals, and CCs have broad target fields for applicants. 8) (person who wrote 6) Thanks for the response, I just feel like I haven't even read 40 job postings I fit this year, but I suppose I could be less narrow. This is my first time doing this so I'm curious to see other strategies. At my rate I think I'll hit 20 total. 9) This is (1) again, I think that I'll probably hit 20-25. I'm also regionally constrained, a big no-no, I get that, but it is what it is. Everyone is going to have a different strategy.  10)  I'm only up to 7 so far, but I'm already a tenured Associate Professor that's specifically looking for certain types of schools in certain states, so I'm being very picky.  I know that I've already not made 3 short lists, so not sure how successful I'll be at getting a new gig, but will keep trying to get some place in a location that I can actually tolerate.  I'm currently working in the first position that I could get following my last postdoc and I took the job, because I had no other options.  Not saying that I have a shitty job.  I'm at a well-respected M.S. level school in the southwest. I just don't like the location and miss having actual seasons.  Have managed to publish 1-5 papers/year in the last 7 years, am now totalling about a million in grant money, and have won teaching awards, so I think I'm competitive, but not sure what schools are thinking about my application, as it seems like I've made less short lists every year since I started looking for a new gig as an untenured assistant prof a few years ago.  :\  A friend of mine refers to having tenure as having golden handcuffs.  I don't know why.  Why do schools not want to hire folks that are already tenured?  It's like you're penalized for being successful elsewhere?  I don't get it. 11) I've applied to four jobs this year and made 3 short lists.  Seems like there aren't that many top 50 SLAC positions this year.  12) #11 are you tenured already?  13) I'm at about 45 so far.

Yet I've also been to interviews on campus where they film the chalk talk (sometimes without asking or without any advance notice). What is normal? 2) I see no problem with filming chalk talks. It's really important for people who may not have been able to attend.

NA,"Start-up before offer Are start-up costs factoring into the hiring decision? I read somewhere else here (1/29 Negotiations post) that interviewees were being asked to list their start-up needs pre-offer and I've been asked for a list of major equipment and cost when the other candidates haven't even interviewed yet. (1) I'm in the same boat.  This also happened to me last year (position was eventually cancelled after interviews but before a decision was reached). It seems to be part of the new rules of the game in this crazy job market.  I've talked to several faculty at my institution about it and they are unanimously appalled--in the  past, this kind of thing was considered borderline unethical.  But, it does not technically violate any rules, and since the market is like it is, we have to play the game as it's laid out for us.
2) Same thing for me at one school which I interviewed recently (I like to say that I interviewed them, hahaha). Total BS. They asked me for my start-up so that they would know what to offer me, if I was their choice.  Same as #1, the faculty that I've talked to think it's a load of crap. So I had to play ball I submitted my wish list and hope it doesn't count against me. Are there any folks here (SC's or job-seekers) with some insight on this? My wish list was modest but I keep thinking that the job will go to the ""cheaper"" candidate and that I should have low-balled them (myself). I'll also mention that I know of two other colleagues that were asked the same thing, before the interview.         
 (3) Last year, I was asked about startup costs after phone interview, and did not get invited to interview on site.
(4) I got asked for a startup estimate during a PHONE INTERVIEW.
5) @4, yikes, being asked over the phone sounds like a bad situation. Were you prepared with a figure and break down? How did they react? Did you get a campus interview? 
(6) not necessarily new, but maybe more frequent?  This happened to me a few years ago when I met with the Dean of a school and was asked to have one prepared ahead of time.  His jaw literally dropped when I showed him what I would need (it included a sequencer - they didn't have one and the position demanded it).  I was told that it didn't matter, but then again, I didn't get an offer.  I've also been asked for a start-up after interviewing and never heard anything from the school ever again (and that was a relief, actually).  Short strategy?  Ask for advice on top limit, stay within it, get the offer, negotiate after the offer if you have truly left something out that you need.  Everything is negotiable after the offer has been made.
(7) #4 here. I gracefully sidestepped the question (well, it would really depend on shared facilities, and I'm not yet prepared to say... blah blah blah). I should know very soon whether I get a campus interview...(8) I too got asked the same during a phone interview, and also just said I need what I need to get my lab up and running before I can get my first grant. They then proceeded to push for a number, and I said, we can talk numbers if it gets to that point. End of story, and probably no hopes for getting a campus interview... (8) i also got asked during a phone interview and then on an on campus interview the dept head asked me what equipment i needed.  for the phone interview i was totally taken off guard but it was for a small school so i think they wanted to week out those who need $200K to do their research or expect to do enough research to use that much; for the on campus interview i wasnt sure how to respond - several friends told me be as evasive as possible while others said its ok as long as they bring it up, not you.  but i am also concerned that my big ticket items (which i said are ""wish only"" and would be happy to write an equip grant in the future"" counted against me...
9) I was asked for a list before the interview too. At the interview with the department chair, the topic came up and he gave me a ballpark figure of the start up for incoming assistant profs. It was pretty good but my figure was about 60K over (most of the 60K was for a technician). I'm totally willing to shave off the extra 60K for a job. But, I think it's too late to change my figure (too shabby). After reading the above posts, I'm worried that I shot myself in the foot. Any suggestions? Advice?                      10) I was warned ahead of time they would be asking for an estimate in the phone interview.  I did the standard - depends on shared equipment, etc. But I did give them my high and low numbers, my high number turned out to be over twice what they could offer for startup.  I got invited for the on-campus interview anyway!   (11) I was asked ahead of time to come up with a ballpark startup estimate before the phone interview. During the interview, the SC appeared to want to know if I was above or below $100k.
(12) #4 and #7 again with an update - the school that asked me for an estimate during a phone interview just called and invited me for a campus interview, so that worked out ok. Interestingly, they actually told me what the expected salary and startup are when the called.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Success securing interviews #7 Again. I guess I like all of you piling on. So first things first. I said that I resmble that post. And what I mean by that is that I tend to find an excuse to not apply places. I.e. I didn't apply to Bard, NY City, not exactly right fit for job ad, etc. But it's not a good strategy. Second, I too used to think that since I had a spouse and kids, that I could somehow slack off, or that some how I was entitled to a job. Guess what, most of us that aren't getting jobs are losing out in searches to folks that don't have spouses/kids. At least that's been my experience. I've been on the market for 4 years, and I'm 40 (old), and my postdoc funding just ran out. So it's Sunday morning, and my kids are crying since I'm not home and my wife called me an asshole when I left for the office. But the reality is that even for the SLAC jobs that I've applied for (and even interviewed for) over the last 4 years, I've lost out to someone with more pubs than me. Sorry, it's true. So I've been cranking it out for the last year, and have had a 6+ paper year. It's fairly easy if you've post-doc'ed for a while to do that. It certainly won't be once I land that job, but I didn't say that. BTW, do a google search on some post-doc colleagues, you'll see a lot with double digit h-indexes. So, yes, because I want my kids off food stamps, and for me to stop sleeping on the couch, I'm fairly happy that there are a lot of you suckers out there that think that you get a pass for not cranking out tons of papers by search committees because you have a family, or are a swell person or whatever. This business that we are in is so stupid, and so ruthless, and it's half cult and half drug gang (look up the references, I've got apps due). But you and I can't change the rules, so we better start playing by them. And yes, finally, I would argue that if Bard really was a steaming pit, that someone with the chops like Kessing would have left a long time ago. The few rock star academics out there call their shots, and the rest of us take jobs in Alabama, or Albany, or in departments from hell. That's reality. So is the frequency of academic divorce, given how divorce is much less common among people with higer degrees. But, you know what else is reality? Having 8 or 10 pubs this last year means a few more interviews at SLACs, comprehensives, and any old school, than having less, hopefully....if my fucking letter writers actually write some letters. Now, where did I leave those meds? 12) Well put.  Good luck getting off the couch. 13) Congrats on the hard work #7, hopefully it pays off.  Your CV is probably strong enough to get you on a short list, but with all due respect, don't let you attitude kill your chances in the intervews.  Interviewers can smell resentment and shoulder-chips from a mile away.  And just as FYI for everyone, there are great SLAC jobs to be had for 2-3 pubs per year (or even fewer), if you also have everything else together (good teaching experience and philosophy, good letters, etc.).  Just because the person who beat you out had way more pubs than you doesn't mean that's WHY they beat you out. 14) Ok...I know I this about my expriences and thus anecdotal but I have had on-campus interviews for a number of SLACs and regionals. It is not always pub number that wins. For example, I interviewed at three places last year and had better pub records than two of the finalists. Papers are really important but at SLACs it is a slightly different mix. Also, one should be careful about where one publishes. A lot of papers in low tier journals with few to no papers in upper tier journal is sometimes looked at negatively. I am not making any direct points to the OP but just want to point out that number of papers is not the rule for getting jobs...it is a bit more complex than that and even more so at SLACs. 15) I looked up some folks getting jobs at top institutions (high level R1 stuff). Six plus pubs a year is a big deal. I am glad that the OP is getting a 6+ plus year and thinks this is fairly easy. I am sure you are on the short list for UT Austin, Dartmouth, etc. Kudos! Glad you went from thinking you could slack off to becoming a rock star...great job! OP) Not even close. Didn't apply for any of those, because I know I wasn't in the running. I'd have been happy with a call from any of the minor schools that I've applied for. And yes, if you are doing 100% research, you should be doing 5 or 6 papers a year, at least towards the end, including collaborations. I wasn't for the first few years of my post doc, lost out to people that were. And among my co-authors that are still post-docs, one put up 10 papers so far this year, another 4, and there is a great about to graduate student that I'm likely to compete with that put up six. Now, obviously not all are first authored papers, and some are more impactful than others. But I maintain my point that if you think that 1 paper in Oikos or Plos One per year is enough, then hat's off to you. I know from my own experience that this is not true. 16) nobody said one paper a year is enough. But you are pretty arrogant if you think 6+ a year is easy even after being a postdoc a few years. You are also wrong that this is what is needed to get positons at decent school. Look up any major SLAC (I did quickly look up folks at Swarthmore for example) and found that none had a 6 plus paper year. What you are saying is simply not true. I am not buying that you are publishing 6+ papers this year and really just hoping for a call back from a minor school. Two to three a year in decent journals will get you a job at a good SLAC and 3-4 will get you on a lot of R1 shortlists. 7) There is probably a bit of hyperbole on both sides. Correct, 1 paper a year isn't what you all are saying, just like I didn't say 6+ is easy. Didn't say easy, I said ""post-docs"" on 100% research loads that have been post-docing for 4 or more years should probably aim for 5-6 papers in their coming out year. Like it or not, it's very competitive. I work in molecular ecology, so perhaps among my comparables people publish more per year than more field-based ecological fields; as I review some friends' CVs, I think that might be right. I didn't apply for any of those R1s and I'm scared to. Perhaps it's imposter syndrome. And given that I haven't any meaningful teaching experience, maybe that is why I'm having poor luck at places like Swarthmore (though the woman that got that position last year is a very good fit, kudos to her). And frankly, consistent year over year 4 papers in very good journals (Ecology, Evolution, Mol Ecol), with 3 of the 4 as first authors, is probably harder than 6+ at a smattering of journals both good and bad and with only 50% as first authors. I certainly haven't been consistent, but I regret that I wasn't more disciplined earlier in my post-doc. Now I'm trying to get out papers that I've had the data analysed for 4-5 years. Could have done that earlier, when I was in denial. So, perhaps to get back to the original point of the post, imposter syndrome and talking oneself out of applying is real, even with one's back against the wall; don't talk yourself out of an application. 17 or 8 or whatever number) I'm a tenured Associate Professor at an M.S. level school.  I have three kids and don't use them as an excuse to be a slacker, asshole.  You do what you can when you have a family, a teaching responsibility, and a service responsibility.  NO one at my school, which is a good school, publishes 6 papers a year with the exception of mabye one or two individuals.  One has been around since the beginning of time and has a million collaborators that put his name on everything and the other publishs a dozen papers in shit ass journals like the Southwestern Entomologist every year.  I shoot for journals like Molecular Ecology, Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution, Journal of Comparitive Psychology, etc., as well as taxnomically oriented journals and regional journals and typically publish at least 2 papers a year, but sometimes as many as 4-6.  Folks in our positions do as much as we can given how much we have to do besides write and to say that we use kids as an excuse is bullshit.  ....but we do need to maintain a healthy home life and that does require more time devoted to family than to research on occasion.  Maybe your wife and others that have called you an asshole have figured out why you aren't getting jobs.  You're a delusional asshole.  We hired three new folks last year.  Again, I'm at a well-respected M.S.-level school.  Not a single one of them publishes 6 papers/year.  ...and they were all coming from postdoc positions.  Their research was interesting.  It fit what we were looking for and most importantly, when they came to interiview we liked them.  We liked their personalities.  If you come off as an asshole in your application, your phone interview, or an on-campus interview, you will turn folks off, as they will not want to have to deal with you on a regular basis.  Yes, you need to publish, but you also need to appeal to folks as a person.  Once you've made a short list, it's all a popularity contest.  Who's going to be the best person to work with as a person.  You, my friend, do not sound like someone I want to work with.  Get some anxiety meds or fuck your wife more, but get happier and nicer and stop working to publish 6 papers a year if you aren't even trying to get hired at an R1. You're killing yourself and being miserable in the process. 18) Note to self....fuck wife more. 19) It is really sad to see people get nasty like this on here. Come on guys, this is supposed to be a collaborative resource and supportive community for all of us. I'm tempted to just delete this whole thing so that no one else just reading through everything here has to see this. 20) Indeed, such hostility. ","^is it bad that I don't care if people ask me? 2) I don't care either. 3) <- are 1 & 2 men or women? 4) only in academia would one take offense to being asked this question. 5) https://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2013/10/28/illegal-questions-at-job-interviews/ 6) Wait, it's illegal to ask where else you're being interviewed? I've always answered openly and honestly... should I have been discreet?! 7) @6, it is neither illegal nor ""illegal"" to ask where else you're being interviewed (#5's link is right, even the obviously inappropriate questions are not technically illegal but could be construed as evidence of discrimination).  Back to OP's question, my academic spouse and I (M/F) don't care about such questions one bit.  Honestly, whoever would discriminate against a married woman would discriminate against an unmarried one too.  But our strategy to the two-body problem has been to sell ourselves as a package anyhow. 8) Exactly. I wouldn't want to be at a place where I had to hide my status anyway. Also, I don't have two-body prob and happy to report if asked. If I did I would sell as package as 7 says. Have to find right place for you, not just any place that will take you. 9) The fact that people who 'don't have two-body prob' or can 'sell ourselves as a package' don't mind answering these kinds of questions is exactly the reason that search committees are not supposed to ask the questions!! Not saying that there is anything wrong with either of your approaches, but both responses completely miss the point off these policies. ",NA,NA,"Specificity in job adds Why don't universities give more specifics about what the department in terms of research speciality? For example, if the department wants a Plant Phylogeneticist then why advertise for a General Ecologist? Why advertise for something general when the department is really looking for someone who studies nematodes in acidic soils in Bariloche in Argentina in the winter? These universities are wasting everyone's time including their own search committee's time. And don't give me the 'we want the best pool of candidates' line. Every job posting from Portland to Poughkeepsie is going to get > 100 applicants whether the job description is specific or general so I am sure you will have your 5-10 interview list even if you are more specific in the job add.; 2) Departments do not always agree on what they want and/or agree that it would be nice to have one of say 3 preferred types and they will select the best person no matter which of those types the person represents. I would rather join a department interested in having the best scientists in general than the best scientist studying nemotodes in Argentina. 3) I think OP is making the point that they sometimes have in mind a particular type they are looking for but don't say it. This is sometimes evident when a broad search produces three candidates who all just happen to study the exact same field. It isn't always true - sometimes the SC can't agree amongst themselves, and that's fair enough. But I agree that if you really want X, just say it in the job ad. 4) I can contribute a couple of thoughts. First, I think this tends to happen a posteriori, rather than a priori. The department as a whole (& the administration) agrees that the university needs a terrestrial ecologist, but then the search committee (sometimes after meeting and reviewing applicants) happens to be dominated by one or a few individuals who have a much more specific vision for the position. Second, the job ad needs to be approved by the administration. Thus, even if the department had a very specific need (say molecular ecologist), the college Dean or Provost might demand different or less specific wording, perhaps with their own agenda in mind, or perhaps merely because they don't understand the field. Finally, many search committees, though perhaps interested in particular in a specific area, do nonetheless have the genuine intent to consider applications from a broader area of study. (For instance, they may be looking for a terrestrial evolutionary ecologist, but willing to consider superstar evolutionary biologists working in any subdiscipline.) 5) Exactly! 6) I've heard of schools having crafted standard approved language for departments or groups within depts. They know what they want, but are forced to use an ad with little room for customization. 7) +1 to what #4 and #6 say 8) Agree with #3, 4&6.  In general, ""departments"" and ""universities"" don't want things – individual faculty members do.  And believe me, individual faculty members rarely agree on anything, certainly not what area to search in or which person to hire.  Also, not every search is overrun with applicants.  The last one in my R1 department got 30, largely because we had a fairly tightly focused job description. 9) #4 here. Yes, I agree with #8 in that the range of applicants is quite broad - broader than I realized when I was applying for jobs as a postdoc. I have served on SCs in which we have received 60-200 at an R2. I imagine the range across universities is even wider.","We need more updates!!! 2) LOL 3) Any updates on more updates? 4) holiday season, members of the SC are just too busy selecting costumes and gifts 5) You know what would be a great gift? A job offer. 6) Any updates on SC costumes?  7) I didn't realize asking for ""any updates"" offended and annoyed so many people... 8) Now I am scare to ask, when I get info I pass it on. 9) Don't be scared to ask for updates. We're all curious. Asking is neither offensive nor annoying in itself, but it is annoying when one asks for updates within, say, a week or two of the closing date. It takes time for committees to go through a (few) hundred apps, and then to find a time to meet and make cuts. Keep asking, but wait at least two or three weeks. 10) I predict there will be a onslaught of updates by the end of next week, right before Thanksgiving. 11) It was only annoying when someone wrote 'any updates' on every post ~ updategate 12) I should've gone as a SC chair for Hween - maybe as a literal dick with a mirror in front of me?!","how to bring up non-academic ties to a location Just wondering about peoples' strategies for when and how to mention personal ties (i.e.., family) to a particular town or city of a job you're applying for. Should this be mentioned in the cover letter? Does it ever help? 2) I am not sure but I would bring it up on-campus eventually. It looks to me like a desperate move, and not a real interest to the University but only the geographic location. But a SC committee member would provide a better advice. 3) sometimes I have a line in my cover letter about ""as a native of location x, I'd be particularly excited to set up local field projects in the ecosystems that inspired me to become an ecologist"" - maybe a little cheesy though? 4) Seems like it might help if the school is in a more out-of-the-way or undesireable location.  5)  I always mention my reason for applying to a school in my cover letter and that often includes the location or my history with an area.  I think it's actually a good thing to mention, as many places are afraid you'll come and go or use them as a stepping stone, so you want to make them feel comfortable in assuming you'll be coming and staying  6) Usually there's no point in mentioning this, but occasionally it could matter. Mentioning this is about explaining underlying motivation.  Why does the applicant actually want the job? If it's not clear from the application, I discard the application. So if you're faculty at a peer institution and you don't mention why you want to make a lateral move, I assume this is about leverage at home institution rather than genuine interest in our job.  But if local ties is your reason for wanting to move, then say so.   6) It's useful if you're a high-quality candidate applying to a lesser institution.  It helps give them a little bit of reassurance that you're not going to take off for a better opportunity after a few years.7) I've been working on this for several years now and haven't come up with anything. Can't say if it really helps or works, it's not going to be a big factor in their decisions, in my opinion. 8) relevant comment thread: https://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2017/09/24/how-much-should-you-customize-your-faculty-job-application-for-each-position/#comment-62026",NA,Research Statement Length Poll I'm just curious based on the below question--how long is everyone's research statment: 1) 1 page (x1) 2) 2 page (x31) 3) 3 page (x38) 4) 4 page (x11) 5) 5 page (x2)  6) Different versions depending on the job search (x2) ,NA,"Contingent campus interview? I was invited for a campus interview last week but the SC asked me for a second phone call. Well, the phone call was an ""update"" to let me know that out of the 4 candidates doing campus interviews only 2 of them had PostDoc Research experience (not me) and since that was one of the preferred quals those two candidates were interviewing first. If the SC decides on one of those two they'll offer and my campus interview will be automatically cancelled. Is this ""normal""? I appreciate the heads up but feels weird being told up front that I'm nothing but a plan B. 2) I've been ""reserve-listed"". IMO it's better than getting your hopes up, but it gives you an idea of where you are in the ranking. 3) That's weird, most of the time I don't think the search committee will tell you this. They must have budget issues or something. But good luck! And maybe it's nice to know the details! 4) That's some weird stuff. 5) Wow I've never heard of that! I mean, I think that kind of pre-interview ranking isn't super uncommon, but I've never heard of telling the candidates that ahead of time and actually making the whole interview contingent! Good luck!   6) Not normal at all.  It probably means people on the committee really liked you then someone threw a hissy fit about people not having pdoc experience.  If you just graduated and are in your postdoc now the chances are better than if you are still at your PhD institution.  It means they could make an offer contingent on finishing your postdoc.  Be prepared to suggest that as a way to get past a sticking point.  I hope you get the in person interview.  If you don't, apply to the same school next year if you still think it's a good job.   You likely have fans there, and your chances will be better at every job when you have postdoc experience.  Preferably a first paper from your postdoc. 7) Never heard of this. Suppose it is nice to know, but it sounds like bureaucratic bs. I got torpedoed by a disgruntled SC member once for similar reasons (the search failed that year). Just hire the best person SC! I wonder if there are any data showing postdoc experience correlates to job performance... 8) Postdoc experience correlates with... experience. 8). I just got an email from a place where I felt that I had a great phone interview but I already knew I hadn't gotten an on-site. The email essentially said that my application was still active and that the email was not a rejection. Maybe there is a movement in some committees to be more transparent about the process?"
NA,Portland State To those who interviewed (I was one): does anyone know the timeline for their decision process? The last interview was a few weeks ago. The candidates are now posted on their seminar page. Stiff competition! Good luck to everyone! 1) I heard they have made a decision and sent it upstairs for approval. Maybe contacting the successful applicant this week (Feb 8)?,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Tailoring cover letters 1) Has anyone heard anything about this position? 2) Negative. I did, however, speak to someone who used to work in this department. This individual expressed unrealistic expectations by the department.  3)  I had previously mentioned the red flags I saw with this gig, but someone dismissed me pretty quickly.  Not sure where those comments went, but just look at the chair.  She's published around 70 papers in the last 12 years (that's an average of almost 6 papers per year) and is the only full professor in the department.  After that, there is one associate and a few assistants.  This place can't hold on to people either because they don't get tenure or they leave because they are unhappy.  There is something very wrong with this place. 4)It seems like this is a small teaching college. How much research do they expect? 4) There's a very interesting New Yorker article published in the last few weeks about Bard's president.  It reveals some scary information regarding financial stability and faculty support. 5)  Here's a quote from that article regarding the President of Bard ""A consistent criticism of Botstein is that he runs Bard like a duchy, that professors’ opinions are routinely disregarded and their expertise ignored. On a number of occasions, he has overridden hiring and tenure decisions made by otherwise supportive departments. Botstein refuses to speak with restraint, even when it’s in his best interest, and his temper was described to me as “Biblical” by an employee who went on to recall, albeit fondly, an outburst that was “a blitzkrieg of torrent, metaphors, congratulation, deceit, and stories that didn’t make any fucking sense at all.”""  Good luck if you end up at this place! 6) Letters requested October 13th. 7) HA, HA, HA. I resemble this post. Get the job offer, and then figure out why being tenure track here is worse than whatever shitty post-doc or adjunct position you have.  Seriously. And I'm personally thrilled that 6 papers a year sounds like a lot to many folks.  7 again) Glad that I checked out who that department head is, she's a rock star in disease ecology that has published some of the most important papers defining how we now understand the relationship between biodiversity and emerging zoonotic disease. I didn't realize that she was at Bard, that's a shining example to us all of how productive we all can be at a SLAC. BTW, I'm sure she's been offered her fill of R1 positions, and SHE hasn't left, so just maybe Bard isn't hell on Earth (just sayin'). 8) Holy shit, #7, I think (?) I agree with your main point, but I'm pretty sure that you need to go back on your meds. 9)  I agree with #8.  Meds... Back on them...  10)  Slept on what 7 said and have come to conclusion that you're kinda an arrogant asshole.  If 6 of your 7+ pubs/year are Herpetological Review Natural History Notes, they don't really count.  You also, obviously, don't have a wife/husband or children or a job at a 4-year school or Master's level school where you have to balance teaching, service, and scholarship.  If you do have a family and either full-time job that I mentioned, then you must have caffeine coursing through your blood and I bow down before you, but you are delusional if you think the normal mortal can get 7 respectful pubs out every year while working at a 4-year school.  ....unless, of course, you are 7th author out of 15 authors.  Kudos to the biology chair at Bard for being so awesome, but I bet she goes home to a house full of cats every night. 11) An average of 6 papers a year is a lot....if it is in respectable journals. I just looked up some big names at R1 places and 6 on average is the high end and these are usually established profs running their own labs with postdocs etc. So yes - 6 papers a year is a lot. No idea if Bard is a good place to work or not. 12) having lots of pub/year for sure helps, but you may invest some of your time in gathering teaching experience, do outreach, network in your field, and maybe most importantly, demonstrate that you have your own research agenda and that you are able to secure extramural funding.  13) The number of papers you publish per year is dependent on your field.  Herpetologists and entomologists tend to publish more papers per year.  IT is the nature of their discipline.  You can survive without HR notes, you cannot survive without meaty studies that are deep.  However, when I was interviewed for a job at the veterinary college, I was quickly shut up by the full professor when I kind of downplayed my handful of HR notes at the time.  He told me, what HR notes tell me is that you finish what you started, no matter where it ends up.  I think that is how we should look at these things.  Done is better than perfect. ","It doesn't take much to write a short, polite rejection letter to candidates. If you're a member of a search committee and you don't do this, you are, as a person, an asshole. There are no excuses for failing to do this. 2) Did you get a rude rejection letter? 3) More likely no letter at all 4) You can't expect this anymore - too many candidates - and searches can bounce back to you after they fail at some level. In addition, typically after they offer someone the job, it is a long time before they are locked down - at that point the search may be out of the hands of the committee. I agree it sucks, but it is the norm. OP) I've never had a rude rejection letter - often none. The frequency with which this occurs is irrelevant to whether or not the SC is an asshole, though. 3) again, I agree with OP. You're tellling me that with all the assets and innovations available to universities that they can't dash off a quick note?! I'm not expecting letterpress staionary or anything. OP) agree this is standard behavoir, indeed my expectation. I actually posted this after receiving a polite rejection, and I thought: this was nice and took almost no effort. Why don't some people make the effort? 4) Don't damn the whole search committee, only the SC chair has this authority. 5) They do not this because there are zero consequences for bad or inconsiderate actions. If next year the same job is up again, you and me and 200 other people are still applying. 6) They must have forgotten how hard (or how easy) it was when they were applying for a job...  7) I got an asshole rejection once, and borderline a handful of times. I'd prefer no letter at all. 8) I've gotten two letters from Missouri. Of course I don't even care about that job. Thanks, Missouri.  9) #8 if you don't care, why did you apply? 10) because ones I care about never call back. Perhaps I should say that it is a job I am not excited about.  10) I've got nada from Missouri.... no interviews, no rejection.  Maybe you got my copy??? 11) They keep reminding me I'm not in the top 20% of evolutionary biologists that applied. To Missouri. 12) If you look at the seminar list, the candidates are pretty good. 13) I'm sure. So many good candidates out there. 12) Missouri gets an A for promoting diversity. So you might be in the top 20% of Evol Biol., but a bit too wonder bread. 13) No. 14) Yeah, Missouri looks wonderful http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/10/us/missouri-senate-approves-bill-protecting-opponents-of-same-sex-marriage.html?smid=fb-nytimes&smtyp=cur",NA,NA,"Letters requested If a university requests letters of reference after an application has been submitted, do they typically inform the candidates as well? Or just the letter writers?  2) No they don't tell the applicant (typically). Usually one of the letter writers passes the good news to the applicant. x2 3) My experiences are opposite. I received emails from places that require letters, e.g. UTK. 4) I've seen both but in most cases they have contacted me (the applicant) and either asked me to contact my references or just let me know that they are contacting references now. I think I have only had one or two cases where they contacted references without telling me and 8-10 where they let me know first. 5) I agree with 4 that you see both but my experience has been that more often they contact the references and not me - and sometimes committees seem to contact references when you make the long list for a phone/skype interview ","Some positions seem to fit me perfectly and I am not even asked for the reference letters; for others, I even forget I apply for, and am sure I won't be consired at all, and I am asked for an interview. The way the SC thinks is very obscure to me. 2) The randomness of it is frustrating. The things we are trained to think are important, like research productivity, are often not so important in the eyes of SC 3) devil's advocate here--but HR and higher-ups often have to modify job ads, so the ads aren't always what a committee wants, and the committee itself is full of people with varying desires and perspectives. It's life, I don't know why this bothers so many people. And if a SC requested one thing, and got a variation on that from someone who would be a great fit for the department, of course they'll go with them. I would if I was them","Faculty support overruled by Administration I have a complicated situation that I'm interesting in hearing some outside perspective on. Last job cycle, I was a Visiting Assistant Prof and an internal candidate for a position, and I interviewed for the position and despite positive feedback from my colleagues, extremely positive teaching evals, research productivity, and service to the university, I was not offered the position. I later learned (through this Wiki) that another candidate received the offer, and that candidate declined, and the search failed. Prior to my departure, multiple faculty in the Department told me that I was the top choice of the search committee and of the departmental faculty, but the administration overruled their decision and offered the position to #2. When #2 turned down the offer, the administration failed the search (it's being re-run this year). I have since moved on to a new position, but no reason was ever provided as to why I was not offered the position by the administration. For what it's worth, I am openly gay and this was in a conservative area. Can anyone give me any insight on if there is any plausible case of discrimination here? This institution is subject to state law barring discrimination for sexual orientation; however, I don't know how to even begin gathering evidence that this might have been the case. This has been on my mind for a long time now, and I'm finally coming around to exploring the possibility of some potential wrongdoing here. Any constructive comments or insights are welcome. 2) Sorry to hear about your situation! This strikes me as a case in which, even if they are in the wrong, you are unlikely to achieve an outcome that actually rectifies the situation. If you have a friendly contact on the faculty, you might first ask for more information from them. I'm not a lawyer, but I believe verbal is hearsay; anything you can get in writing will make for much stronger evidence. I think what you would need is evidence, in writing, that being gay was the reason you were not offered, rather than some other reason having to do with ""fit"" to the position.   If you are at a public institution, the records from the previous search may be obtainable with a FOIA (as they are at my university).  Elsewhere on this page is a discussion fo FOIA vs a previous search. 3) OP here - thanks for insight! It was a public institution, and I do have it in writing that I was the top choice. However, that's all I have. I just filed an inquiry with the EEOC and will speak to an investigator tomorrow! 4) I feel like maybe I'm missing something here. Do you actually have ANY reason at all to suspect their decision had anything at all to do with your sexual orientation? Reminds me of the hypothesis that since Hitler had a mustache, it must of had something to do with the atrocoties he committed. 5) @4, except that there is no long running history of discrimination against people with mustaches and Hitler wasn't passed over as fuhrer in a very unusual way. We have prior information about the state of the world and the likelihood of different possibilities, you don't seem to understand that. OP, sorry about your experience! It does seem unlikely that you could prove anything, but good luck getting some resolution. 6) Wow, first, you have gotten some bad advice here. Second, federal law is unfortunately very weak on employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation (CRAZY, RIGHT?). However, a minority of states have statutes preventing employment discrimination based on orientaton. These people are wrong that you would likely get ‘no resolution.’ A failed search is a actually a great measure of bias and the good evidence you have  here is not cofirmation of you being a top candidate, but the documentation of your work (evals, productivity...etc). The first step would be to see if your school is in a state that has law protecting you from discrimination (https://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:LGBT_employment_discrimination_law_in_the_United_States.svg#mw-jump-to-license). Step two is to find a lawyer local to the school that deals student and staff litigation and mediation regularly, there is at least one in town for every school, 4 or 5 for larger schools. The really sad thng is that the ability to bring action against this school wouldn’t even be a question if you thought you were being discriminated against because of gender, race, or ability. But since it is an orientation bias, you must rely on the hodgepodge mix of state laws. I am very sorry that this happened to you, just know that we all know you deserve better 7) I suppose few of us here are lawyers, so I think you'd be best off consulting one.  Good luck! 8) Knowing people at the EEOC, they will take your case seriously and act with expertise in spite of whatever BS flies around at the top levels of the current administration. You didn't deserve that. Best wishes for a good resolution for you. (x1) 9) @6, what aspect of the advice here is bad?  The stated reason for the failed search is unknown. The fact that the search failed does NOT strike me as prima facie evidence of bias, searches fail for all kinds of arbitrary reasons (end of fiscal year, new dean, etc etc) having nothing to do with bias against a particular candidate.  The issue here is not was there bias, the issue is whether there is solid evidence of bias that the OP can find. 10) there was another offer, friend. arbitrary reasons dont make sense 11) I'm sympathetic with OP and hope the best for them. Some public schools have obsessive hr depts. that will basically veto any in-house hire because the school has gotten in touble in the past for in-house hires...even if no favoritism was extended in the current situation 12) I was a VAP at the same place I received my PhD. A job came up that suited me, the descriptions was written to my strengths and history (current classes being taught and my specific research area), all the faculty wanted to hire me, and I had a substantial grant that would fund grad students, but the President of the University would not allow the department to interview me, even after the Department chair met with the President to explain why they wanted to interview me. I was the inside candidate but the administration would not allow an in-house hire. I'm not saying there wasn't shady things going on in the OP situation, I am just saying inside candidates don't always get their fair shot. 13) OP here. Interesting note to #12 and I def have sympathy with you; however, in the same job cycle as my interview and in years prior, there were internal VAPs from other departments (in the same College as me, even!) that got hired for TT slots. So I don't think that point holds water in this circumstance. In any event, thanks for all the perspectives everyone - very helpful! 14) @13,OP the fact that other VAPs from other departments got hired on for TT positons is very important information when you are looking for possible reasons why you were passed over. Knowing this, then of course it rules out the strong possiblity of you being overlooked because of an internal hire. If you are going to pursue this make sure you bring that up at the initial stages of discussion.",NA,"Faculty Jobs sheet not updating I've noticed for the past few weeks that sometimes when I add information on the Faculty Jobs tab -- for example, incrementing the Number Applied column when I apply, or adding a comment in the Discussion column -- the Latest Update field does not update to the current date.

AP",NA,"When will you be reviewing applications? Question for SC members perusing here: Many application deadlines were the 15th of this month. Given the holiday season and end of semester are upon us, are you likely to review applications prior to the start of the new year? Thanks for your insight. 2) Good question. So, when I chair a search committee, I try to make everything fair for everyone. I know people go home for the holidays, so if I don't think I can get everyone booked for a phone interview or campus interview before a holiday, I try to book everyone after. If your deadline was the 15th, I don't think it would be outrageous for you to hear back before the winter academic break to schedule a phone interview after the break. Granted, I have had phone interviews over the winter academic break at other universtities. It's really going to be dependent on the university. Oh, and some more info. At my university, we are usually dealing with around 70 applicants. When I chair a committee, my goal is to have phone interviewees decided within 2 to 3 weeks. Then we have to get approval from HR to contact our top candidates, which can take another week or two. OP) Thank you very much for the info! That is very helpful. 2 again) I'd also like to say that the time it takes to get the list down to the phone interviewees is purely committee-dependent. When I'm with a group of fast working committee members, we can have that list trimmed down within a week or slightly over a week. There are so many variables involved...   3) My SC had a difficult time getting everyone in the same place with holidays.  We are trying to get phone/Skype interviews before the holidays, with in-person interviews starting in Jan.  It wasn't easy though to get everyone into the same room.  I wouldn't fret too much over searches that don't have the Skype list before the winter break. It's likely just a scheduling issue. 4) Thank you so much for these answers! I've had a couple applications in on the 1st and 15th and have been going a bit crazy because I've heard nothing back. It's nice to know this isn't 100% fatal.  5) faculty here- we can't find a time for all faculty to meet until January... so we won't even get to our short list until that meeting (deadline was the 15th)"
NA,"Advice While applying for tenure track positions (not successfully) I have taken on an adjunct teaching position to remain in academics at some level and have money for food (top ramen).  As an adjunct, research seems impossible.  Does anyone have any suggestions on how to remain active with research while teaching as an adjunct out of desperation?  I can foresee my research based tenure track career evaporating. 1) Get a postdoc position.

2) Is it possible to form a collaboration with someone at a nearby institution?  Perhaps even contributing to their research lab in a modest amount, in exchange for being inserted anywhere they see fit in the author line, could be a feasible alternative in the short-term?  Another possibility is to mine the literature like crazy and start working on a theoretical paper in lieu of field work (or lab work)?    3) I'd add to #2 to say if theory isn't your area find a topic for a review paper - these can be very high impact too which can at least partially compensate for not producing a lot of papers and good luck!
4) #1 here again.  Let me expand on my previous terse comment in case you think I was being flippant.  Presumably you want a tenure-track position at an institution that values research (R1, R2).  If so, then you need to focus solely on your research.  Adjuncting is not going to advance your career in the direction it needs to move.  In case you didn't notice, the competition is rough out there, and people are judged by their rate not cumulative number of pubs.  An extra review or theory paper is not going to push you over the top at an R1/R2 school when it comes at the cost of an extra year since PhD.  If you're serious about research, get into a position where that's what you can do 40-60 hours per week: a postdoc.

Also, I'm sure you're aware of this (so I say it just to emphasize the point), but the length is secondary to the structure of a CV, teaching statement, etc. - particularly so when comparing SLACs vs. R1s. 3) For R1s I think 2 for research, 1 for teaching, 1 for letter...most of the time. 4) I would say that it depends to some extent on your current position; for example, i'm currently an assistant professor a few years into my curret position so my CL is 2 pages now, but was 1 page when I initially applied for jobs (there's just a little bit more to highlight now). As someone who's served on a search committee, I think that people really stop reading teaching and resarch statements after 2 pages.

So, I rather suppress my creativity with some boring stability than anxious uncertainty. x4  5) It's not just the feeling like I'm wasting time on applications that will not result in an interview, I feel paralyzed by the uncertainty.

If yours isn't on there, you can probably at least find similar institutions. It's a pdf that's fairly easy to google.  5) Your best bet is to talk to the last junior hires in the same University system.

When applying for lecturer (nonTT teaching) positions, do you mention that you would be happy to do research, too?  I have a short paragraph about my research, just in case they are interested.  But does that make it sound like I expect to be able to do research while there? 2) It is good to strike the balance of having research plans and ambitions but not looking like you don't realize that teaching like take up most of your time. 3) Very important not to give the impression that you don't really want a 100% teaching job, or that you have any expectations of being able to do any research. Now, if the hiring institution is looking for someone who can supervise undergrad independent study projects or something, by all means say you can do that. And if you have the desire and ability to do pedagogical research, maybe that's something the hiring institution might consider a plus? But just speaking from my own experience, it's very unlikely that the hiring institution has any interest in your ecological research. They're going to be wary of hiring anyone who'd really rather be doing ecological research.  4) I have heard some people say they really like to see how you might mentor undergrad research.   ",NA,"Search committee keeping my application active in case search fails. Is that common?   1) Yes...it means that your application may be revisited if the first round of interviewees is not suitable or all the top candidates take other offers. I've seen many searches go back into the pool after phone interviews and/or campus interviews. Your chances are slim, but there is still a small shred of hope. 2) This happened to me last year, a school interviewed three, made an offer to one and didn't like the other two. Their top choice refused the offer so they went back to the pool and interviewed me. It happens. 3) #2 is right, it does happen...but it is pretty rare. It's pretty common where I am because we always make offers to people who can get better deals elsewhere. 4) Any advice for someone who is in this situation and would strongly prefer the school that has them on the back burner but also has other interviews moving forward?  5) @4 you could reply to whoever sent you the update with just that info (you've got other interviews going on but you prefer them).  A long shot, but couldn't hurt. 6) Agree, I think being honest that you really want a position but have other offers is a nice thing. A very nice thing indeed. 7) Totally agree with 5&6, and kudos to you 4! Tip for interviewees: communicate with your SC about these kinds of things and be candid.

NA,"Boise State So, just to clarify the comment about the Boise jobs below (1/14): letters have been requested for the ecosystem ecologist position? If so, around what date were they requested? 1) I know the person who had their letters called from Boise State could not be considered a zoologist under any circumstances, so yes, I think it was for ecosystem ecologist position. (2) Thanks! (3) the job posting for the zoologist on the BSU website says that interviews should take place in Feb-early March. (4) I just got a rejection letter for the Ecologist position (2/17/2010).

It's all about their need to get the best person into the position.  Not hearing may mean that you are down the list, but they think someone is better.

",NA,NA,"""Reviews starting"" or ""Application Due by""  Okay, so this is kind of a silly/neurotic thing - I've had several applications that I thought I could turn in on, say, Nov 1st, only to rediscover that the posting says that the review of applications will begin on Nov 1st. So, if I turn in an application any time on Nov 1st, do I get tossed in to the shredder? Is the dinstinction between review starts and due date a real one? Yes, I  know in a perfect world I should turn in my application before this becomes a quesiton, but life.  2) One job had a secretary in charge who said all apps not in her inbox with all letters delivered by the deadline would not be fwd'd to the search chair.  That situation is pretty rare, but in this business, I don't like to take chances. 3) I've never seen a search committee start work on the day ""review of applications will begin"".  Don't sweat it. 4) The listed date is the 'deadline' (not one day before), and in 95% of cases applications will be accepted after the deadline - particular if the search committee has not yet begun meeting. I agree with #3 - don't sweat it! 5) In our search last year the files were available to us before the end of the closing date, and the SC chair divvied up the list before the end of the day.... and only later noticed that there were more applications that appeared later!  Would have been easy to miss them 6) #4 here again. Yes, I have seen what #5 has reported. Also, if the applications are submitted to an email address (e.g., the departmental secretary), in the past sometimes so many applications came in on the last day that the account filled! (This is less common now that email quotas tend to be larger, and that more institutions are using web-based submission systems.) 7) I've had the same question - sometimes it's a due date, sometimes the date on which review begins - it's confusing. I appreciate the insight here. 8) Honestly, unless you really think you're going to add something to your CV, get them in a week or even two early. This means that you don't sweat the deadline and the committee might become more familiar with seeing your name. 9) Just to reinforce what #8 says - I know of universities where HR will not allow applications received past the deadline to be passed on to the search committee and this can happen even if that first deadline is just the first review date. In some cases, your letters also must be received to consider your application ""complete"" and be passed on to the committee. ","Dropped my phone in the toilet so now I can't get phone calls from places. Great. That will teach me to remove it from my back pocket.

There is still plenty of hope they'll never actually contact you at all!"" 3) Actual footage of OP: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cY-7vOEC7Bc>","grants Hopefully this can start an interesting discussion: I just learned my PI's group got a huge NIH grant, on which I am senior personnel (couldn't be PI due to rules about postdocs), I wrote an Aim, and will receive support from the grant. I would like to ask the group (a) how best to spin this in interviews/cover letters, and (b) should I call up SCs that have shortlisted and already interviewed me to let them know, and (c) how much credit should I take? This research is largely my intellectual contribution to my current lab, and it constitutes much of my research plans for job apps. I have a good relationship with my current PI.  2) Your advisor should ads this to her/his rec letter.  If you even get a phone interview try to work in that you have at least some experience co-writing grants.  You probably could work in 1 cover letter sentence mentioning the experience, but a lot of people won't emphasize that too much until you get to the more serious interview stage.  3) I completely agree with 2: much more powerful to have your advisor discuss it (you can say something like ""I contributed an Aim to the recently funded NIH grant that currently supports me""). 4) Definitely mention in cover letter, including your contribution. Also list in CV. 5) I had a similar situation during my PhD. Although the grant was not nearly as high profile as NIH it did fund part of my dissertation research and 1.5 yrs of my salary. I worked with the funding agency to develop the goals and objectives, wrote the grant, and did the modeling work. My advisor was involved with the administrative duties and edited my writing but I did the majority of the work. Because of the University rules I could not be PI or even co-PI so officially my name was not on the grant at all. My advisor was the sole PI on the grant and told me to list it on my CV as co-PI and he would discuss it on any letters they wrote to make sure I got credit for it. I think if your advisor is supportive of it, I would definately consider yourself co-PI. 6) While can consider yourself co-PI, don't claim this on your CV unless it's literally true.  Exaggeration on CVs is a major faux pas in my eyes.  7) #5 here, I should clarify something. My name was on the proposal, progress report, final report, and all manuscripts as first author because I wrote all of them. I also had full control of the budget at the University which was recognized by contracts and grants and the department. I was the Universities main contact for everything about the grant. The only thing that did not have my name on it was contracts and grants formal budget sheet. Because of this, I think it's more than just considering myself as co-PI, I was co-PI. 8) @ 5/7 I think your situation is not uncommon (I'm in a similar spot as a postdoc right now), but if someone were to go look up your grant in a database, would they see your name listed as a 'co-PI'? It sounds like they would not. Maybe your grant can't be looked up like that, but for things like NSF & NIH that information is easily accessible to anyone. No matter how much you are a true PI in 'all but name' I think it is risky to list that status when someone could misinterpret things by looking it up themselves. Having the mentor address it directly in a letter does seem like the best option. 9) I co-wrote an NSF proposal that was funded - involved from the beginning, but couldn't be considered a PI due to postdoc status. I was listed on the proposal as ""senior personnel"" as the postdoc on the project, and I list it on my CV with my role as ""co-author and senior presonnel."" My name would not come up in the database, and I agree that despite my de facto co-PI status, I would not list it as such. Just list your role truthfully - I like co-author, and your advisor supporting this in the rec letter would be helpful. OP) awesome, i was thinking along those lines and nice to see that it's considered best practice. Thanks! ",NA,"Post doc offer - moving costs? I received a post doc offer at a great university (grant-funded).  The offer letter did not include support for moving costs.  Would it be appropriate to ask for some?  I presume that many newly-minted PhD's are unable to afford a cross-country move (and all of the necessary deposits, though I understand that cannot be helped).  2) I asked for and received some support for moving costs with a postdoc that was funded via my advisor's startup money. It's worth asking. 3) It is always worth asking. It is a job. Ask for a higher salary, moving expenses, computer funds, and anything else important to you. 4) I know someone who had a new postdoc advisor start paying them a month early because they couldn't logistically offer moving costs. lots of people will be supportive of this request or creative in how they can help you make it happen  4) Sometimes PIs run into red tape where they aren't allowed to do this.  Often the solution is to increase salary above scale to accomodate.  If they offer that solution, take it. 5) Doesn't hurt to ask. I got 1500 in moving costs. New tax rules might make moving costs taxable, as they used to be tax-free 6) You should ask. I moved across country 1.5 years ago and I'm still struggling to pay off the moving debt. My PI offered me 500 dlls which were great but I wish I would've asked for a bit more. 1)  Thanks guys!  I was told that the university does not allow PI's to directly offer a moving allowance, but he could start my position one pay period earlier than I arrive, so I wouldn't have to wait 3 weeks for my first pay check.  4) Victory!",NA,"Interview feedback? 1) Wondering if anyone has ever aksed the SC chair or faculty members for feedback on their interview? I'm thinking about this because I had a phone interview that I thought went well, but I know from posts on this board that I haven't been invited to interview on campus (thanks for posting!). I can imagine if I were to ask for feedback I would likely get a generic answer like 'we didn't think you would be a good fit'. I would like to improve my phone interviews (so far none have landed me on campus) but I'm not sure how to best identify what exactly I should focus on.2) See row 143 on the discussion tab of last year's wiki: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1z64-PTCydZIB_afaYXYUf4fVniFckHmGZwVgbeg4nNY/edit#gid=767220805 3) that discission on last year's wiki disappeared, there's a discussion on salaries instead AP) I rescued this from the depths of the history. 4) I have asked after in person interviews where I didn't get an offer, mostly you get platitudes about how great you are but there being another candidate with better fit. x2 I did once get truly helpful feedback when a search chair agreed to a phone call to talk about my interview and focused on things I could improve. I suspect this is rare (although I really appreciated it). 5) It's my understanding that one of the main reasons we rarely get feedback on applications (and this really goes for the entire job market in general) is that when a university/company says you were not hired for X reason or could improve your application in X way, they are potentially making themselves liable for discrimination based on whatever the specific reason was they didn't hire you. 6) I am not concerned about that, I just don't know how to help you. Ph.D.s are everwhere and all I need is to find one to be a colleage. If you make it to the interview stage you are more than qualified, you were just beat by someone who was more polished, or whom Dr. X liked because they want a drosophila person, or whom dean X liked because they want [insert gender/race] to be hired so we don't look sexist or racist. There is literally nothing to say to you except practice interviewing and your chalk talk, and you won't get hired if you are a weirdo. It is so ridiculous behind the scenes. The real reason you weren't chosen after an interview is either so miniscule or has nothing whatsoever to do with you. The only thing you can do is practice. x3 7) I wouldn't recommend this unless you have a specific suspicion (e.g. bad letter of ref, something went wrong on campus visit), in my experience they manufacture reasons after the fact to justify their choice which is so very rarely based on merit or quantifiable details. 8) Phone interviews are for the committee to see if their impressions of you based on the application packets are right. I am on a search comm this year after many years on the market and it is such a crapshoot, qualified people can be unsuccessful because they are not a good fit, too close to someone already there, or they just didn't give good answers to the mentoring and diversity questions. My best pieces of advice are to convey enthusiasm and energy over the phone (hard to do), and use all the time they give you to sell yourself, your research vision, and your interest in teaching/diversity. Another piece of advice that I used (successfully) is to find out who the search comm members are before the interview - just ask. Then when they ask you who you will colloborate with, mention the junior members of the committee (try to think of a legit connection with them). Committee members are trying to find a good colleague who can serve on their students' committees, share teaching, and even collaborate, and the junior folks are going to work with the eventual hire for a looong time. The rest of it is practice and blind luck. "
NA,"advice Just curious if there are any international applicants here on this wiki? I mean those who are not ""lucky"" enough to have found an American spouse and might thus need the hiring US institute's sponsorship for H1B's or green cards. If so, how would you go about bringing up this matter during the application process? Would you mention it during an interview? After an offer has been made? I know this could be a sensitive issue as many universities do not want to go through the trouble of dealing with USCIS. 1)I don't think you need to mention it until after the offer is made; however, my impression is that it is a relatively trivial consideration for most universities. 2) Don't mention it until you have an offer. Many universities have an office that will deal with all the CIS paperwork, the chair, dean, (and even less likely, the SC chair) won't have to deal with it, so they shouldn't care. (3) OP here. I speak from first-hand experience that it can be a pain in dealing with all the USCIS red tapes. I did a postdoc in the US, and my advisor was required by law to pay for the filing fee for the H1B, which costed him almost $2000 from the grant, not to mention all the bureaucracy involved. So I'm wondering if you save this question until the last after the offer, could it be perceived as being dishonest on your part by the SC? (3) it isn't dishonest if you aren't asked. It is dishonest to deny you have a spouse if asked. And by the way, most of those questions status of your spouse (what kind of work they do etc) are illegal, aren't they? Get the offer, then negotiate. The former is the hard part. (4) Again, the SC usually do not care, they're not the ones filling your H1B paperwork, or paying for it (e.g., see U. Minnesota's Scholar Services http://www.isss.umn.edu/H1BEmployment/default.html). If they want you, no one will blink at the $2k in filling fees. (5) some schools care. At least one with a search this year has a rep of bringing in foreign faculty and then refusing to do the H1B so you use up your time, they don't have to give you tenure, etc... (6) If they have a problem with paying for your H1B, you probably don't want to be there. Most universities won't blink at the H1B, my school has taken care of everything except the final adjustment of status for the Green Card ($1010 per family member). It has been a long, frustrating, and sometimes infuriating process, but thankfully it is nearly over. (7) Congratulations, #6. I just hope I could make the same statement one of these days.

I'm surprised UTA was one of the first openings I heard of this season, and now it's less than a month from when the first interview is scheduled to be and it seems like they might have not contacted many people yet? (At least based on the lack of news here). When I heard of the job opening, my supervisor thought they were trying to be quick to make a swift offer and get first pick without having to outbid other offers their top candidate would get, but yet here we are... Just curious if this is unusual or not! 2) If UT hasn’t inform their top candidates yet, for a first-tier university, it’s a bit unusual to give top candidates relatively short time to prepare the interview. In terms of the timeline, it is not unusual at all. In fact for other universities, most of the interview notices may only send out after mid-november or after thanksgiving. 3) It's surprising that the deadline was in August and candidates might not have even been invited. My guess is the integrative nature and coordinating accross departments? 4) I was wondering about that job too since it is definitely late given their deadline and stature (sorry #2, but I've applied to enough jobs and tracked on the wiki over the last 3-4 years to know that this is slow!). I wonder if they actually have already invited their candidates and just didn't happen to pick anyone who updates on the wiki. 5) Some searches are just plain slow.

What topics are brought up during the one-on-ones with search committee members? What about when you have the full search committee interview in person? Is it more about making sure that you're a decent human being to work with? Any tips/encouragement would be much appreciated! 2) My own experiences on both sides of the fence have varied widely, so it's impossible to prepare for every possible question. But you can certainly do your best to cover the basics. My favorite questions to ask interviewees in one-on-ones are questions about involving undergrads in research (e.g., tell me about a one-semester and a two or more semester project that you could involve a student in right now) and questions about how likely they are to be happy at our institution (teaching load, facilities, etc.) and living in our town (we are relatively isolated from anything remotely like a big city). I also ask questions about specific courses they'd like to teach. If you could develop and teach a course that is currently NOT offered at their institution, what would it be? How would it compliment courses they currently teach? And finally, read up on the institution's mission statement and history. Some institutions (especially SLAC and religious schools) really care a lot about those things, and they are likely to ask you questions about how your educational philosophy fits in. Good luck! 3) It's important to have prepared some questions YOU can ask THEM too. Almost everyone will ask you to ask questions and you want to make sure you're actually prepared with something that is beneficial to you! Collect lots of data on the things you care about most so that you can form some kind of concensus and see if the department (and admins) largely agree or if answer vary wildly. This kind of thing can be an especially valuable exercise. 4) <- this also shows that you're interested in the position! Seems silly to say, but I was on a SC and one of the candidates didn't really ask questions or seem overly interested during the campus interview. They might have gotten an offer if they had shown greater motivation and interest. 5) Yes, in addition to everything else stated, definitely have lots of questions at the ready. You need to demonstrate that you are enthuastic and actively gathering info. You should never say 'no"" when someone asks you if you have questions. Even if it's something that seems mundane, it's better to ask a question than to suggest you don't have any. Ask about facilities, admin support, internal funding, student interest in research, student diversity, what it's like to live in the town/city, etc. Pro tip: remember that there is nothing wrong with asking the same or similar questions of multiple people. Indeed, doing so can actually be a good idea because you are likely to get different answers from each person. 6) Re #5, asking multiple people the same question can be valuable to see how cohesive a department might be. I was given the advice to ask ""What do you see as the vision of the department for the next five years?"" It wasn't something I would have though to ask on my own, but proved to be really useful in seeing how well the faculty meshed on the direction they saw the department heading in, which is important for an early career faculty member. 7) OP here - thank you SO much for all the wonderful advice!! I think it went well - and I had several SC members say that I asked very thoughtful questions! Hooray! Thank you so much! 8) Congrats OP, and good luck!",NA,"How to contact search chair for status After I applied for a Visiting position at a SLAC, I found a job ad there for a TT position that I could also apply for, but whose deadline has passed (one of those ""review of applications begins Nov 25 and continue until the position is filled"").

(I have seen other posts here where people contact search chairs about similar questions).   2) Dear Dr. Search Chair,  I just now found the job ad for a tenure track faculty position in Sea Spider Biology.   I realize the initial review may have passed, but that applications are rolling.  Please find attached a pdf with my Cover letter, CV, Research Statement and Teaching statement. Contact info for 3 references is included.  I am submitting the same via HR.   If the committee is still considering applications, I would appreciate it if you could forward it to them for review.   Thank you for your consideration.   Sincerely,   Best Candidate Ever.  //Don't over apologize.  Send the app immediately with your first contact so you don't hassle them.   Recognize that lots of committees may not go back to that HR site after the initial data dump, so make sure you send it via email. ",NA,"Expecting to hear back after phone interview? 1) Had a phone interview a couple of weeks ago and haven't heard back. Should I expect to hear back if I did NOT make the short list or only if I did? 2) I never heard back aftr my Skype interview, but know from this board that someone else was invited for on campus interview. So I don't think hearing back is a gaurantee. 3) I never heard back from calls where I wasn't invited for an interview until much, much later when the rejection came. 4) good question. I had one last year that progressed to on site, but recently had one this year so I wonder myself... 5) I guess I wonder if it would be rude or somehow bad to check in and ask. My intuition is that there isn't a hard and fast answer and that it just varies from department to department. x2 6) They won't usually tell you if you didn't make the final interview list.7) Amazing how little respect some SCs have for their short listed applicants x2 8) I think this is one of primary functions of this board. It's extremely common not to hear back, so if I do make short list/on-campus I always update on here, and I rely on others to do so too so I can cross things off my list. Thanks to everyone who helps out! 9) I usually never heard back, but maybe 25% of the time the committee would tell me I didn't make it to the next stage. If you haven't heard back, though, don't check in. Because you never know if one of the main candidates cancels their interview and then you get called next (this happened to me). So don't give up. 10) In my experience you're unlikely to hear back even if you made a campus interview and I've only heard back from a couple of places where I had a phone interview unless it was much much later when they closed the whole search. 11) @10 unlikely to hear back even if you make an interview? How would that even work? 12) Happened to me. I had an on campus interview and never heard anything from them ever again. 10) I've had three campus interviews for jobs I didn't get. Only one of the three told me when they had made another selection. The others I found out on here or months later when I got a form rejection.  12) I actually had someone 1.5 yrs later at a conference try to avoid talking to me then awkwardly inform me I wasn't getting the job as if that were news.  They had signed the candidate 1 year earlier and I was employed elsewhere.  My god.  It's not that hard to send the email saying you picked someone else.  Candidates will appreciate being able to focus on their other offers.  I promise it will make life less awkward later-- it's not like you'll never see those job candidates again.  Some people blame HR rules, but I really don't think those are always the hold up.  13) Its because of things like this that we, as job seekers, can't help but scoff when search committees gripe about hastily-formatted cover letters and having to read too many applications. And while HR rules may prevent communication, human decency dictates that folks who ALL have temporary jobs should be informed about the status of a search within a reasonable time limit after an interview.  14) Protip to search committees:  Phone calls are difficult to FOIA, subpoena, or otherwise track for HR claims.  ""We enjoyed talking with you about your work, but in the end chose to proceed with another candidate. Thanks for applying."" 15) Yes, it's really stupid. I do my best to plan that I'll never hear anything from them again. Once I had a very clear and affirmative 'you'll hear back from us' after the phone interview but of course I heard nothing. The lies that go on during interviews are amazing. 16) It is also annoying how the HR rules thing is used as a way to absolve faculty of decent behavior. If HR has bad rules and policies, faculty should work to change those. That is the point of shared governance. I realize that in some places making those changes wouldn't be easy, but obviously other institutions have or allow different policies, so it isn't impossible. Its the same 'its out of our control' attitude that permits all kinds of bad behavior to persist in academia. 17) We'll all do the same shit when we get jobs. +2 . 18) in reply to 16, faculty self governance does not extend to being able to dictate or vote on what the central admin does. There is no way we could alter the policies of HR beyond bringing concerns to the admin and asking for them to consider changing them. 19) Shared governance is a myth. You will realize this the first time there is a state budget cut (state uni) or enrollment drops (private uni).  x3"

",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,University Locations It would be great if we could add a couple tabs used in the past. Specifically the Positions Fillend and Negotiations tabs were incredibly useful. Having gone through negotiations I can attest that it is REALLY helpful to know what ballpark you should be in.,"Just found out that if you do not ask a ton of questions of the faculty while you are interviewing, they will assume that you are not interested and are possibly only interviewing for ""practice"". Um, excuse me very much, but I did not fly hundreds of miles away from my 3-month-old infant for ""practice"". So ask a lot of questions, people. I thought I was, but that wasn't their impression.  :(  1) I recently got a similar response.  I was told I primarily didn't get a job because I wasn't ""outgoing"" and ""extroverted"" enough.  I did ask questions, but apparently not enough...  2) And if you want people to ask questions, don't talk nonstop! (3) It's a tough balance-- need to calibrate your role in each sit-down with the personality of the faculty person. 4) I'm curious to know how often this lack of outgoing-ness is something that is only said of women candidates... OP again) I am a woman. I flew halfway across the county, leaving behind my newish infant (if you've ever done this, you know how hard that is), and had to pump milk during breaks in the interview schedule. They knew about the pumping-milk thing, I had to ask for an appropriate space to do it. And yet, I wasn't ""serious"" enough. And yes, I prepped well, and dressed well, and put ""my best foot forward"" and all that. I do remember one meeting with two faculty, and I asked one more questions than the other one, and I wonder if that was the moment that I tanked without knowing it. The other critique I received was that I hadn't presented shovel-ready research projects that I'd be working on if I got hired. I'll give them that, that is something I'll definitely be including in future interviews. 1 again) I'm a woman too.  I was given some advice from a member of the search committee after the fact to read three papers from every person I was meeting with.  However, I wasn't given the second half of my schedule until a day into the interview.  With 30 people in the department, that's simply not possible.

HR doesn't allow that at my university.  Only emails allowed are after selected candidate has signed on the line (months later). 7) I'm still waiting to hear whether I got a job I interviewd for in 2014. 8) I once got a rejection letter and was confused b/c I hadn't applied to that school. Turns out it was a rejection of my GRAD SCHOOL application from exactly 10 years ago... beat that. 9) #8, that is fantastic! And #7, I hate to be the one to break this to you, but....","contacting SC after rejection 1) Is it ever appropriate to contact the SC for feedback on what you could improve upon for future reference? I suspect asking every SC this is not appropriate but what if a) you make the short list but no phone interview b) you get a phone interview but no on campus interview or c) on campus interview but didn't get the offer? 2) probably after an on-campus interview but didn't get the offer. After all, they have met you and would ""felt more obliged"" to give you some feedback since you made the trip. If you ask after shortlist or phone interviews, you would probably get something along the lines of ""hey you are a great candidate but there was another candidate with a better fit"". 3) Sometimes your advisor also can ask on your behalf, if it's someone they know. Be very careful to frame it as ""How can I improve my chances elsewhere?"" Some people will be wary of being hassled. Only ask after the phone interview if it's someone you already know well. 4) I have asked this after several on campus interviews that I didn't get and have gotten only various versions of: ""We all liked you but we went with a better fit"". I haven't been able to get anyone to give any actual useful information and I'm not sure it is really even wortwhile to ask at this point (not that it hurts to ask, I guess). 5) You're very unlikely to get any useful information by doing this, for reasons outlined here: https://scientistseessquirrel.wordpress.com/2017/06/05/how-to-write-and-read-a-job-rejection-letter/.

I have a day and a half interview, but the seminar is slated as the last thing. I'm more used to it being early to mid the first day. Would you taylor things differently in your talk if you've already gone through the rest of the interview? 2) I had an interview like that. Kind of annoying because at meetings before the seminar they didn't know about my research. Didn't change anything in the talk, but by that point I could call on audience members by their first names. 3) This is how every interview I've done was structured! I can see how it would have been a lot nicer to have already given my seminar so we'd have more chance to talk about follow up questions in the one on one meetings. 4) agree with 3; every interview I've seen has been structured this way except for one; I was the one giving the job talk and didn't particularly like it. But that's just me. Also keep in mind that everyone has a busy schedule, and seminars in the middle of the day can be very hit or miss in terms of attendance, so I think it works best when these kinds of things are scheduled when we're not slated to be in class or other meetings, etc. 4) seminars at the end of the day is the norm. 5) Something worth accounting for is that you (the speaker) will probably be tired! Ask for bathroom/coffee break for 15 min before if you can. 6) When I interviewed for the job I have now, my interview was basically the end of the day, with just a brief meeting with the search committee after (although I did have some additional tours the next morning). The place I worked before scheduled candidate seminars in the late morning, just before lunch. Both work. I think it'd be weird to have it too early. You're more comfortable after having met at least several people. And reasonable places should give you 15-30 minutes before to make sure your talk is OK and for your bathroom break etc. 7) As the interviewee I prefer late morning. Worst was the 8:30am US East Coast seminar the morning after arriving from US West coast. OP) Interesting this is more common than I thought. I'm used to lunch time-ish seminars - which mine will be before lunch on day two. Before the seminar will be mentally light - touring facilites - which is great since my jet lag will be drilling into me that that point - I have 15 min to prepare then 90 min to talk and take questions. Only thing after is lunch with graduate students. 8) A 90-min seminar?! That seems needlessly long. x2 9) I've never heard a 90 minute seminar! Even with extended questions an hour is getting very long. OP) Trust me I think it is long two. I've re-read the email several times to make sure, ""1 hour and 30 minutes allotted for the seminar and questions session"" - maybe they always start 30 min late? 10) I would ask the search chair to clairfy how long they expect the talks to actually be. 11) To revisit this, I just had an interview with 9:30am seminar and it was great! Lots of meetings asked follow up questions, so we could actually talk about research. I recommend this for sure."
NA,"No updates I applied for a couple of positions that the wiki says have had ref letters requested, or rejection letters sent out, but have not gotten a response myself. Is anyone else having this problem? For example, UW LaCrosse and Aurora University 1) if you haven't gotten a response (e.g., request for letters, interview) when others did that means you probably didn't make it and you won't receive any letter indicating that it until the entire search is over (months later), unfortunately. 2) You are allowed to email the SCC and ask if they received your materials if you never got any kind of confirmation. 3) If you made the cut but not an interview, you get to be in limbo until the search is over.

","Integrative Biology I would appreciate to know what is the field of people that consider themselves an integrative biologist. I am confused with this definition. I thought I was an integrative biologist because I use integrated approaches (morphology, genetics, genomics, etc), but my applications are not considered. Am I wrong in taking this definition? Thank you! 1) My guess is that you need to have published or thought about publishing in a journal like Integrative and Comparative Biology and could see yourself attending the Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology meeting. 2) My impression is that different search committees have VERY different ideas about what 'integrative biology' means (to be fair, it is a pretty vague term). I feel the same way about 'evolutionary ecology'. I consider myself to be both of those things as kind of core descriptors of my research, but over the past couple of years I've seen search committees pick candidates for jobs advertised in those ways that differ a lot from how I typically think of those terms. 3) Thank you. I found funny that SC considers me for positions in evolution and genetics...I never considered myself an evolution and genetics person. ha! I discovered who I am finally. 4) I'd like to have that clarity. I too use integrative approaches, including morphology, genomics and epigenetics and I have no idea where I belong. 5) Integrative Biology is just another term from ""Ecology, Evolution & Organismal"" biology that is slightly more inclusive of human physiologists & perhaps developmental biologists. Publishing in Int. Comp. Bio. has nothing to do with it. A diversity of approaches is always appreciated, but faculty in IB depts all tend to have pretty specific methods and foci, so it's analagous to a very general EEOB hire 6) @6, I think you're right for departments that call themselves 'Integrative Biology', but I don't agree with this description for searches for an 'Integrative Biologist' in a normal bio or eeob department. Typically in those cases I think the committee has a pretty specific idea of what 'integrative biology' means, it just differs a lot from one committee to the next. 7) COmmenteter #1 neglects one thing; SICB used to be the American Socity of Zoologists, there are very few plant people at SICB and few plant papers in their journal. Yet clearly study of plants can fall within IB. 8) Commenter #1 also neglects the fact that you can't publish in ICB without being invited from a symposium (although there is talk of making it open or making a sister journal). My understanding is that integrative biologists work across very broad branches of biology and other disciplines in concrete ways. In my opinion, morphology + genomics is not integrative on its own, because you could be just studying phenotype-genotype relationships, which is limited to one branch of biology (evolution). Unless you bring in another aspect (ecology, physiology, biomechanics, evo-devo, engineering, physics, behavior, neuroscience, etc), morphology + genomics is not inherently integrative.  9) IB is a just a new name for Zoology, and a lot of departments changed their names from Zoology to IB. A lot of older (and some newer) folks currently in these departments do not work across different branches. 10) Here #1 again. I see there is no an universal definition.

Is this too old school or genius? 2) I did this but with a truncated 1 page version of my proposed research (w/ figures) and some relevant citations. People seemed to respond positively to it. Got offered the job, so no harm no foul. 3) Never seen this, so not ""old school"". Not a bad idea. I personally would worry that it implies that the other person hasn't done their homework, but I'm neurotic. 4) I did the same thing, but with ""new age"" technology. I bring my ipad and have all my documents on a cloud server. Makes it super easy to pull up figures I'm working on, course syllabi I'm working on, course outlines, etc.... Only negative is that the interviewer isn't holding documents when you leave, but I just assume they would throw the documents away as soon as I walked out the door.  5) @4 just bring more ipads and leave one with everyone you meet with. x8  6) If you handed me your CV in an office visit I would think you were a narcissistic asshole who thinks I can't look you up on Google Scholar.  If you had a copy of your CV plus chalk talk outline for the search committee only, they might find that useful to follow along, but only in that narrow context.  If they are doing their job they already know your CV.  That's not the factor that will get you a job so much as showing you know your own work, can design research on your own, and can work together with the department.    Data figures from your papers to help you explain yourself might help if someone really wants to dig into your field of research but really you should be capable of drawing them from memory on a whiteboard if necessary.   You will get farther by asking the faculty there about their research with thoughtful questions than by reciting papers and journals from your CV. 7) I heard that one of my department's current faculty members brought a graphical abstract of their research program printed on nice, durable paper to refer to during the interview and to leave with the interviewer. It went over well; they got hired. I wouldn't make it a verbal repeat of anything in the application, though. 8) Do many departments really only have the search committee vote on hiring once at the interview stage? Just curious why you'd only bring handouts for the ""search committee"". I'm more familiar with all tenured and tenure-track faculty getting a vote. 9) At my department, the SC gets the final vote with input from the faculty & grad students. OP) My interview schedule suggests that there is a fromal search committe - as I have a sepearte meeting with them than with other faculty - I have a feeling that is when the formal part of the interview takes place. I then have two group faculty meetings and a session of individual meetings. I was thinking a pictoral with some words hand out - mainly for the panel meeting. I don't own a ipad or tablet of any sort - let alone enough to hand out to everyone (hehe) - so it will have to be paper. 10) 2 here - definitely hand them to everyone you have meetings with. A graphical summary especially helps for ppl who are not in your field. Nobody will think it is wierd.  6 again) A graphical research summary is a good idea if it is nicely presented.  Handing out copies of the chalk talk outline likely fills the same niche if you aren't artsy.  Make sure it emphasizes future work. "

What's the scoop: do SC's really not invite postdocs that are overseas to interview because of costs? Just want to see what you guys have experienced... Anyone else doing overseas postdocs here? (1) I did an overseas postdoc (Africa), and basically indicated that I'd be willing to cover the costs to get myself back to the states if they'd pay to fly me from a US major hub to wherever the campus was.

I worry about it as well, but usually think that it shouldn't matter: the institution is going to spend huge amounts in a startup package so they want to make sure they get the best person for the job, if that means a couple hundred more on flight, so be it.  Is that naive? 3) I did a post-doc in England and didn't get invited for an interview while there (which may or may not have anything to do with location). However, before I left I was told by the faculty member that general chaired SCs in my PhD department that being abroad can impact whether or not you are invited for interviews.

If it truly happens, I think only search committee knows. 3) I have heard of it happening from people on search committees at smaller schools that think candidates will not be happy there or that have been burned by making offers and having failed searches before. x2 4) I can imagine a situation where a more senior candidate (e.g., very close to tenure somewhere) is passed over in favor of someone younger (e.g., postdoc) despite being much stronger on paper due to fears of using the offer as leverage at the former's current institution.  5) Some assitant prof searches won't interview any associates. Dean's orders. 6) Totally agree with previous comments. In many ways I think harder to advance as an associate candidate because many searches looking junior. Also, I think as one ages, the potential on an applicant dims and the reality sets in. As in, this is what this person does, expect this. I believe this is actually one of the great biases of searches and schools miss out on many talented individuals because of age bias. Always feels good to hire a ""young gun"", but in reality the risk is higher. As 3+4 mentions though too, past expereinces and fear of failed searches can further amplify the problem. And the Dean's marching orders are also quite real. 7) @6: I agree with everything you said.  It's also somewhat understandable: assistant professors are cheaper than associates and fulls, and yeah, the associate/full already has a job, so the odds of netting the person are automatically 50:50. 8) Thanks for the comments! I'm 1), and I was more thinking in terms of applying broadly. Last year I heard back from many small, liberal arts schools but haven't made it to the next round on several this year. Just unsure whether several additional publications have made me seem unlikely to go to a small school now, or maybe my sample size is just too low.  9) You can add a little text to your cover letter to address their potential concerns: ""I am very dedicated to the mission of liberal arts colleges, blah blah blah"" 10) I was on search committee as a grad student, and we rejected one applicant who was overqualified.  The thinking was that they were unlikely to leave their current position, and were applying only to get another offer to increase their salary. 10) I've seen ""overqualified"" applicants advance in searches - maybe they did a convincing job of explaining why they desperately wanted to leave X University. Perhaps some desperation helps make the case?","This is for scheduling on-site interview. I know I should feel thankful to have an interview and not complain. But it is hard to imagine how could so many people have only 1 availabe time among the all the possible slots? The search committee said ""please rank availabe times in order"". I faithfully did that and have on-site interview on my least favorable time.. 2) Meh. Many places don't give you a choice at all. 3) They may also divvy up the spaces based on current rank of candidates + candidates ranked time slot preferences :-/ from 1) I hope it is not due to 3) ;(;(;( 4) I've had the same experience. I think that other people were more willing to just say 'can't make it' for certain slots that they didn't prefer. 5) there is also legitimate variability in applicants' schedules--teaching schedule of a faculty member/VAP v. relative flexibility of a research postdoc. Go do a good job at the interview. And remember how hard it was to get all your committee members in the same room as a grad student. <-- true that! <-true!!!!! (from OP) 5) And defintiely congrats on the on-campus interview!  6) I had a search chair try to schedule me with three days notice. Barely even enough time to do laundry before.  I refused and got 7 days notice.  She gave the preferred (and hired) candidate the last spot, and he was local so he saw everyone else's talks.  Fuck that, but yes, it happens.","TT season date When do the TT jobs ads end typically?  2)  You are going to see a lot of answers to this question, but from what I've noticed over the last 5 or so years of looking for a new gig is that there is a peak from August until now and then a second peak, although with less gigs, in the spring, as other folks (those that already held faculty positions) get new jobs and they need to be replaced.  A lot of the latter are also replaced with visiting profs and adjuncts so that a lengthier search can be done in the fall, but some departments don't want to lose the line or the money for the line, so they try to fill them ASAP after the person leaves.  Of course, some new faculty lines pop up on the spring too, but I bet most are replacement positions. 3) tails off in feb or march with the occasional straggler in April. #2's suggestion that they are same-year replacement ads seems unlikely; evern if negotiations are done by december and someone is leaving, getting the beuracracy to crank out an immediate ad is a tall task.  In past years my R1 has advertised its first set of jobs in ~january because it took 6 months for the dean to decide we get the FTE and then a job ad to be approved. 4) I agree with #3. I don't think most of the ads in the spring are replacements for people who left earlier that year or in the previous fall (unless it was relatively early in the fall, I guess). 5) Scroll down to row 34 and see for yourself.  Since that's a graph of cumulative jobs posted, look at the slope for the rate of job addition. OP) Thanks very much for the info!",NA,"Practice your chalk-tak! I will have my first interview with a chalk talk in a couple of weeks. My advisor was great and organized for me to have a practice during a Faculty meeting in their Department. This practice was extremly important, because it revealed that I had no clue on how properly lead a chalk talk (R1 context). If I went to the first interview without this practice, I would have bombed it and for sure wouldn't get the offer. Of course having practiced it does not mean I will get the offer, but for sure I am waaaaay more aware of what to expect, and on how to write things on the board, and on what to write on the board. It is way more important to practice this than the job talk. 2) Thanks for the advice! In my experience, mock interviews are really awkward, but also really helpful. 3) OP here agai. Yes, definitely awkward, but definitely worth it! 5) LOL. Amazing 6) I second this advice. Practice chalk talks are very important, esp if you've never done one before",NA,"Paper accepted after application due date Contact the search committee after application has been submitted to let them know or not?  2) Absolutely. Attach the final draft and updated CV.  I personally know more than 1 candidate who made the cut because of a postdoc paper getting accepted. 3) Seems a bit much to me. Isn't it listed as in revision on your CV? x2 4) Don't bother unless its super-prestige (Science/Nature) and even then, it may have no effect. More important is if you get a major grant (>$100k). 5) I would not do this. x3 6) I would definitely do this if it were a super-prestige paper and I would ABSOLUTELY DEFINITELY do this if it were a major grant. Bringing in funding is huggggggge. It's just shooting a short, polite email to the chair. x 2 7) The original poster didn't ask about major funding. Following up about a $100K+ grant is reasonable, pestering people because a mid-tier paper was accepted seems counterpoductive. I'm sure many candidates have papers accepted after submitting applications. It would be annoying if I was on a SC and every applicant sent me CV updates in the days/weeks after submission."
NA,"SC decision process SC and offer process: What goes on after all candidates have interviewed? I realize that at some point the SC meets, makes a pick, the department votes, and later approved by higher-ups. But, I have some questions and would like to hear what from others how this process is different. Does each facutly memeber (even those without tenure) get 1 vote? Is there a general meeting of all faculty where votes are tallied? If you don't attend, can faculty email or relay their vote later? Does the SC chair have veto power? Does the dept. chair have veto power?  Any insight into this mysterious process would help. I like to dream about one day going through it myself (either as a candidate or SC member). Till then, I can only dream... 1) Probably all of the above. Their is no one answer, everywhere is different. But minimally, it might just come down to the search committee choices, the department chairs OK, and then the deans approval. But all of that can take weeks...
2) Totally depends on the department/institution. The method I've seen the most of is this: SC is responsible for finding candidates to interview and meeting all of them. Basically SC is responsible for really paying attention to the search so that everyone doesn't have to if they don't want. SC discusses the candidates and brings its recommendation to the department, typically in the form of a ranked list plus who is not acceptable. SC chair has no special power, it's more of a service obligation (hopefully one they want) than a privilege. Department then discusses. Some departments will just go with the SC recommendation, but usually they just take it into account but are not bound by it. Department (all tenure-track faculty) then votes to produce a ranked list of acceptable candidates for the chair. Absentee ballots may or may not be allowed (since it's not clear what motion will be on the table, this is somewhat difficult). The chair is not bound by the department's vote, but in practice, they will follow the department's wishes or face a full-blown mutiny. The dean probably has veto power too, but this should be extremely rarely exercised. Key point for interviewees: every vote in the department counts, so try to have good interactions even with those who might be far afield from the search/your research. (3) I've seen searches where only the SCs votes count and searches where everyone in the department or in the division's vote counts. I've also heard tell of vetos from both the Dean and Provost, though in my very limited experience I have never seen this happen. (4) I was on a SC as a grad student where it did happen. The department wanted to hire two people, but the Dean vetoed it. Then the Dean vetoed the SC's first choice because of funding concerns. (5) Unless the department had two FTEs (full time equivalents) worth of funding in hand, the dean didn't veto it, (s)he just didn't cough up the extra $. (6) I know of a dean vetoing a decision because it did not meet diversity requirements, instead of picking the most qualified candidate (a white male) they picked a considerably less qualified candidate (a Hispanic female) (7) That's been happening for some time now. It's obviously working! Evo/eco/behav sections and bio departments everywhere are nowadays way too diverse with under qualified faculty. I know of some EEB programs with only one white male among 40-50 diverse faculty (we jokingly refer to him as the token white) and, I know that sole, most qualified white male tans. (and just between us, I think he's half white and half something else) 8) Ahh, sarcasm...so cathartic! (9) Here we go again, asking about SC procedures and end up back on the oh so important ""diversity"" issue...(10) That's a keen observation #9. (11) #6 - I am sure this happens (certainly know of some cases!) BUT >50% of ecology grad students are now women and <50% of new hires are women... so something is still going on. I know at my former institution, the department (2 tenure track women, ~50 faculty) always managed to interview at least one woman per search. And she was never the first choice (although I thought often the best candidate). One I thought was great was ~7 month pregnant (most pubs, great teaching record, millions in grants as lead PI - in her first post doc). She was basically not even considered - although no one came out and said why. Wonder if any of the men were expecting children? (12) Let's see... we have depts with a ""token white male"" among ~50 faculty (#7), and then we have depts with ~50 faculty of whom 2 are women (#11). Sounds like we're even. So, case closed? (13) I also was told by someone on a SC that often the most qualified people they kept getting were males. I agree that women should certainly be better represented in the faculty hires - many of the places i applied to had 0-3 females in their department! that's pathetic. Overall though, the most qualified should get the job. 
9) Refer to the Fitting in post on 1-29-2010. There are some good points brought up there on this issue. ""Most qualified"" means nothing! The whole hiring process is subjective.  (10) Many studies have compared applications with and without names indicated, and have found men to be ranked higher when they know the candidate is male. Gender bias is still strong in Ecology.

I would be coming from a relatively low cost of living area and I am unsure what salary would be reasonable to be able to live off of in LA. I know housing varies by neighborhood but thought this would be a good start. 2) I lived there for grad school 7 years. It depends a lot on the location and you'll have more options if you own a car. After a lot of hunting I was always able to get a studio for ~1200 in a nice location, and I know someone with a 2 bedroom in the hollywood hills for ~2300/mo (without utils). Both of these are good deals though in coveted locations. That said, rents have been jacking up the past two years so it's hard to know. Assume you will pay a TON for parking/transport, food is cheap if you cook, and drinks are expensive if you go to bars 3) I was close to LA as a pdoc 2 yrs ago.  I think I could get by with just me, no dependents, and have a pretty great lifestyle on $60k.  If you're talking R1 like UCLA or USC you should get $75k absolute minimum without counter offers.  A Cal State or smaller teaching school, I would hope they wouldn't offer less than $65k.  Prices drop a lot on housing if you can live some place like Culver City.   Ask your school if they offer any housing assitance (down payment, faculty housing) 4) For all the CA public schools you can look up salaries for all professors on transparent california. Cal state schools in LA actually start at more like 72-75k in biology, but they don't go up nearly as high at the full prof level as one of the UC schools would. I've also been looking into the affordability here and wondering if anyone has lived there with spouse + 2 kids without having a terrible commute and in a decent neighborhood. 5) if you're actually negotiating faculty at UCLA I can tell you salaries when I was there started ~110k+. Postdocs often made $50–60k+ (but not 75k), but (4) is right that all salaries for the UC and Cal State systems are available online 6) OP here, thanks for the info. I am looking up info on the UC and Cal State schools which are helpful also. I would be at a SLAC so I think the Cal State salaries are closest. My hesitation is that I will be supporting my family of 4 and I also do not want a horrible commute. Still trying to get a good feel for it since I am currently in an area with a low cost of living (I rent a 3 br house for $800/month). Any more insight is appreciated! 2) me again. The unfortuante thing about the LA area is that all commutes are horrible. I lived 4 miles from work and it would take 60–90 minutes each way (that was bus + walking, if I had a car it would probably take 45 each way but then you pay 1-2k per year to park). People accommodate this by having odd hours--I knew profs who would get in at 5 am and leave at 1pm, or get in at 11am and leave at 11pm to beat traffic, but there's not a set 'rush hour' like other cities so it's hard to predict. If you can work (organize your lesson plan in your head) or relax (listen to a podcast) while you drive it will help. It just becomes and unfortunate part of life 7) I second the previous post - lived 4 miles from UCLA, routinely took 45mins-1hr to get into school. I had to go during regular hours due to day care schedule - could probably have made it in under 30mins in the middle of the night. Traffic is unavoidable, even when not commuting (e.g., running errands, like grocery shopping), and is the biggest reason I was happy to leave. It's as bad as, or worse than, everyone says it is. Cost of living was high, but you can definitely find lower rent places to live within reach of most places in LA - just have to be willing to sacrifice a little in terms of neighborhood or amenities. With daycare for one kid, rent, and driving/gas costs, we were fine on a 60k salary - just without many other expenses!",NA,"Does anybody care about equity and inclusion in Europe? Perhaps this should be in 'venting', but I am trying to focus on the application process, and wanted to ask for opinions that contradict me: my extremely cynical and painfully acquired opinion is that hardly anybody in Europe **who is in a position to hire** cares much about equity, teaching, inclusion, or anything like that. I think that's why they rarely if ever ask for teaching or diversity statements: the people who hire simply don't seem to care about that, they just want papers. Many institutions still ask you for the impact factor of the journals you've published in. It is not a problem for many European institutions if the entire faculty is composed of white men. Even in the middle of large European cities, there are several departments with only one (token?) woman and perhaps one person of color... and they're often the same person!. I don't think many of the people in these institutions even realize that this is a problem, which is why they don't bother asking what you think about it in the applications. The truly sad thing is that Europeans themselves are not like that at all; it's just that their institutions somehow seem to not have made it into this century yet in terms of equity. 2) I think this is a bit of a complex issue. First, I dont think it is neccessarily appropriate to lump teaching in with equity and inclusion, as the equity/inclusion issue applies equally to research / training and inclusion of researchers. And many places in Europe do place a large emphasis on teaching (in the department I am in all undergrad and masters courses are tought by senior professors, and teachign experience is a large part of hiring decisions for those positions here). At the same time many R1s in the US could care less about what you say in your teaching statement, unless you have done something big like developed entire undergrad courses from scratch. As for the diversity/equity issue, I agree that it does seem like many departments in europe are populated by professors that are all old men, especially compared to recent faculty in ecology and evolution hired in north america. But here the comparison is a bit difficult; people at the stage of assistant professor in n america would often be on soft money in at an equivelent career stage in european institutions, listed as 'researchers', etc. and the title of professor is reserved for what in north america would be a senior (at least tenured, or even endowed chair) professorship (which are also more likley to be old men, everywher). This makes the comparison a bit difficult. But given all of that, I do think there is a difference in academic culture here compared to the current environment in North America; although there is definelty awareness of gender gaps and a push for gender equity, I get the impression that many here view broader issues of diverisity and inclusion as more a challenge for society as a whole rather than the duty of research scientists. That said, I suspect even in North America that things like diversity statements are taken seriously in some searches and not read at all in others 2) here again- just forgot to say this is my perspective as someone from north america, who did there phd in north america, and has been a postdoc for 2 years now in northern europe 3) OP here. Thanks, @2! It's really helpful to have another perspective. I find it frustrating how few women so many departments in Europe have, and when you mention it, everyone agrees it's a problem, but then the searches don't reflect that (and I don't mean hiring women preferentially, I mean simply asking what the candidate would do to try and improve the situation). Same with minorities of color. Take the UK, for example, and look at how many Bangladeshi/Indian/Pakistani/Black-Caribbean people there are as members of Faculty in any STEM department. Germany is the same with Turkish people (in fact, you'd be lucky if you even find any Turkish people as STEM students!), and same in France with (French-speaking) Africans. Yet nobody asks you what you'd do to improve things when you apply (as far as I've seen at least). In the US, maybe most departments just do it to look good, I really don't know, but at least they ask you, and eventually it will matter to somebody, even at the most cynical of universities. 4) I submit this answer with honesty, integrity, and hope for serious discussion: My instinct is that the concept of diversity is a hollow cry in the US; it is something corporations and universities (which are basically tax-exempt corporations) use to outwardly display righteous behavior. Europeans (in my experience) don't feel the need to do that. More importantly, with all due respect to you and to civilized debate, I don't find any facts to support your argument that ethnic ""equity"" is low in universities in the majority of European countries. 5) In my experience interviewing and visiting departments in both the US and EU, I've encountered departments that are either all white dudes or, conversely, highly diverse wrt gender representation in both places. Sadly, racial or ethnic diversity is universally low in EEB-related departments worldwide. I DO agree, though, that near-term research productivity trumps teaching and diversity in the EU, while they would factor into hiring and tenure decisions in the US. 6) Europeans really don't care much about diversity. I suppose there are political reasons. Most of western Europe still has a functioning safety net so concerns about diversity, gender equality or the disabled rarely have much of resonance. At the core of much of the debate in the US about diversity concerns wealth and power and in Europe where very few have power because of a strong middle class and virtually no poverty, I don't think diversity as an issue has gained steam because most people have little or no power in the first place or at least a similar amount of power. I've interviewed at a few places in the US and met with European trained women faculty who have somewhat laughed at the issue of sexual harassment because it's largely a non-issue because it's so widespread, especially verbal harassment (i.e., not physical) and could be why they left Europe (I don't know). Of course these are anecdotes but I agree with the OPs observation. With center-right or right wing governments dominating Europe now (see Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, Hungary, etc.), I don't expect much change. Doing a postdoc in Scandinavia was a huge eye-opener - as progressive and liberal they may be on paper, deep down they are as xenophobic and racist as anyone from the rural American South x2 7) OP again. I don't know, my experience, as I mentioned above, is that Europeans are not racist at all, and certainly not in academia. I think that the white men that run most universities in Europe are simply a bit blind to the fact that there is a problem with inclusion and equity (I name the case of the all-but-absent STEM students of Turkish descent in Germany or of African-descent in France). Those who do see the problem don't seem to be able to put 2 and 2 together and realize that it's their freaking job to do something about it. And I mean their job, really, because universities in Europe are largely public institutions, so they're running on taxes, i.e. they are ultimately for the betterment of society. 8) I experienced blatant misogyny in Sweden, but when I raised the issue no one ""knew what to do"". Just sweep it under the rug. It'll be fine. They also have notoriously nepotistic hiring practices. I've encountered a good number of South Asians in UK departments though.9) Most of Europe is run nepotistically. Traditionally, it's been typical to study, get a PhD and do a postdoc and get a permanent faculty position, all at the same university, no questions asked. It's slowly changing though, especially in Germany where to get a faculty job you have to pass a university search committee, outside committees and their federal science foundation, maybe even federal ministries. They all get to decide if you and your work  is in the national interest or not. I suppose that's because of nepotism. 10) In Sweden, it's par for the course for postdocs to end up as junior faculty in their departments, and departments often have basically no one trained elsewhere. Conveniently enough, department heads are also deeply involved in the funding process. They just introduced new rules that mean you can't land a TT position if you have more than five years experience, which probably won't help. Austria and Norway also have external evals, although Norwegian departments mysteriously seem very Norwegian. 11) It is funny that in academia training someone for 5+ years and then hiring them to stay at your department is considered undesirable nepotism whereas for most private businesses hiring good people after spending years training them is the norm. 12) Same with medical school, many people intern and do their residency in places where they end up working. Moving across the country every 3-5 years to start new projects and in new systems is the most inneficient way to do things, makes sense that it is the American way. 13) In practice internal hires can result in the head of the department surrounding themselves with hand-picked yes-people who won't challenge them. So yeah, that's undesirable. 14) Amen to 11&12! Our aversion to ""hiring our own"" is strange, expensive, canabalistic and self-defeating.",NA,"Personal websites? Yes. x2 OP) So search committees actually google applicants? I'm fresh out of a PhD and don't feel I have enough pubs/accomplishments to warrant a website. 2) I've been meaning to build a website for over 2 years now, but finding it difficult to justify the time needed to build a quality site. Any recommendations for a quick, easy to use website builder? 3) You can get free website templates at https://html5up.net/ 4) You definitely need a website, even if it is simple. Wordpress or wix would be fine. 5) second wordpress or wix. I don't know how important it is, departments hit my website after I apply, and every department I have interviewed at has looked at it. I am sure I would have had interviews without the web presence. Unless you have an interesting blog or podcast or outreach that isn't in your application, I don't know what else they would glean from it. 6) A personal website could be harmful if it identifies your ethnicity/gender. There can be a preference for hiring from certain ethnic and/or gender groups, so identifying yourself could possibly lower your chance of getting an interview. I sat on a search committee where the majority decided [number] of [ethnicity] [gender] coming to campus would not look good. They learned this information from personal websites. 7) having served on several SCs, I can confirm that they *absolutely* google applicants, and web presence can be very helpful, but doesn't seem to be a deal breaker. Simply put, SCs like to know everything they can, but the dirty little secret is that every SC member is overworked and - have a seat before reading further - many simply do not read your statements. It's a LOT more common than you'd like to believe. I view statements like letters in which your supervisors say you're the best thing since sliced bread. These things just don't provide much predictive power in terms of how productive of a scientist you'll be moving forward. The best predictor of a colleagues future productivity is what they've actually accomplished to that point. So, will having a website make any difference in whether or not you get an interview? I think not, but then it's impossible to know something like this with any degree of certainty. I use both Wordpress and Weebly for a variety of sites, and I highly recommend Weebly over Wordpress. Weebly isn't free, but I firmly believe it's TOTALLY worth the cost. Pay to have a URL instead of something like ""interestingpersonswebsite.myfreewixsite.com""... Just Google ""how to make a website"" and you'll find infinite quality resources. I created a good website as a postdoc, and when I got a job the transition was seamless and it attracted interest from graduate students immediately. I understand one's desire for privacy, but, seriously, if a department decides not to hire you because of things totally outside of your control, you truly do NOT want to work there. Thus, my recommendation would be not to worry at all about revealing gender, race, etc. 8) Make sure you have a Google Scholar page. It counts citations and shows all your pubs. Probably even more important than a website. 9) I made a weebly site during grad school, and hooked it up to google analytics. So now I can see where people are accessing my site from. Was useful for when I was applying to postdocs and now for faculty positions. I can tell they are indeed looking! I think its a nice place to highlight all the other things I've done that I wasn't able to discuss in detail in my application materials due to size contraints. 10) I agree with #9 and @6 some of us can't hide our identities anyways. My name very clearly tells on my ethnicity. 11) @7, what would you recommend when your sexual harasser is in your field and is your direct competitor on research topics? I have not made a website for that reason. I do not want that person to know what I am working on or thinking about until it's published/preprinted (and obviously won't apply to their institution). 7) @11 obviously everyone's situation is different. Do what you want, but we all have competitors who would like to scoop us. I personally think the benefit of a website that describes things you've done (not things in the works) exceeds the associated costs. 12) @11, I'm sorry you're having to deal with that. I can understand not wanting to put yourself out there more for that reason. But if you do kind of want an online presence without putting it all out there, I know people whose website is just 1 main page with very short decriptions of their interests and publications, with links to their google scholar. 13) I can also recommend to host your website on GitHub. There are templates for academic websites or you pay a friend to whip something up in CSS. The you just have running costs for the domain but the hosting is free. 14) One downside to having a website is being aware when you're being looked at...and then getting no response for a week+? Is that normal? I read into this kind of interaction as my application being tossed, but I have been getting ~2 hits a week from a school I applied to at the beginning of November but have heard nothing. "

When a job asks for teaching evaluations, would it be best to just include the course I taught and offer to provide more upon request in the cover letter, or should I include reports from all my time as a TA as well? Thanks! 2) I am in exactly your position - lots of TA experience, only 1 instructor of record course. I included teaching evaluations for at least one semester/section for each different course I taught or TA-ed. I thought it a good idea to show my breadth of experience, even if most of that was as a TA. FWIW, I did not provide photocopies of any of my evals - just summarized each course in a table, and selected students' comments to include. I noted that scanned copies of all evals were available upon request. 3) I assume many of us have TA experience so I just include a summary of my evaluations from the course where I was the instructor on record, including specific comments by students.  4) SC member here, put this stuff in your teaching statement.  I put quotes from the written evaluation in my teaching statement as well. 5) Should I put the summarized table and quotes in my teaching statement for all positions (including large public R1s), or just for schools that maybe have emphasize teaching quality slightly more? 6) #4 here, @ 5), we do (sorta) care about this stuff at R1s also... so why not include it?

Happy Halloween..... x5 2) If the stats is correct, they requested letters for ca. 50% of applicants. That means that I didn't even make the top half of the applicant pool. Happy Halloween indeed. 3) I'm holding out a little hope that only some of the SC's have sent out requests. Maybe all the people who have been contacted arent in the same pool as me. I thought I was a pretty good fit. 4) just chiming in, I got a letter request (first time ever) and I am in behavioral ecology - so maybe just that SC reported. 5) OP here, congrats #4. Good luck! <--thank you, and likewise! 6) Also in behavioral ecology and got a letter request. x2 4) Good fit or not...no shame in not being in the top 50% for a top tier job like Washington. The pool was probably huge, with some very well established applicants. 5) So much of this whole process is ""fit"" and what research areas happen to grab the attention of the SC. I know of extremely successful, big shot asst. profs who didn't get interviews for one of UW's past cluster hires--it's not just about your credentials or how hard you work. That fact is both frustrating and reassuring. 6) Where is this 50% of applicants got letters requested number coming from? Wasn't it 600 applicants? Does that mean letters were requested for 300?! That seems obscenely high. 7) A few years ago so many people were bumped because they were not in the top 20% of U. missouri job search. It happened just before thanksgiving. 8) huh...I guess I""m glad someone wants to move to Missouri .9) Im in evo-genetics and I got nothing. sads. 10) To #6, ca. 45% of the wiki users that applied got letters requested, so it's just an extrapolation. 11) Population ecology letters requested 12) 50% of the people that applied did not get asked for references. The number of people that say they applied is not an accurate real number nor an accurate index of the total people that applied. i wish people (including bloggers) would stop using data from this wiki in such an irresponsible way. The numbers are garbage and not meaningful. I am suprised that anyone would try to ‘extrapolate’ with them. 13) #12, where are you getting your information from. I'm not at Washington, but I've served on three in the past and the general rule of ""the number of people who applied on the wiki x10"" was accurate within 15 applications on all 3 searches, and other SC members have said the same thing on this forum. 14) I suspect the wiki x10 rule-of-thumb may not hold well for this position - I would believe they got 600 *ecology-evolution* applications, but then many times that for the other  focal areas x2 15) I'm in a department for one of the searches on the wiki right now--the field of apps was 20x the wiki ""applied"" number. 16) @15 - was it an eco/evo search or more general? Maybe you could add the #apps to the wiki (doesn't seem particularly confidential info). 17) The discussion on the main page links to a committee member's tweet stating that there were >1000 application (!!!). And they requested letters from 99 applicants","10 min Skype Interview Has anyone heard of a 10 minute Skype interview?  What could be the goal?  I've never had less than a 30 minute phone or Skype interview. 1) I had one last year. It was horrible mostly because I didn't believe them when they said it would be short. Hence, I started too ""big picture"" when desribing my research - it's a big topic, really! - and they cut me off before I could get to specifics. Based on their next question, it became apparent they really wanted to know what programs I use (R, GIS, that type of thing) and what I could teach. Hence, I would suggest practicing the ""elevator speech"" version of your research. 2) I would say they're going to ask even broader thing. They're probably just spot checking if you are crazy/legit. 3) Agree with number two. I had a 10 min Skype interview last month and it was a bit odd, although right on time. I really think it was just a sanity check. I practiced having short ~2min answers to a range of questions. It turns out, to my surprise, they never even asked about my research, which I had practiced the most, but presumably because most of this is already in your research statement. 4) I had one this short last year. I agree, practice short anecdotes. Additionally, I was always taught that a way for then to know what you care about is to ask questions. I was not allowed to ask questions at the end of the 10 minutes, so make sure you let them know what is really important about you in your (short) answers to your questions. FWIW I made it past this really short interview to on-campus. Agree with above about it mostly being a sanity check. 5) Thank you so much!  What happened after?  I see 4 went next to on-campus interview.  Is there ever a second longer Skype before on campus? 6) #1 here. In my interview the first question was about my research so in my case, at least, maybe they were interested in folks who could describe their research briefly and succinctly. 7) I had one a couple of years ago and it got me an on campus. It was strange and I had 5 mins to talk about research and 5 to talk about teaching.  I wrote out very specific talking points to make sure I hit on everything in a short time. 8) I had a short skype call this year ~ first question was ""do you have any questions for us"". I was totally thrown off-guard, no campus invite, whomp whomp. 9) SC member here: Goal: narrow a tough long list down to a short list. Conversations on each candidate raise many questions, and when they are bunched up, it gets hard, and just a couple questions with a candidate can help resolve. 10 min a little short though! 10) had one last year that asked for a course description with just a few days notification and then they said they do short sype interviews becasue they had sooooo many applications to read that it was just easier to skype :( ",NA,"re-applying in the same year Similiar to the below thread...what about applying for a different position at a small school?

I believe the chair is the same person? 2) Just do it (TM) 3) go for it. 3) Yes, just apply if you are remotely qualified. Don't waste any time feeling awkward/weird about this stuff. You likely have little idea of why you weren't selected for position A, and also have little idea what they are looking for in position B. Always apply if you are a little bit qualified and actually want the position. 4) I agree, apply. But it might also be good to talk to the chair upfront (email or phone) and explain your logic    5) always, always, always apply.  Most will have a different search committee.

 1) I typically put way too much time into every application. Trying to tailor myself precisely to the instituion and the job. Consequently, I talk myself out of applying for lots of jobs because of the time demands If I look back over last year, by phone interview rate was poorly coorelated with time invested in application. I'm starting to think a new strategy is in order. 2) It depends. I really think it takes a sentence or two in the cover letter to let them know you have thought about the position they have posted is important. I also have a template for type of institution (R1 vs MS vs SLA). The positions that are not exactly in my field (for example I am much of an ecologist than an evol. biologist but I can pass as the latter) that can take more time. I rarely change my teaching statement and I do mold my research statement to institution type and and slighly to location. Finally, I do spend some more time double checking and perfecting apps for dream jobs and may send out a less polished application for a less desirable job. I've never quantified the time but it is a lot. It is a big deal. 3) I have templates for my teaching philosophy, my cover letter, and my research statement that I tweak for each position. The teaching philosophy rarely changes much, but my cover letter and research statement have certatin areas that I tweak depending on the job.  I also updated the templates for each of those yearly to reflect major changes.  The time it takes for me to assemble a single job application probably takes a couple of days, because I read over them over and over again being OCD before I send them out, but in the end the templates aren't all that majorly different from each other.  I'm at the point where I apply to very few jobs in my plight to leave a tenured Associate Professor position for a school in a better location and I typically at least end up on the short list for every position I apply for, so I think my materials are pretty solid, but last year I only made it to one phone interview and no campus interviews.  Rough year.  Hoping this year is it, but who the hell knows anymore. 4) It goes against the conventional wisdom these days, but if you don't apply for a) jobs that you wouldn't accept, b) jobs that are outside of your area of expertise, and c) jobs for which you simply aren't qualified, you'll find that you have plenty of time to tweak and tailor your 6-8 applications per year as well as you need to.  Most people on the market these days apply to way too many jobs.  No one person is qualified for 80, 60, or even 20 jobs in our field in most years.  This means they lose time that they could be spending on teaching/publishing/tailoring their letters better.  Not to mention the loss of letter-writer and search committee time.  So OP, it's probably good that you talk yourself out of some jobs apps.  Focus on the ones that are the best bet and put a lot of time into them.  (5) it depends on the application.  I now have letters written for multiple positions that I can just tweak, but I still do a lot of tweaking.  I am considering re-formulating some of my stuff from last year.  (6) I've watched the job market for more than a decade.  If you are not qualified to apply for >6-8 jobs each year, your background is pretty weak or your confidence is awful low.  6-8 R1 positions I can buy, more likely 2-3 R1 positions in any given season.  However, Liberal arts and regional universities advertise very open descriptions most of the time.  Things like Ecology, Anatomy, Genetics. (7) #4 here.  I don't really see anything in post #6 that refutes what I said.  If the point is that people apply to R1, liberal arts, regional universites (and perhaps CCs), then again, my response is that those people are applying for a lot of jobs for which they're not qualified.",I was so excited about the appearance of a snail-mail letter in my office mailbox - I never get those any more. Turns out it was a sweet letter of rejection. Like I f-ing care. x-(  ,NA,NA,"Interview Timing For people who have had a few interviews: how long have you usually had between being notified of an interview (phone or campus) and the interview itself? Have you generally been given a few options for dates or is it pretty rigid? Or is it all just variable from school to school? Trying to wrap my head around what I might need to do if I am lucky enough to get an interview this season during an already very busy fall and winter. 2) I've had some phone and Skype interviews. They were ususally scheduled a week or so after I was notified, and I'm pretty sure I was always given a choice of dates and times. Best of luck to you! 3) In-person interviews seem to be scheduled 2-3 weeks in advance, and so far I've been given at least 2 different dates and asked which worked and for my preference. (x3) 4) It really depends on the university/search committee.  Sometimes, my interviews were scheduled quickly after the invitation and other times my interview was scheduled a month after the invitation. 5) Mine ranged from ""can you come on this specific date in two weeks"" to ""pick a time within the next month"".  I've heard of people being asked to attend an on-campus interview with only a week's notice.  6) I've had 6 campus interviews, most give you 3-4 weeks heads up, but I just did one with only a 1.5 week notice.  Usually they have a few times selected, but if they talk to you last, you may not get much choice unless you absolutely can't do the time they have selected.  They're usually juggling a lot of people's schedules, so it's best to be as flexible as possible.","The tone of the conversations on the Wiki these days is pretty dismal: it's stressful to get a job. It's hard to get a job. No one updates on job search progress. Once you get a job, you'll probably still be miserable. Your department wants to exploit you. Does anyone have anything uplifting to balance this out?? It's only October. 2) Silly cat videos? x5 3) to 1: most of the interviews come near or after thanksgiving. To give you a sense about how things go for (efficient) search commitee. After deadline, many still dont have letters submitted. We send out emails to request for missing letters. A week later, most of the letters are submitted, then we start to carefully read the applications.  It took us two weeks to read (more than 400) applications and a bunch of papers of the promising candidates, and we will discuss within the committee. You see, it's 3-4 weeks after the deadline already. I know many other universities are much slower than us. Best of luck and be positive. 4) agree with #3-- it's a process that's bounded on one side and not on the other.  It easily takes longer than it should, and never less. 5) to OP, at least Obama is still president...oh wait.... 6) You don't need letters to make the first cut. 6) Maybe I'm in the minority, but I am wicked happy in my TT position. 7) '400 applications,' cmon now 8) While it's entirely reasonable that there's no news when there's nothing to report, it's crazy frustrating that search committees *rarely* tell applicants when there's been progress made, or even when the search has completed. x4  8) to 6: I agree with the idea that requesting letters before the first cut is a burden for both students and PIs, but I often see it very useful as SC, as good letters can address the obvious weakness of applications. Many applications are strong, but except the very few rare telent, most of applicants (even strong ones) have weakness. Outstanding letter writers can often justify the weakness. 9) Just curious, SC members: how often do you read letters before making the first cut? 10) https://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2013/09/19/advice-how-north-american-faculty-position-search-committees-work/ 11) I never read letters, at any time during review of applications. I have served on approximately 10 search committees. There's always someone that reads through them all on every search committee I have served. I pretty much ask that person, ""Hey, are all the letters lovey-dovey?"" If that person says yes, I see no reason to judge any candidate based on what someone says about them in a letter. Every candidate is perfect for a job at my institute, or some other institute (letter writers regularly forget to change institution in their form letters that they write for candidates), according to their letter writers. 12) I read all the letters of candidates that pass my first cut, usually top 50%. 13) I mainly read the letters, plus the CV.  You'd be astonished how many letters are not lovey-dovey! Then I skim the research statement, maybe. 9) Not often, it would appear, and even less so when there are more applicants, I would suppose. 13) when there's a ton of applications, you can tell a lot by what journals they publish in.  Haven't published any papers in the top speciality journals (e.g. ecology for an ecology search)? Probably not a good fit. 14) How do you know if a bad letter is due to the writer being an ass? 15) @14, unfortunately you don't, that falls on the candidate to magically know.","Adjuncting I'm considering taking a leave from my research-focused postdoc to do a summer semester/class at a local community college to get some real teaching experience. Does adjuncting help or does it hurt? I've heard from different people that it can work either way.  2) Depends on your goal.  If that's a research-intensive R1, then I think you'd be better off working on papers.  If your goal is more teaching oriented, then it might help. 3) OP--yes, thinking a more teaching oriented school. 4) Can you do both simultaneously rather than taking a leave? CCs offer night and weekend classes. I worked with my supervisor to adjunct teach last spring and it all worked out. I think it helped a lot with getting interviews at PUIs this round. 5) think strongly about what #4 said, or if 'taking a leave' means that you can go back to your postdoc, that serves the same purpose (having a course you've taught yourself on your c.v.).  A mentor at a SLAC once told me that their hiring decisions rarely turn on teaching experience - they feel that they can help turn motivated faculty into good teachers. 6) I'm a new faculty at a SLAC, but have to say that I disagree with 5's mentor. Our school's hiring process places teaching experience highly on our candidate rankings unless we're hiring a VAP (and only then, because we only do those to hire on a quick turnaround). We hire teachers first and foremost, though SLACs come in all shapes and sizes, so opinions will obviously differ.",NA,"update search committee When is it appropriate to update a search committee with changes to a CV?

Someone keeps noting that there are multiple applicants for certain positions and all I can say when I see that is ""duh"".  Of course there are multiple applicants.  What we want to know is how many of you (users of this Wiki) have applied to begin with and later down the line the total number of applicants if possible.  Sorry, I'm OCD about stuff like this. 2) OP: honestly I thought that column was to reflect how many positions were open as there are a few places advertising multiple positions. I think it's a bit early to know how many wiki users have applied as these deadlines haven't passed. I've added a column for this info and removed the info in the other column for now.  3)  OP here.  This Wiki will run until some time next summer, so, yes, it is a bit early, but those numbers will be filled in along the way.  Despite two schools looking to fill multiple positions in the same areas of expertise, such things are not the norm, so I think that column will be mostly empty, but it's interesting info to have.","Had a wonderful interview visit except one truly horrible person (faculty member) that obviously has another horse in the race.

I feel like a suit would be too formal for an E&E interview, and I am very fashion-challenged. What do you go for? 2) Female perspective: I think business casual (e.g. slacks and a sweater) is nice for interviews. Suits are a little too formal.  I've heard SCs frown on sandals so maybe leave your chacos at home ;) 3) Wear a suit. You are going for a job interview.  4) there were two searches when I was in grad school, and most if not all wore suits for the day they gave their talk. 5) Really department specific. At my R1 grad school you would definitely have been out of place in a suit for E & E/anthro/wildlife department, but neuro/physio candidates usually wore suits. 6) Someone is going to hate what you wear, no matter what it is.  And someone else is going to love it.  So wear something that makes YOU feel comfortable, professional, and powerful.  I think it's better to wear your best solid tshirt and khakis than to wear a collared shirt with square fold marks straight from the package b/c you didn't know you had to iron the thing. 6) Consider region and focus. If you're interviewing at Georgetown, you're more likely to get stuffy faculty evaluating you and you're at a university with a very non-ecological focus. If you're interviewing at a large school of ecology, wildlife, or natural resources and you're west of the Mississippi, I don't think a suit is the default - like #5, sometimes you'd be a bit out of place, but I'm not sure anyone would hold it against you. 7)#3 again here. I have to say again...please wear a suit. You are going to meet the dean and perhaps the provost or very senior people of the administration. They are wearing suits and you are wearing your T-shirt and khakis...... They are the ones who are going to have the final approval of your appointment. Impress them.  8) as someone in a natural resource dept. west of the Mississippi, the faculty here often wear ties to teach, so yeah, wear a suit at least on the day of your seminar. 9) I think slacks, collar shirt & tie, and a sport coat is what I'd recommend (unless the interview is in a very warm climate). When I was interviewing I wore a corduroy jacket (very professorial - but I bought it for the occacion), shirt & tie, and khaki or dress slacks. 10) Speaking from seeing lots of job talks at an EEB-type department, natural history museum, and biology department I have NEVER seen a male candidate wear a suit -- although one seminar speaker claimed to be wearing a suit while wearing a sports jacket. I wonder if the person insisting on it is thinking of a sports jacket and slacks? I would go button-down + slacks + tie, maybe a jacket. 11) #10 here. Yes, certainly possible since many of us in EEB buy our first dress outfit for the interview, no? 12) Suits and sportcoats are different. I've only seen one man in a suit for an interview, several others less formally dressed, sometimes without any coat. Suit didn't get the job, but I don't think anyone cared. Almost seemed like there was an inverse correlation between experience and dressiness.","When you keep masochistically checking the jobs that already say ""interviews going out"" with the hope that some how it will change and the school will contact you... x5 :( 2) I feel this so much", ,NA,"Anon Quals Misc Identity In Anon Quals, some folks put First Gen and LGBTQ as part of their misc identity. 2) The frst-gen makes perfect sense to me. Not so sure about the LGBTQ (can't see how exactly that's relevant to the job market unless you make a point of stating it in your applications/interviews. Please forgive my ignorance and please enlighten me). 3) Why wouldn't it be appropriate for someone to list whatever they think is an important part of their identity? It's an optional cell, on an optional tab of an optional spreadsheet. Geez. 4) Hiring committees do take diversity into acocunt. There are students who identify as LGBTQ, & it may be nice for them to see faculty who also identify as LGBTQ. Inclusivity & representation are important. Alternatively: why is it important to list gender? 5) First Gen. is a confusing designation for me. Do people list that if they feel disadvantaged by their parents not having attended college? I don't feel disadvantaged by having non-college educated parents. So I guess it doesn't describe me. I'm not listing it. OP) Sorry. I forgot to finish my sentences before I post it. I wanted to ask if folks put this identity in their diversity statement or cover letter and how would search committees view it. 7) #2 here. I echo OP. That's what I meant with my question: I just don't know how it is relevant *to the application process* whether you are LGBTQI or not. Maybe I'm too idealistic and imagine a world (at least in academia) in which being straight-cis vs, LGBTQI is given the same importance in applications as playing the clarinet vs. flute, or preferring Thai food to Italian (unless you've actively done anything to include LGBTQI, which you can - and should - do irrespective of your gender identity or sexual preferences). Of course, it ain't that world yet. So: how does being LGBTQI fit into the application process? Sure it's not the same growing up gay in San Francisco or Amsterdam versus the Bible Belt or Saudi Arabia. FirstGen seemed more obvious to me as an almost unequivocal indicator of disadvantage, but #5 makes a very good point that this isn't always the case.8) I think challeneges faced by being a visible minority are in a different category than some of the other designations. One could list parent's income, being abused as a child, being from a small town, bering a parent, being first gen etc. - but they can read as reaching for a sign of adversity in SOME cases. If you have a PhD, you are extremely advantaged now, so I wonder why some people still lean really hard on their upbringing and personal life in apps.  Serious question: Do people list personal attributes in professional apps because they want to stand out as someone that could support others like themselves? Or, are people hoping to explain a deficency in their pub. record or academic history? 9) I do it to stand out as someone that could support others like myself. I'm a hispanic woman and it has been difficult to navigate academia without any mentors who share similar life experiences as me. Also LGBT+ students are more likely to abandon science majors, so it is important to have LGBT+ PIs who can offer support to LGBT+ students who may feel that there's no place for them in STEM  https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03178-5 Listing First Gen is also important because as the first in your family to pursue higher education you had to navigate college by yourself and there's challenges you had to over come to go to college, grad school, and so on, like, lack of understanding of your family on why you're spending so much time in school. Some of this challenges continue to follow you as you advace in your career. Some universities have special programs for first gen faculty. Anyways, all of this matters when it comes to offering support and being a mentor to students. The more they can relate, the better. x2 10) I added that I'm LGBT because 4 of the jobs I applied to *directly included it* in their lists of identities in their voluntary disclosure demographics page.  If some of the schools are asking about it, I think that indicates that some schools care about it. x2 11) I am gay, not obvious to most people, had to listen to faculty and peers as an undergraduate harrass and bash people who were openly gay. They said these things in front of me because I was not openly gay. LGBTQ people, especially trans people (I would argue) have a very difficult time navigating the hetero-normative lifestyle of the academic community - from faculty, staff, and students. From the perspective of an academic job, we make up a very small percentage of the pool of applicants. Many heterosexual academics face the two-body problem. Now imagine facing the two-body problem, and both of you are LGBT. You no longer feel comfortable living in rural states, so all of those jobs are out (at least in very conservative areas). Additionally, imagine if you are both men, and you want to have/adopt a kid. Many places don't offer much paternal leave (if any), so caring for a child becomes very difficult if both men are not academics. If you don't understand the disadvantages that LGBTQ people face, you possibly haven't interacted with enough LGBTQ people. x2 12) As for how I indicate it, it's in my diversity statement where I have something about how certain aspects of identity are obvious to many, but other aspects of identity like religious affiliation or certain disabilities often are not, and as a member of the LGBT community I'm aware of the mental strain it is on some students to wonder in which environments it's safe to disclose various aspects of their identity, and that this means it's on me to make it clear to students in my classes and research group that none of these aspects of identity are inherently in conflict with their roles as students and scientists.  It's not that straight cis white men from wealthy families can't be aware of these things, but that I have both the intellectual knowledge and the lived experience of navigating these decision.  A professor friend of mine currently on a search committee trying to hire 15 people over the next 3 years -- he's a computer scientist, their job market is radically different than ours -- basically said that in diversity statements he's primarily looking for evidence that candidates have even thought about diversity and inclusion when they're relatively junior and are aware of problems. He's only looking for significant actions in that realm from the more senior applicants. x2 13) Canadian universities in particular seem to be more likely to include sexual orientation and gender identity among the historically disadvantaged groups from which they encourage applications. But I also included that I was out and gay in my diversity statement where one was required/solicited, partly in order to filter out covertly-homophobic departments, partly because navigating my identity was one of the ways in which I gained an appreciation for other types of structural disadvantages, and partly because I've done some outreach/diversity work for the LGBTQ scientist community specifically. As #9 wrote, it's still not super common knowledge that LGBTQ people are more likely to drop out of STEM majors; part of the problem, I think, is that there's been almost no data on this until the last couple of years, although there has been a longer history of work linking ""minority stress"" in LGBTQ people and among people of color to, e.g., mental and physical health outcomes. Unfortunately we definitely do not live in a world yet where being LGBTQ is seen as neutrally by society as playing the clarinet vs. the flute.",NA,"Reference Letters If references are contacted when an application is submitted, and only 'complete' applications are considered. Does that typically include the reference letters?  2) Not typically. They usually give a grace period and then will contact you for missing letters later on. 3) you can always use this question as an excuse to email the search chair (just to check). At my school (a UC), one year the HR admin told us we couldn't contact a candidate who was missing a letter whom we wanted to shortlist, and that we couldn't shortlist them unless their application was complete!  Other searches since then the HR person has let us email candidates missing letters, ""reminding"" them we need their letter (i.e. so they can bug their letter-writier)"

Is there anything I need to know about it? can they say no? Can my wife work during the time until we get the green card?  2) Yes, they can say no.  Further, some ill-reputed schools will lie to you about it.  Look at the Universities to Fear website on wikia.  Even though they SHOULD follow through, unless they put it in writing within your offer letter you can't count on it.  Further, if they do say yes, and they are strapped, you may end up released prior to tenure just so they don't have to spend the cash.  Yes, that is the way many admin work.  Not all, but many. 3) they will probably offer you a H1 visa instead of a green card (permanent resident card).  The visa is cheaper for them and requires less paperwork. A lot of universities (even large ones, R1, Ivy's, 'public Ivy's, etc) will not process green cards because it's a huge investment and the faculty may eventually leave.  I think but I am not sure that the H1 visa is not as mobile as a green card, i.e., it comes with fewer benefits. 2) I agree with #3.  Still, keep your options open.

It's great that people are proud of joining new institutions and that institutions are proud of their new hires. 11) To #8: How could the AP be liable to legal action for posting the names of hired professors? It's not protected information if someone outs their new job on social media or if a name is posted on a university webpage. It's just aggregating already public information. Maybe a compromise is a view-only list to prevent haters from commenting. 12) https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/12/17965864/shitty-media-men-list-lawsuit-stephen-elliott-moira-donegan. 13) Jeremy Fox from Dynamic Ecology here. I can tell you from my experience that haphazard data on who was hired, compiled primarily from social media, is likely to be both a much smaller sample than mine, and a statistically-biased sample. For instance, new hires I learned about via social media were more likely to be women than were all new hires. So haphazardly-compiled data isn’t going to be a good guide to systemic trends in the ecology faculty job market. Also, even systematically compiling names of new hires, without any other information, isn’t going to give job seekers any useful systemic information about the ecology faculty job market as a whole. Unless I’m missing something, the main purpose of compiling names of new hires, without any other information, would be to make it easier for disappointed job seekers to satisfy their curiosity about who ended up getting hired. I leave it to others to decide if merely compiling names of new hires (haphazardly or otherwise) is worth doing; I personally don’t think it is but YMMV. Regarding the other topics that have come up in this thread, I don’t see any legal or ethical issues with compiling and publishing public information. And speaking purely personally, I agree with the suggestion not to allow any comments about anybody who was hired. 14) Maybe I'm missing something, but I feel like a list of recent hires would also be hugely valuable for people who are considering postdoc options.  Recent hires will typically have start up funds, and many of them may be more interested than established professors in taking on a postdoc, as postdocs typically generate data and papers after a shorter ramp-up period than graduate students do. 15) If so, that data already exist on blog guy's blog - in its most complete form.

NA,"contacting SC I've been thinking about my interview and have since developed a really cool idea for a project based on the meeting I had with one of the SC members. The interviews are still being conducted, but I would like to talk to the SC member about this.  Would this come off as a blatent attempt to suck up to them before they make their choice, or would it be viewed as intended: genuine interest in a project that merges her interest/specialty with mine? (1) I wouldn't do it until after I hear back from them. 2) I actually think it would be fine to contact that particular person, especially if you really hit it off with them from a research perspective. The one member is only one vote, it's not like contacting them will change the entire SC decision. Plus, if you hit it off with them, they probably already have a great opinion of you. I think if it is truly genuine interest about research you wouldn't even have to get the job to follow through. Perhaps it could be the start of a great collaboration, regardless of where you end up. You could even preface the email with something like that. You are not sucking up, you are being an interested scientist who was inspired by your conversation with another one. (3) Yeah, no reason not to. You still could pursue the idea even if you didn't end up there.
(4) OP here - after talking to some colleagues here that serve on SCs (and our dept. chair), they strongly and unanimously advised against contacting the faculty member. Their advice was that even if the intention is true, there is no way to not come off looking desperate. No one wants to vote for a desperate candidate was their opinion. Just FYI, but I still appreciated the input and comments. (5) Which, BTW, is super depressing - are the same 3 non-desperate candidates always going to come out on top?

This isn't dating (despite the superficial similarities). (7) @6.  We are certainly not all desperate.  Some folks interviewing already have positions and may be in a position to take or leave the one you are applying for.  Seeming desperate, even if you are, won't strengthen your opinion.

IMO they are useless, and the more prominent universities where I got on campus interview almost never use them.

Maybe just whether I am a weird person..... 7) My impression is that the 'more prominent universities' often skip Skype interviews because they can afford to fly out 5 candidates for campus visits anyway. The smaller colleges are more likely to do them since they may only invite 2-3 candidates and want to weed out anybody who strikes them as totally unsuitable. I agree that they don't do much unless you are obviously not a good match and in most cases I think there is a pretty good idea of who will be invited going in and that ranking might change just by a couple of spots if at all after Skype interviews.","Non-TT Teaching Jobs AP) Given that there were very few (<20) jobs posted under the Non-TT Teaching Jobs tab, I merged them into the main page for simplicity.

Some numbers: 46 applications submitted as a non resident -> 3 requests of letters from big schools. 17 applications submitted as an American resident -> 4 requests of letters, 1 phone interview, 1 skype interview. I am glad that paying about $10,000 between immigration service and lawyer was maybe worthy. 2) Congrats on your success, but I also don't think that residency status really matters all that much in letter and skype requests. I'm not even sure the search committee can see this information. Probably has more to do with your physical location than anything. 3) yes, how can they tell? It's not like you can put it in the cover letter (unless you do). 3) Here #1. Yes, I put it in both my CV and cover letter. Having earned my degree and first postdoc abroad (plus my name), my nationality is pretty obvious. As about location, I have been living in the US for almost 6 years. The main point is that I make now clear I don't need a Visa sponsorship (many schools don't have the budget to sponsor it), or maybe such numbers are just a coincidence. 4) Permenant resident status may not matter for large public or parivate schools but definately matters for many others. 5) Some places do ask in the questions you fill out online, but I would suspect SC cannot see the answers. That said, I had a campus interview for a position that could not sponsor H-1B and kicked me out of the running once they realized my status. 6) When I was not a PR, I never heard anything back from the universities that specifically request information on sponsoring H-1B or PR. In total these are about 30% of my total applications. 7) I think there are 3 paths: 1-your status is asked by HR in the preliminary questionnaire and your application doesn't go through to the SC; 2-the University potentially sponsors Visas but discourages the SC to hire foregneirs, so, your application gets through but, in doubt, it is rejected by the SC (ie, when nationality is very obvious, and PR is not). In fact, they don't want to make the big mistake to kick a candidate out of the run after invitation on-campus as #5. 3) Big schools don't care. As such, assuming the 3 kinds of schools are equally distributed in number, there is between 30 and 60% of probability of rejection more than PR/citizens. My numbers support this. I blew all my savings but hopefully it was an investment 8) Same here. At large schools & upper SLACs not anissue. Some mid and small schools it became a problem (brought up at different stages of process). Florida and South Carolina schools often had more immigration-based questions on their application (some State laws?). I recently got a Green Card, but ultimately the University didn't ask about immigration status until after the contract was signed, so it would not have been a problem. 8) Wow. So, before citizenship, you only had 3 letter requests, but after, you had 4! Wowza-wowza! Congrats for having the ability to ignore every other variable about your application, the schools to which applications were sent, etc... 9) @8, that seems rather mean spirited for this job board. If you don't have anything nice to say, put it on the Venting tab. 10) It turns out that a 6.5% hit rate is different from 23.5%. 11) Here #1. I would like to clarify that my comment was not against the American system, so it not necesary to be mean (@8 ). I uderstand there are many variables besides the budget of the school in sponsoring visas. Anyhow, 3 letters vs 4 letters are in reality 3 letters out of 46 submitted applications vs. 4 letters + 1 phone interview + 1 skype interview out of 17 submitted applications. Sample size matters. 12) to OP, is there any difference in the category of the schools which you receive requests of letters from before you received your green card and after, e.g. R1s, SLACs, PUIs? 13) @12. The first 3 letters were requested from 3 R1. After PR, 4 letters and virtual interviews from undegraduate college (1 phone interview), R1 (2 letters), R2 (1 letter, 1 skype interview), research facility (1 letter).12 again) to OP, seems like your have more diverse opportunities after your PR! 14) I think so, or maybe it is just a coincidence. Again, I would not be a PR if I didn't love this country. Don't take please my comment as a criticism towards the US. However, I would suggest foregneirs that struggle to find a position here to consider becoming a PR. I also think it shows the SC a real intention of staying in this country permanently. 15) Update: here #1: among that 17 applications recently submitted, I have received another invitation (3rd) for a phone interview. The school clearly states that they do NOT sponsor Visa. 16) As someone who is foreign and not a PR (although this is not obvious from my CV), should I be worried about having to check the box that indicates that I will require a work visa sponsorship? It was in the online application. Is it common that schools automatically disqualify candidates this why if they have not explicitly stated that that they will not sponsor visas?",NA,"Negotiating multiple interviews I just finished an on-site interview at school A--good job, but not in a place my family particularly wants to live. I found out today I got an on-site at school B in a location that would be GREAT. Location is a big deal for me and my wife. So there's a scenario that I get an offer from school A a month or more before my on-site is scheduled at school B. I probably won't be able to stall a negotiation at school A long enough to hear back at school B. I can notify school B if I get an offer from school A, but it seems unlikely they'd be able to do much on short notice if its a month before any of their scheduled on-site interviews. Any thoughts on what to do? 2) I just had the same thing happen, I had to accept school-A, because I couldn't gamble on school B making an offer. If you are secure in your current  position and can decline offer-A regardless of the other outcome, then that is certainly an option. Also, you might be surprised how long it takes a school to make an offer, get negotiations going etc., especially around the holidays. 3) If this you do get an offer from A, slow things down.  Insert a few weeks delay when scheduling a second visit.  Take time to negotiate.  And do keep B posted.  Before anyone says this is unethical, harming A's recruiting chances, etc., remember that A is ahead of schedule if you've already interviewed there.  They'll manage. 4) I was in a search committee and one of the candidates (the first one we interviewed) got an offer from another school while we were still doing on-campus interviews. The candidate notified us and everyone in the committee decided that we were not going to rush into anything. One month and a half later, we extended an offer to that candidate. I am not sure why or how (because I'm junior in my career stage and that is my only experience in a search committee) but the candidate accepted our offer and got a pretty good startup and used the other offer to negotiate with us. The negotiation part was really long and lasted months though. I would like to know how the candidate hold-off on the other offer, probably just took long to reply to each emails and maybe asked a lot of questions to gain time. 5) OP here, Thanks all, that is good advise. How common is it to have a second visit as part of the negotiation? Also, do you think I should tell the search committee of job A that I have other interviews that I'm waiting to hear about, or delay without specifiying that? 6) Doesn't seem worth it to worry about something before it has happened. People often interview for multiple jobs. Once you have an offer, then you can start figuring it out. 7) 2nd visit is a standard (at least at R1) part of interivew.  At that point, you look at space, talk to the IACUC, see if there's vivarium space for your rats, and talk to a realator about houses, etc. Negotiations sometimes break down and so a candidate has got to come back and reassess now that they're the one in the driver seat.  Also, can't hurt to tell anyone you're interviewing elsewhere.  May have no effect, or might make you seem slightly more desirable. 8) I'd take the first job if it looks good to you, and if the second job is better, pull out of the first and take the second. x2 9) Then, the job you pulled out of will be desperate enough to hire me - its really a win-win 10) Yep, people seem to get offended when I say that...but there's always someone else on the market. Don't pass up on a job that you want to spend 40 years at because you were afraid to piss off a few faculty that you will never see again. Once you land a job, it can be harder to move than it was landing that first job. If you have the chance to land your dream job in a dream location, take it. ",NA,"Interview norms in Europe (Nordic) Can anyone provide insight into how to interview for Assoc. Prof jobs in Europe. I just got invited for a job in Norway (this is not news to anyone else who applied because the entire process is completely transparent to all that applied; I.e. we got a list of all applicants and the committee's ranking, weird at first, but super refreshing, actually). But now, I've been called to fly half way around the world for a 3 hour interview. Really? Give a lecture, 90 minute interview, and find lunch on your own. Seems weird. So dress code? How to prepare, etc. Thanks for the tips! (I'm pretty excited about this, can you tell?) 2) The process is different in each country in Europe. I had an interview in Norway, which I thought was just a lecture, panel interview, and dinner afterwards with another candidate. In fact, there were lots of informal conversations inbetween, so the whole thing lasted maybe 10 hours. Nothing remotely equivalent to a chalk talk was requested. Scandinavians don't dress especially formally at work. From what I'd seen previouly while visiting the favored color palette for women seems to be black and grey, so I went with that and skipped the heels in favor of a pair of flat boots. The other (internal) candidate was wearing everyday clothes. They were very interested in fit to the department and how I'd interact with other's research, but it might depend on how small they are. They ended up cancelling the position for some reason in the end. 3) I worked at the University of Oslo for a year. Dress code is for 'formal' events (dissertation defense etc.) is very similar to the US. Its a beautiful country, I wish you luck! 4) Don't want to break the Law of Jante though. When I lived in Sweden, PhD defenses were a huge deal, so I'm not sure I'd apply that as the standard. I'd say the kind of outfit you'd see on someone interviewing for an East Coast Med school would be a touch too stuffy."
NA,"Phone interview content? Just got a request for a phone interview. Thus far I have only had an on campus interview (which seems like a joy compared to what I would imagine a phone interview might be like). Anyone out there willing to share their phone interview experience--for example, what kinds of questions do they ask, do they give you a chance to ask questions, too, is there anyway it can not be completely awkward? 1) From my experience you'll get a set of question (5 or 6) that will be asked to every candidate and you get a chance to ask questions after. Read the materials available in the ""helpful links & tips"" for sample questions. I found this to be very helpful. 
2) Think about what you are saying, and don't keep yapping on and on. From my experience, the hardest part of a phone interview is to know when to stop talking because you can't see anyone and assess if you answered their question satisfactorly. Good luck!
3) I agree with #2 above. Also, talk to colleagues who have either partaken in them, or are part of the search committee doing them. I was lucky in that the department I postdoc in does phone interviews and they gave me copies of all the questions in their database they ask applicants. The school I was applying to is very similar, so this was helpful. However, I found it hard to not get caught up in trying to relate a novel question to one I've seen before. Never forget to answer just using your abilities, not a preconceived answer from a related question. For mine, I had 6 questions on teaching, 6 questions on research, and 6 questions on service, then I was allowed to ask questions. I only asked 4-5 so that I didn't take up too much of their time. You want to ask questions that demonstrates you are a savvy vet, but really, most of the details can be gleaned during the campus interview if you get that far. Good luck!
4) It seems sort of stupid, but one of the things I wish someone had told me is that the phone seems to disconnect every time you speak because of how the conference call/speakerphone works. It was disconcerting (at least for me) to hear a click followed by dead silence during one of the most important phone calls of my life. And it happened every time I spoke. Try not to panic and scream ""Hello? Hello?"" into the phone mid-answer. I didn't do that, but it was closer than I'd like to admit ;) Since my first interview, several people I've spoken to have agreed with how much that sucks, especially the long moment of silence between you stopping and them starting to speak again (maybe they really did hang up?!?!), but I just wish someone would have thought to warn me. Congrats and good luck on the interview, by the way! 5) OP here, thanks so much for the advice everyone! 6) i had a ""phone"" interview via skype video this year and thought it was a great medium for a ""phone"" interview. I think all SCs should start using skype video. 7) OP again here, I agree about skype! Also, for those of you who might be willing, when you say they asked you questions about your research, would you say they were general questions, like ""Describe what your main research interests are in your own words, blah, blah, blah"" or more specific, like ""In this paper you hypothesized this..."" Similarly, I once heard someone say that they were asked to describe how they would teach a very specific course. Did you have this type of experience, or were the teaching questions more general? Thanks! 8) I've had both general and specific teaching questions depending on the needs of the dept.  Specific for the class they want/need taught (if any) and general about courses/seminars I could develop.  Research has been more general, especially on the phone.  Probably the most specific was ""what kind of project could you involve an undergrad on and how quickly could that happen once you're here?""  9) I would be very surprised if anyone asked you to talk that specifically about your past research in a phone interview, #7. Admittedly, I've only been phone-interviewed by schools that are more teaching oriented, but I still think the purpose of your phone interview is to gauge your general interests, abilities, and potential fit in the department. In one of my phone interviews, they did ask me very specifically about how I might structure a particular class, if I was asked to teach it. I must admit, I wasn't really prepared to answer something so specific. 10) I got asked about specific research items.  Not specific hypotheses (not defense type questions) but about specific models, how implemented, how the department would benefit from my skills, etc.  But it was a pretty quantitative/modeling related post.  But if you are selling any unique analytical skills, I would be prepared to talk about them in detail (although may not get the question).",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2015-2016 Wiki 1) I've got some postdoc openings in my lab coming up.  Where to advertise?  Ecolog, evoldir, anywhere else? 2) Here: http://sites.biology.duke.edu/jackson/ecophys/postdoc.html",NA,NA,NA,"Pregnant for interview season? I'm going to be 8-9 mos pregnant in February, which was prime interview season last year. If I did get an interview for late Feb I wouldn't be able to travel, but presumably the committee would still have to give me some kind of equal consideration? In actual practice I just don't see how this can work. This happened to a colleague last year, so not purely hypothetical (spoiler: she didn't get  the job). Wondering what kind of pre-emptive actions I should take, if any. I got 4 interviews last year, so I'm hoping to at least get a few this year. 2) As an SC member, I think this would warrant mentioning to the SC chair once you get to the phone inetrview stage.  Late Feb would be pretty late for most interviews, so hopefully you'll be OK, but I think you'll want to mention it as early as possible, which means once you know you're on some sort of short list or phone interview list.  Any good SC Chair will try to accomodate you and make sure that you're not at a disadvantage. 3) OP--thanks for your insight! 4) I think #2 might be a little too optimistic about the entire pool of people on search committees (though I wish we lived in a world where you were right!). I think I would wait to mention it until you had a campus interview scheduled. You can't help if people have biases, but you might as well wait to give them that information until you need to (but still with enough time for them to make reasonable accomodations). 5) Agree with 4 - control your information to give yourself the greatest advantage. Don't let them know until it's absolutely necessary. (And congratulations.) 6) I know someone who interviewed for a job when she was 8.5 months pregnant. Her husband drove her 10+ hours each way to the interview b/c her doctor didn't want her flying. Not sure if that would be an option for you & any of the places you've applied, but it's worth considering if the timing ends up being bad. She got the job, btw. 7) All good info. I will wait until when/if on campus is scheduled I think. 8) What an amazing spouse!  9) SC most certainly is supposed to give you equal consideration.  I've seen searches that for various reasons had a gap between interviews (worst was an interview split on either side of winter break).  If you feel comfortable, I suggest telling SC chair as early as feasible (if it looks like you are a strong contender, e.g. phone interview).  You can't gurantee that they will follow the rules, but I would hope that most would.  Knowing that you have a constraint on when you can interview that requires reasonable accomodation would be helpful for the SC to know as early as possible. 10) I disagree with those saying you have a responsibility to inform the SC. Wait until you are offered the interview. (Context - multiple x SC member, 1 x SC chair. Parent.) x2  11) No one said anyone had a ""responsibility"" to let the SC chair know, just that it was a suggestion for how to make things work out as well as possible. 12) #10 here. Ok, fair enough. Then let me rephrase that and say that I don't think you should inform the SC until a campus interview has been offered (and I'm assuming it becomes necessary to mention then only because it may affect scheduling). Think about it this way. Something that SCs are often concerned about, particularly at 2nd tier institutions, is that the search will fail. Generally lots of good candidates apply so this tends to happen most often when the top candidate or candidates has/have multiple offers & take too long to decide. Thus the SC & chair, for better or worse, will often end up being overly concerned about any factor that will delay evaluation of the candidates. If you give them this information up front - even though they are probably not allowed to permit it to influence their decision making - there is a chance that it could consciously or subconsciously negatively affect the chances that you will be offered an interview, primarily over concerns that your pregnancy could delay the entire search process and thus increase the chances of failure of the search. Interviews, once offered, generally can't be retracted - or at least it is much more difficult. They certainly cannot be retracted at my institution due to pregnancy. Thus, I would strongly suggest that you not bring this up until the interview offer is in hand - and only then if it needs to be raised due to the timing of the interview. Just my two cents :)","It's been years since this page has been hit by trolls, but the 'any updates' person is in all likelihood a troll. There's no apparent pattern to the type of job they are inquiring about everything from chair to asst prof 2) not necessarily trolls and not necessarily just one person. I think it's several people thinking that by doing so they will get some information. We can ask them directly: ""Any updates?"" people, what's your motivation? 3) I dunno - there's 50 or so from yesterday. 4) Maybe a single person really really really wants to know any updates to the jobs they applied for. 5) I wonder if the 50 or so from yesterday were in response to someone venting about 'any updates'? 5) So any updates on the ""any updates person""? 6) that last comment made me chuckle. As a person that just asked ""any updates?"" on a position, I can say it is because I genuinely want to know and desperately want that particular job. 7) about 500 other people desparately want that job, too 8) #7 yes I know, but so do I.  9) Some folks are willing to share updates they've got, such as interview, rejection, letter request, etc; some aren't. ""Any updates"" is just a general request to get some sort of information.","re-apply when search failed Last year I applied for a few jobs, which search failed. I was not considered at all. My application now is very different and I am still interested in that positions. Would you apply for that jobs again? 2) I would! The SC is likely at least partly new folks x3 3) I did this last year and ended up with an on-site. You can be reasonably optimistic if you've demonstrably added experience/pubs/grants 4) I know someone who didnt get an interview in the first round of a posting; after the search failed he applied again the next year and got the job. Definitely do it.  5) If you weren't considered at all, it's quite likely no one will remember your CV or know that it's your second time applying. 6) Do it. I scored on such an attempt. ",NA,"number of references I am going to have my first on campus interview in the U.S. in a few weeks and I am quite scared by the chalk-talk.  Any particular suggestion/recommendation? I will definitely have mock/practice chalk-talks in the next weeks.1) Prepare handout/notes. This way you don't have to reply too much on the board. Make sure you prepare i) a rough outline of an NSF/NIH grant that you will start writing when you get the position, ii) syllabus (or list of topics) for the course that you propose to teach. This way, the SC will know that you will hit the ground running when you start. Also, being prepared really impresses people.   2) Different schools want to see different things.  Ask the SC how much (if at all) they want to hear about courses you'll teach during the chalk talk.  Do they want a big picture overview of the general research topic?  Or do you need to be prepared to defend specific aims of grants and how you'll get the methods to work?  Remember that part of their job is to dig in to see how much you know.  A bad chalk talk has zero questions.  3) this may seem naive but is a chalk talk different than a job talk? 4) https://sociobiology.wordpress.com/2016/10/11/chalk-talks-how-to-avoid-10-pitfalls/ 5) #3 same here - I don't really understand what a chalk-talk is compared to a regular job talk. 5) @3- Yes!! Very different!!! You are supposed to lay out your plans for the future.  Many schools in the US want a brief overview of 2-3 grants you could submit on your work. If you can show how it would fit with that school, even better.   You may also be asked to comment on how you would structure a course related to your field.  What is your teaching philosophy?  How big do you want your lab to be?  How would you structure your group to make sure students get proper training?   Often it's a smaller group than the job talk.  If your advisor hasn't explained this to you, that is a serious error on their part. 6) A serious error? If you are asked to give a chalk talk as OP has, then you (obviously) want to listen to the advice here. That said, I've had a dozen or so on-campus interviews over the years and not once have I been asked to give one. 7) All the above, plus: practice the layout of your chalk talk on a board with other folks - your organization matters. I took pictures of my final white board and took those with me. Bring your own markers, especially if you want to use colors to separate things out. Prepare to be interrupted. Have concrete ideas in mind for where you will submit grants, and think about how you might diversify your funding sources (especially given new NSF PI limits). 8) OP here! Thanks!! It will be an interview for a developmental/evolutionary genomics position in a medical school Dept in R1 Uni.  Teaching load is very low (one course per year shared with another Faculty). I will try to ask and understand whether they expect me to discuss also teaching in the chalk talk.  9) I'm faculty at an R1. A chalk talk is basically used to assess if you have an independent research program that could form the basis of grant applications. The best chalk talks lay out two potential grants (maybe one NSF and one NIH, or for more ecology maybe one NSF and one USDA, etc).  Briefly mention how the two grants are different and will make-up two areas of future research in your lab. Then I would suggest focussing on one, and diving further in, laying out three main aims, and the research involved. Mention how you will involve graduate/undergraduate students in the research. I also encourage you to mention the tools and techniques you will use (particularly if this integrates and draws on expertise at the institution you're interviewing at). The chalk talk is really important. In my experience, almost all candidates have top-notch research talks prepared, and the chalk-talk is where one candidate will usually distinguish themselves as superior (or more likely, at least 2 candidates will blow it, and seem like they haven't really thought out future research plans). 10) OP again: thanks #9! So you would mention 2 grants, but only go into details for 1, correct?  11) #9 here again -- briefly outlining 2 grants, and detailing 1, is general advice given time constraints and the balance between showing you know both the details and have broad scope. But it depends on the kind of research you do. Basically, you want to demonstrate that you're thinking big and long term, and able to picture a research PROGRAM (ie. not just a research PROJECT), and have the knowledge of the specifics to pull it off. 12) I'd add that it's a good idea to be prepared for this question related to future grants even if you aren't asked to do a chalk talk. This is a common question that committees ask in the on-campus meeting with the candidate, and they sometimes expect a high level of detail. 13) #3 here again - has anyone every had to give a chalk talk outside of an R1 or R2 interview? 14) I did one at a masters level school, but it was more informal than the ones I've seen at the R1 where I am a postdoc. I don't like the format and honestly don't think it is the best way to judge the vision for someones research program (grants aren't awarded based on an oral presentation with interruptions). I have to say that I've seen 10+ of them at R1 over the last 2-3 years and only 1-2 have been very good with a few more OK and the majority not good (despite the fact that nearly all those candidates gave very good research talks). At least where I am, candidates get interrupted a LOT and taken off on various hypothetical paths that aren't directly related to the grant outlines that they come in prepared to talk about. I guess department culture probably varies a lot on that. 15) I fucking *hate* chalk talks. Most people can't have an open-ended ""chat"" about research ideas under the intense interview conditions. Don't pretend that they should be able to, or that if they can't then they suck. Let candidates prepare research seminars that they can do a good job at, and leave it at that. Someone's improv skills in a chalk talk setting do not necessarily translate into them being a good researcher, so I don't understand what they point is. 16) The point is power. It's the same reason fraternities and sororities haze pledges, the same reason your PhD committee grills you, the same reason there is so much police brutality: power and dominance grows when unchecked. If you display the same alpha power when you are hazed, while signaling submission when it counts, you can then become one of the aggressors of the pathetic department fiefdom 17) that previous comment is ludicrous. The point is that many trainees receive good training/feedback on research presentations, so they give good presentations but are not thinking for themselves. The Chalk Talk differentiates those candidates who were just trained well to give talks from those who are spearheading their own research/ideas. 18) @17, I agree that 16 is over the top, but I completely disagree. Asking people to defend their ideas against interruptions and agressive questions (most chalk talks I've seen) is entirely different from having them demonstrate that they are spearheading their own research/ideas. The latter is demonstrated by publications and succesful grants, which never involve an oral defense against an antagonistic audience (you may say the audience shouldn't be antagonistic, but I've been to a bunch of chalk talks at R1s and they were nearly always moderately to very antagonistic). In my mind this is just another way that particular personality types are selected for in academic hiring that have little to do with actual performance as a teacher or researcher or contributor to a department. I think the charitable perspective from a committee perspective is that the top candidates are very hard to separate when they all have stellar CVs and (most) give excellent research seminars. The chalk talk feels like an objective thing to make a decision on because the performance is often more clearly variable and it is pretty obvious that some people do really well and others do really poorly, so the committee can be happy that they've evaluated performance, but as I said above the performance here has little to do with performance on the actual job. You could pretty clearly separate candidates by asking them to perform circus tricks, but no one would suggest that (for the literalistist on here, I do realize that the chalk talk is closer to being job related than circus tricks, but you get the point). 19) I'm new to chalk talks - never given one or even seen one (not a part of the institutions I've been at), and I'm wondering what the strategy should be for existing grants. I just had a grant awarded, and this will obviously be a big part of my research program in the next few years. How much time should I spend on this already funded project vs. outlining ideas for new grants?",NA,"Interview fail :) 1) Thought it would be fun to share this: I completed a Zoom interview without my camera being on. Oops! And the committee didn't say anything about not being able to see me! 2) Not a big deal, my dept just did a search and we let candidates choose between video and no-video. I think it's more fair, honestly, to do it with no video, this prevents bias based on visual factors "
NA,"Salaries What's the going rate (salary) for ecologists (starting assistant profs) at R1's and R2's these days? (1) Check the negotiations pages. For specific schools, check the salary survey on the links page. This gives average salaries for assisant, associate, and full profs.

(2) Don't forget to look at the State Salary Database at http://wikifoia.pbworks.com/State%20Salary%20Database

3) Also, chronicle of higher education has self-reported salaries for all universities, only up through 08-09, but still helpful-- http://chronicle.com/stats/aaup/

4) Here's what I did. I went back and looked at salaries for asst. prof. at the place I was interviewing dating back to 1999. The most recent data are for 2008-2009. I ran a regression through these years (R^2 = 0.998xx) to calculate what salaries *should be* for 2010-2011 (my first year). This number reflects assitant profs who have been there a couple of years. So if you can get your offer up to this number for your institution, you should be very happy. You'd be getting paid in your first year what most are making in their 2-4th year. (5) Thanks, I'm going to try that. Do you mind sharing what you came up with? 

6) @5 - it's institution specific (based on what their salaries were from the AAUP database at chronicle.com
7) Not 5, we realize it's institution based, but would you share to get a feel for the range (if others would share as well)?

8) #4 & #6 here - I'm willing to share things that are helpful to others, but I guess I'm not sure what value sharing institution-specific information would gain. First, I haven't heard back if I have the offer or not, so I don't have a specific number from them. I've only done the regression to be prepared for what to expect. But second, I could spit out any number between $50-80K but it would be meaningless. $70K in CA is a lot different than $70K in KS. Or even look at just within cities that have numerous universities (e.g., Boston, LA), granted they are not all R1 and R2, but there is substantial variation among the pay grades even within the same city/area. My data would be uninformative; my suggestion would be to pick the R1/R2 you are interested in and then a handful of others that are comparable in research activity, run regressions for each, then develop your own range. That would be a lot more informative than just one number from one person from one undisclosed location/school. 

9) You're right #8, keep your precious regression result and data to yourself. 
10) Do you not understand that #8 is not being proprietary? It is just the number are only meaningful for that particular institution and not for all. All of the data on average wages are available by university in Chronicle. You can replicate this for yourself for your institution - I doubt #8 has time time to run the regression for all universities. 

11) I think most people here get your point #8 and #10, even #9. Is there a database for biology salaries? Salaries for starting profs (assistant profs) not only vary greatly from institution and region but they also vary great between disciplines. The starting salary for an English Lit prof will probably be much lower than a Business Admin or Engineering assistant prof position at the same school (R1). I think what the OP was getting at is a range for biologists, particularly ecologists. To my knowledge, the common databases don't provide discipline specific salaries. Does anyone here know of any such sites? 12) If the state is an open records state, and the uni is a state institution, you can google employee compensation and get the actual salaries of people, usually from the year before, online. I only found this out because a candidate for a TT position at another sister institution to mine mentioned that he actually knew my salary. At first I was a little ""weirded out"" about this, but then I realized that it is a powerful tool - if you can find it - for negotiating a reasonable salary, so long as the state publishes the records.

13) #8 (&4) here - oh, holy crap. Thank you #10 for being reasonable. For the record, the salary I came up with is $71,926 using the equation y = -4423410.811+(2236.486*x), where x = start year. Was that helpful?

14) Give him/her a break and do a little work on your own. The regressions are specfic to the institutions that THEY applied to ...not yours...not everyone.  For a list of salaries at most institutions go to:  http://chronicle.com/article/Searchable-Database-AAUP/64231/   and do your own ""precious regression""  Jeez, I hope you show more initiative if you ever get an interview!

A 3 pager with images is about the same as a 2 pager, but you can count on someone on the search committee dismissing an application because they didn't follow instructinos.  So these places require more time to edit your docment that they may end up only reading for about 10 seconds. 2) Agreed, could either cut out a section to trim to 2 pages or cut out a figure. I probably will cut out the figure for the 2 page docs.  3) With only two pages some people criticize figures as a waste of space.   The truth is different people want to see different things and everyone will give you different formatting advice.  Pick one and hope someone on the committee is reasonable enough to get past that kind of garbage. 4) I cut the figure, which is also in one of my published papers, and add ""See fig 2 in XX et al, 2017"". Its my bet-heding strategy. Acklowledge a figure *should* be there......but isnt. 5) That is a good idea #4, but the figures I have in my normal research statement are all from unpublished data since I figure they 'could' look at published figures already. 6) #5, To be honest, search committee members will have to go through hundreds of research statements so telling them to ""look"" for a figure in your paper, I think it would not likely happen. On the other hand, if you can articulate clearly your research using one good figure and in under two pages, I think it would be a positive for the committee. When I see a six page research statement, I don't see a productive candidate, I see a candidate who do not know how to explain their research clearly. x2 5) Yeah I've never referred to figures outside of my statement, but I see how it could be a way around annoying differences in page limits. I've generall used unpublished figures because I've taken the strategy of trying to talk more about my new/future work and the unpublished figures are just a better representation of those directions. 7) You all have figures in your research statements? I've never heard of t hat among my field, interesting.  8) I've been on hiring committees and have seen figures in the applicants' research statements.  I guess they kind of make your application ""pop"" in a way, so that it's not just page after page of text, but the figures mostly seem like a waste of space to me, to be honest.  I've never seen much value in them.  Maybe different if you have some preliminary results to show?  9) My take on it, after searching on committee and proposal review panels is that if you have just text, I won't read it. Yes, I'm harsh. but tealize that not everyone has the same learning style as you, even faculty. Some may not want to read solid text and would like figures to help them understand the overall point. Committee members have other things going on in their lives besides your application.  400 job applications, 2-4 pages of research statement = 800-1600 pages. Who has time for that?  10) +1 here to what #9 said. Occasionally a job app has a killer figure in the research statement that cleanly summarizes the person's work in about half a page, and I think to myself, this person has what it takes to get a real competitive grant.  Good figures are a huge boost to your research, in your papers, job apps, and grant proposals. 11) - #7 here. Maybe it's just specific to my field, but research statements shouldn't ever be more than 2 pages and if there are figures in them the impression is you probably don't have that much to say. Not saying it's right, it's just what seems to be standard for us (or at least among the dozen or so succesful applications I've seen, including my own) 12) #11, what subfield is that? Almost every successful app I've seen from people that got jobs in the last ~5 years have had 3 page or even 4 page research statements and probably 50% had a couple of figures. If you're really limited to two pages I see having no room to fit a figure in, but 3-4 pages of solid text is a lot to read (as #9 says).  13) Ha, ""learning styles"" are a myth.   14) If you're not going to read the fucking apps, you shouldn't be on a search committee.  Get over yourself.  You're probably passing on good colleagues over an unspecified formatting requirement.  I bet Uni HR would have a huge fucking problem with that. (x2) 15) That escal*at*ed quickly! 16) Well, it's the venting tab and it's also desperation season, I think a few ""fuckings"" are understandable. 17) @14 no I'm not going to read the apps, other than the CV and cover letter.  The search is about us, not you... (faculty troll here, rawr!) 18) Narcissists in academia are such fun - all about us, too lazy to read, whines about reading being too much work. x2  19) I love people who think their convenience is more important than fair hiring practices and university liability.  Defintely, hire the Prof who gets your school sued over the one that thought you could read something besides picture books.  https://media.giphy.com/media/oFPiPgqwof4Pe/giphy.gif 20) 17 here agin, ehh, I got a preferred candidate anyway. I just gotta get the rest of the committee to see it my way. 21) #14 yes HR have something to say about it. It's HR who insist that we are not allowed to consider applicants who do not follow the applicatiin guidelines. 22) <- Do you not know what ""unspecified"" means? Reading comprehension issues.","Landing a new tenure track job when you already have one Are there any people here who already have tenure track jobs, not tenured yet yet are on the market looking for something better, say a better institution with better infrastructure, collaborative opportunities, etc? You finding it hard or easy to get interviews? 2) Can't speak for myself, but some schools tend to disproportionately draw interviewees who are already assistant profs elsewhere. 3) Also curious about this, and whether places end up hiring the already-profs or the postdocs from mixed interview pool 4) I am in year 5 of a TT position. Am up for tenure next year and will almost certainly get it. I like my colleagues and students. Just not particulary happy with the geographic location where I live. So I'm selectively applying to a handful of places. I would say my only advantage is that I have a ton of teaching experience. My research has suffered a bit over the past 5 years though (only published 3 papers in past 5 years, with two more in prep). 5) @3: It varies widely. The frequencies of APs turning down offers are much higher than postdocs, since they can use offers as bargaining chips. But I also think APs have a more proven record of pulling in grant $$$ and so are more likely to get offers at high-ranking R1s. 6) Interesting because I'm in year 4, have a major federal grant and may get another one, but am 'stuck' at a teaching focused institution and have had little traction in my applications, even though I should be fairly competitive. x2 7) I'm in the same boat as 6. Federal grant (individual I might add), prospects for another, great (or at least v. good) teaching evals, but no bites. Guess I'm yesterday news in favor of someone totally untested. 8) Maybe they figure that if you'd leave one TT job to apply for theirs, the same might happen to then a few years down the line... 9) 7 here, @8, my indirects have back-filled my startup and I've taught a full load for my time here...isn't that the most any dept. can hope for?  10) Shit, when I was still an assistant prof, I was always getting short-listed.  As a tenured associate prof, I've seen my advancement in job searches completely bottom out.11) Awesome. I'm not alone. x2 12) https://chroniclevitae.com/news/776-how-do-i-pitch-myself-for-associate-professor-positions has some tips. 12) The year I completely re-worked my job app materials, in year 3 of being an AP I got one phone interview (didn't advance) and one on-campus interview, which resulted in an offer I accepted.  The 'fit' was extremely good so I don't know how much influence my previous faculty position had.  But TBH I had been using similar job materials for years, just tweaking them for each position and updating with current research, and I think the language had gotten stale.",NA,"the wait What is the typical wait time at most SLACs after the final candidate goes to the campus visit? Any insights? yes, I am anxious. 2) I did 2 SLAC interviews in early-mid Nov and got offers from both, one last week and one early this week. I was first candidate on campus at both and thanksgiving was in the middle, but that gives some idea of timeframe. 3) @OP, I feel you on the anxiousness bit. I have to constantly intervene with myself not to contact the search chair. It's like trying not to be too overeager when meeting someone we think is great (telling myself to ""act normal, don't talk too much about salamanders""). Did you ask the chair for a timeline? If not, I don't think it is out of line to gently prod for one. I've generally tried to get a rough feel for timelines everywhere I've interviewed so far. I generally approach it as asking for a ""rough"" timeline so as not to make it feel like I'm trying to hold them to a particular date. 3) just to clarify - I don't really think you could talk too much about salamanders... 4) I hear you, OP!! Waiting to hear from one as well. My impression is that wait time is school specific--I know of one SLAC where the wait time was ~1-2 days after the last interviewer and others where it took 2-3 weeks for the top candidate. It would be helpful if search chairs let us know when the first offer went out, but I understand why they don't always do that...Hang in there! 4) At my school, we hold a faculty meeting 1 to 2 days after the last interviewee departs from campus. At this meeting we decide the candidate order and that order is sent to HR. HR usually takes 3-5 business days to approve our order and give us permission to contact the top candidate. Once the first candidate is contacted, negotiations usually take about 5-10 business days if the candidate is interested in the job, sometimes longer. Candidates that are not serious (e.g., have taken another job, want wayyyy more money than what was offered, etc...) are usually passed over in 1-2 business days. Once a candidate is passed over, we have to contact HR and let them know why the candidate was not hired and ask permission to contact the second on the list (usually takes 1 to 2 business days for this approval). This process continues until our campus interviewee list is depleeted. If none of the campus interviewees take the job, we can then ask permission from HR to bring in more candidates in the order that they were ranked after phone interviews, and the process starts over. Basically, the timelines will vary greatly between schools and also vary greatly between searches. ",NA,"Applicant diversity 1) Our department has historically done very well with gender balance.   In our most recent comp bio search applicants do not reflect the gender or ethnic diversity of the field.  We have advertised at organizations that target minorities and women.  We also have standard HR language in the ad about supportive environments.  We have no recent scandals or bad actors that I know of.  I'm concerned about why we have so few women and minorities in the applicant pool.   If anyone has suggestions about factors that can increase applications, I'd appreciate your thoughts. 2) General location? I've noticed the same thing too. I personally feel that the current political climate has resulted in a lot of candidates focusing on more progressive cities. I don't blame them if this is in fact true. 3) I'm a WOC and I'm doing what #2 just said 4) Yeah that's been our reality here too. And we're in a large city. The pool is small. There are no easy solutions and haven't been for years. 5) How was the wording on the job ad? Depending on how specific you were with qualifications, I can see applicants thinking that they would not qualify to apply. The more general the ad, the bigger the applicant pool (in general). 6) Im trans, I have not been restricting my search to 'liberal' places. Im actually preferably looking for something more rural. But I am likley an outlier.  1) Our state is not known to be progressive, but the city is.  I hadn't thought the broader political climate could reach so far, but I think you are right to point out that it could.  7) I think #5 might be right too, people may feel not qualified to apply for very specific jobs even if they are  1) Apply for everything!!!! 5) You can say to apply for everything, but there isn't time. You asked for advice on how to get a bigger pool, and I provided a suggestion. It's disheartening that you immediately decide it must be some external factor like location rather than reflect on your job ad's wording. 8) Does/did your ad have a deadline? The reality is that the ones that don't often get pushed down my piiority list, since I just don't have that much time and there are other things I can't just drop.  1) @5, I didn't say it was all because of location.  Only that was an aspect I had not considered before 2 suggested it.  I'm listening to the other comments. 9) I'm white, but my husband (and kids) are Latino, so I restrict my applications to liberal states where I think they'll face less discrimination. "
NA,"Search Chair comments Because the anticipation is driving me batty, I'd love to hear speculation from everyone else. If you are the first candidate and a SC Chair tells you that she'll call with the offer immediately after the first faculty meeting after the last candidate, how do you interpret this? Essentially, I now know the day I should get a call if I am the top candidate. If I don't get the call on that date, well then I know it wasn't me. If I were a chair, I wouldn't want to alienate a potential runner-up by letting her/him know they weren't the first choice (in the eWhine the top candidate declines). What's your take on this? Is this an indication I'm their top choice, or did the SC chair screw up by telling me this, or is it a neutral statement?  This is all just for ****s & giggles, but curious what others think. (1) I totally hear ya. I'm in the same boat. I've been agonizing over every little comment the SC made during my interview. I got the impression that I was their top candidate. But, in reality there's no telling. They probably say the same kind of things to all the interviewees. I'ts driving me insane!  There seem to be plenty of SC people on this wiki though. Maybe they can share some insight. blah. (2) I'm a lurking spouse of someone going through the job search. One SC committee head went so far as to write in a post-interview e-mail ""Look forward to seeing you soon"" - totally leading us to believe there would be a job offer and a subsequent 2nd visit to campus. That was 6 weeks ago, and offers were supposed to be made right after the holidays. Either my spouse was #1 with the SC and the dean overruled, or the SC head was really (unfairly, IMO) blowing smoke. 3) I have had a very similar experience. I was even told by the chair that I should be expecting a call from him or the dean in three weeks! After not hearing from them for a month, I finally emailed them and asked (in a very friendly and enthusiastic way) where they might be in the process. After another agonizing week, I got an email back saying they were slogging through administrative blah, blah, blah and the faculty would be meeting on a specific date AND they were very hopeful that I would hold on, they were very impressed with me, etc. Well, that date came and went nearly a month ago now, and I again haven't heard from them. In the meantime, I've talked to all sorts of people about what could be going on and have been told that all kinds of things could be at play 1) the obvious, they have made another offer and are going through negotiations with that person and waiting to tell others until that is finalized 2) they have lost funding for the position and are trying to work something out 3) they are still dealing with admin snags, apparently SC recommendations have to go through the dean and sometimes other admin people before offers are made (which can take forever). So, while I'm still not sure what the outcome will be (and I think they all handle all this stuff extremely poorly), I do believe that we just never know what is going on and it is probably best not to jump to conclusions. Also, when we don't hear back after a great interview, we start feeling like the entire thing was all just bullsh*&t, but this experience has made me realize that that is probably not the case--no matter how much the SC liked us, there are a lot of other things that can go into making the final decision.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Accepting a tt position after accepting a postdoc 18) As a Christian evolutionary biologist, I think it's extremely important to have people like us in the field. I attended a college very much like Pepperdine and it had a very strong, scienctifically-sound biology program where professors led students to maintain their faith in God while still learning all the same evolutionary biology stuff that they would have learned at a secular school. Personally, I don't feel there is any conflict between my belief that God created the world and the idea that species may adapt and change over time to better fit their environments. That may seem like an oversimplification of things to some people, but if we can believe that God is the creator of all is it really such a stretch to believe He created a world with mechanisms like evolution in it? The Bible isn't a science book, it's an ancient story of how God redeemed His people. Also, God charged us to be stewards of creation, and what better way to do that than by studying its mysteries? A really informative book on this topic is Not Just Science, I recommend it! 19) Religion is social science and has no place in a science classroom. Period. 20)  Religion is a social science? Really? 21)  ""Evolutionary biology stuff?""  THAT is precisely the problem.  20) Yes, Religion is part of social studies, under anthropology.  Although, it is somtimes in the liberal arts or humanities.  Religion is also housed under theology, and might be in its own section for that purpose, but otherwise again its social science or humanity.  http://rel.as.ua.edu/pdf/rel100introhandout.pdf, https://rlst.colorado.edu/academic-study-of-religion 22) Yes, no matter how you feel about it, religion is a human behavior and the only way it could be included in the sciences is in studies of human behavior and maybe physiology. As an athiest, I don't really care what people choose to believe, but please don't confuse it with science or infuse science with it.  23) I am post 19 and 20. You don't have to be athiest to want religion out of a science classroom.  24) Wait - ""species may adapt and change over time to better fit their environments"" - please tell me you are not acknowledging microevolution and sweeping everything else under the rug... 25) I'm #18 and no, I'm not ""sweeping everything under the rug,"" I just didn't see the need to write an entire treatise on evolution in this space. I was specifically responding to the question posed by #17 (which I note has been deleted), which was about whether or not he/she would want to teach evolutionary biology at a Christian school. My opinion is that scientifically-sound evolutionary biology can be, should be, and is taught at [some] Christian schools. We read all the same textbooks and classic papers and upon my arrival at a highly competitive secular graduate department I was completely up to speed with the rest of my cohort. Religious instruction was not a part of my biology classes but they were taught by Christian leaders who I looked up to as mentors and role models and who were always available to discuss potential conflicts between their students' faiths and their science education after hours. I don't see how nit-picking the phrasing I used in a chatroom-type setting has any relevance to the discussion.  26) I'm the first #20; not that it really matters, but religion shouldn't be considered a social science.  If you do that, you may as well lump English literature in that fold.  I have great respect for the humanities, but unlike social or natural science religion and literature lacks falsafiability.  19) Religion as an academic field is either social science or a humanity.  It doen't matter what you think should be, it is what it is.  It is part of human culture.  BELIEF in a religion lacks falsafiability, but asking questions about a religion and the people who follow it does not.  Further, literature does not lack falsifiability either.  Of course, if you believe The talking spider in Charlottes Web is a real talking being, that might lack falsifiabiity.  :)  I should also clarify, this has nothign to do with secular schools.  It has to do with confusing principals of academic fields.  You can teach an entire course on the philosophy of the southern baptists, catholism, Judeism, or Islam, and teaching science has no place in those classes either.  Its a mutually exclusive.  Science in a science classroom, religion in a religion classroom.  Religious TRAINING however is something entirely different and has no place in either area except that trainees may take the courses.  There can be SOME science discussed as pertinent to a religioin.  For example, a flat earth creationist might state that the science says A but we believe B.  Likewise, it is perfectly fine for a scientist to state some religious folks believe B, but the science shows A.  Acknowledgement is not necessary by either group however.  But that is not what happens.  I taught in a public southern school where we were told not to teach evolution..state univeresity too!  I also taught at a Methodist and a baptist school, each never once expected me to do a darn thing regarding religion.  However, I also have taken a grade school class from a baptist preacher who regularly preached in the classroom, a public school.  I have taught at a public school where the methodist professor regularly preached his religion in the science classroom.  These people are dishonest.  Truth is not fact and fact is not truth, necessarily.  Teaching me about evidence of creation is simply nonsense and dishonest.  So far, in my career, having been brought up as a catholic, I have been cheated and swindled by Jews, Catholics, Baptists, one Methodist, and a pile of non-demoninational religious folk bordering on snake handling.  Meanwhile, NOT ONE ATHIEST or AGNOSTIC has EVER cheated or swindled me in the workplace.  At least not one for which I am aware.  Not stating cause and effect, just my experience.   Plenty of religious folks have treated me well too.  20 something) Ha! There are several atheists in my current biolgoy department.  One has been more than charitable for the most part and the other has been nothing but a thorn in my side causing all kinds of problems for the entire department (both in front of and behind our backs).  You have to take everyone on an individual basis.  You can't lump all atheists and agnostics together.  (before 20 something) I agree with you.  However, there is a general philosophy out there that those who have a religious background are more honest or better people than those who are not.  From my experience, there are just as many dishonest a-holes claiming to be of a particular religion as there dishonest a-holes who claim to be athiest or agnostic.  I just have not encountered the athiest/agnostic dishonest a-hole.  I have met plenty of a-hole athiests and agnostics.  (n + 1) I'll take it a very honest step further and say that the great majority of vigorously religious people whom I have encountered in my daily life have been flaiming assholes. I used to be one of them in my oblivously certain youth. Belief fosters a sense of moral superiority; when that belief is tempered by the skepticism inherent in science, it is just a little less annoying.  XX) This is why it's usually pointless to discuss religion.  Too much bullshit. #$%) I think it depends on the relgion too.  Most Southern Baptists I've met have been extremely judgemental, but I know a lot of Catholics that couldn't give a flying fuck.  I also have known a bunch of very judgemental atheists, but know plenty of agnostics that don't care a lick about how you live your life.",NA,NA,NA,"UPitt Major fail last year? https://twitter.com/thegoodphyte/status/748297154691620866, 2) Yeah I was wondering if this was the same search from last year, how could they fail at filling all three positions ?! 3) Wow, that sounds terrible! I know that they also had an assistant prof matching this job description leave for another job last year. 4.) Oh wow - I forgot about thegoodphyte - I remember reading that and thinking 'oh shit' 5) I'd rather move this extended discussion to ""General Discussion"" tab to not clog up the informational front-page. 5) Yeah, that was one of my good friends from grad school. Seems like there was some serious drama/politics between the college and the department and he got stuck in the middle. Maybe still ok to apply if you don't need much lab space? Hard to tell what the real problem was here, but definitely not a good situation. 6) There are a lot of good people in that department and that dean stepped down, so I think it would be good to apply again this year. 7) Still, who would want to work at a place where the Dean can screw you over that badly?  8) I'm not convinced that the dean (rather than the department) screwed him over.  But I'd apply first and ask questions later in this market.  9) We've only heard one side of this story so I'm not drawing any conclusions. 10) This is CM - I'm happy to send all my correspondance with Pitt to anyone considering applying. Don't want to post my email publicly, but you can find it by googling my website. Or message me on Twitter! 11) <-- since posting this my work email has been signed up to 10s of christian spam lists. Thx!   12) Just wanted to bring to the discussion that these aren't the exact same 3 positions from last year that failed, the department has hemorrhaged other talent too, which they are trying to fill in. 13) Maybe we should all apply and request absurd amounts of greenhouse space?x2 14) lol, 15) I heard a comment yesterday (8/29) that makes me think at least one of last year's positions was filled 16) Maybe, but just noticed (while working on tailoring my application) that two of their evo/eco faculty left this year for different (better?) jobs.  More stuff for Pitt from job tab: 7) Here is a quick update on last year’s search at Pitt.  One position was filled and that person will join the department in January (2017).  Another person requested a fairly long-term delay in their start date and negotiations are still underway.  A third person took a job elsewhere and a fourth person had their offer withdrawn after fairly protracted negotiations.  The department has a new chair effective Sept. 1 of 2016 and a new dean of Arts and Sciences will come on board sometime in late 2017 (the search is underway).  It is true that some faculty have left but most took high end administrative positions including one to become chair of a major ecology and evolution department, the other to head up a major ecology research initiative in upstate New York, and a third to become director of science at a large natural history museum. 8) ""protracted negotiations"" lasted 12 days 9) Can some of this be placed in the ""general discussion"" tab? it's getting unwieldy and soon people will want updates placed here... 9) I agree - some of these posts could be moved to another page. 10) This place lost 7 of it 9 EEB faculty in the past two years. The CM situation resulted from a senior professor in the department who demands priority access to the two major greenhouses. They lost another faculty member this year and 2/3 of the positions last year remain unfilled (effectively failed searches). Everything I hear about this place from the folks that left is bad news. 11) neutral party here. If this place lost 7 out of 9 EEB faculty and are recruiting more, then it is a good opportunity to apply and be the new faculty there. They have a new chair and a new Dean and would have learnt from the failed searches before. Searches cost money. And this year they would likely be more generous in offering startup packages and salaries in order not to heave repeated fail searches. Just my two cents worth. 12) Not a neutral party. I agree with post 11. Please interview me! :)  13) Wow, not applying in solidarity after what they did to last year's candiate  14) Department had two of three searches fail last year, one of which from a withdrawn offer as a consequence of the candidate requesting priorty access to 1 of the 3 greenhouses monopolized by the only disingtuished professor in the EEB group there. They've lost 70% of their ecologists to other universities in the past 2 years for similar social issues. 8 )I'm tired of continually moving stuff from this posting -> put this type of stuff (e.g. 5 and 7) in the UPitt discussion in the General Discussion tab.","Get over yourself, ""this isn't eco/evo"" person. Just because YOU wouldn't apply for it doesn't mean that lots of other people here wouldn't.  2) There are multiple ""this isn't eco-evo"" people. Which should perhaps give you pause and make wonder whether the position should in fact qualify as ""eco-evo"".  People work on the evolution of *EVERYTHING* in biology from the evolution of the genetic code to the evolution of the human larynx to the evolution of bird behaviour.  All biology jobs are *POTENTIALLY* related to evolution.  Jobs that aren't explicitly linked to eco/evo shouldn't be listed.  Otherwise, just call it a general biology jobs board. (Which is fine by me.)  3) Hell I think game theory positions in economics departments should be listed. Jobs are hard enough to find.  If >0 evo people are applying, post them all. 4) As someone who joined this wiki in 2010 (when searching for my job) and am now back as I'm on a SC, I find the ""this isn't eco/evo"" comments bizzare and misguided, especially as the ads flagged are often organismal bio type ads that include teaching of human anatomy, which is a class eco/evo types usually teach.  This issue hasn't come up AFAIK in previous years. And many of the jobs the ""this isn't eco/evo"" person flags are most certainly eco/evo.  Basically, eco/evo is: do you study cells?  Or organisms?  If you study organisms, it's eco/evo.  Or another way to put this: many universities have more than one biology department.  They have the microbiology department, and the macrobiology department.  Anything that would fall in macrobiology, is eco/evo.  Eco/evo is a broad. 4) And some of what happens in microbiology departments is eco/evo too. 5) I don't understand the idea behind keeping this list as ""focused"" as possible. Is it really such a pain to scroll through jobs that might not be applicable to you personally, for the sake of making this list broadly useful to all eco-evo folks? We all have to scroll past lots of ads that don't apply to us. 6) to #4 Different generation of folks nowadays. 7) I'd say the same goes for the ""any updates?"" person -- I mean I'm just as curious and impatient as the next person, but Christ almighty. 8) Lots of us are applying to any job we may even sort of be qualified for. I think a broader page is more useful than a narrowly focused one. Only a few positions are added to the wiki every day and there aren't too many of us who dont swing by with some (possibly compulsive) frequency. If a job doesnt apply to you, just keep moving. Its really not that hard.  9) Hey # 7 I like 'any updates?' person - it is like the animated wheel that indicates buffering - we get impatient about it when we see it, but we wouldn't know what to do with just a blank screen (x2). 7) @9 lol that's a fair point, and nice analogy (my vent was largely made in jest) 9) @ 7, as was mine - best of luck to you! 7) likewise :)","Incomplete ad postings Can the moderator change the submission form to require complete information for ads being added?

It wasn't a good fit, but hey they could haev dropped me a note at least.  To your question, it wouldn't hurt much to send in a note to the search chair, but sometimes these things take a long time. 3) Also, it takes long to hear anything because they will wait until a offer is accepted and the contract is signed to give notice to the other candidates. 4) Second the comment from 3, this can be based on HR rules dictated to the search committee, in this situation it's lame but not really the committee's fault
OP1) Thank you all for the advice. I bit the bullet and sent the email...2hrs later, I got a phone call saying I did not get the position.

NA,"UMass Boston Ecosystem Ecologist Anyone hear anything about this position?  I emailed an inquiry a few weeks ago to the search chair but did not receive a response. (1) Haven't heard anything either. For the molecular search, it took a month from the deadline for phone interviews to be scheduled.

",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,what to wear (males)? ,NA,NA,NA,"Salary vs. income No one has ever explained this to me, so I'm asking here: how much does the salary given differ from most assistant professor's incomes? For instance, if you have a 9 month contract at $75,000, how often your annual income $100,000, and how much does this vary by institution type? I imagine many research-intensive schools have many faculty with grants to fill their summer salary, and many liberal arts college professors teach in the summer, but what's a good benchmark for equating 9 month contracts to annual income? 2) Personally, I just think of my 9-month salary as my annual salary and any summer salary as a bonus.  With NSF success rates around 7%, good luck consistently getting two months off grants.  Of course it's possible, but not for everyone, so don't take out a mortgage based on that assumption! 3) At my highly ranked R1 graduate school none of the profs that I knew well were consistently funded in the summer off of grants (maybe an extra month once in a while). Even those that got NSF grants fairly regularly often didn't write in full summer support because the budgets are so limited, especially if you want to hire postdocs and grad students off of that money. I guess it is probably more common in fields funded by NIH grants with much bigger budgets. OP) Thanks, that cleared up a mysterious part of academia. 4) I always try to get all 3 months, but usually only wind up with 1-2 months. 5) The other thing that surprised me (at least at my institution) was that summer from grants comes basically as bonus chunk of extra salary during summer months, with the ostensibly '9 month' base still distributed over 12 months. Why it is done this way remains a mystery.... 5) I didn't understand this until a few months into my R1 position. Everything is based off of your 9 month salary, and you will do well to consider that your ""true"" salary. Benefits, life insurance multiples, etc. Summer money is just that. Taxes are taken out, but you will pay accelerated benefits (if you take your salary over 9 months). Summer money become bonus funny money. Think salesperson commission, I suppose. 6) Since no one ever answered the OPs original question, here's an example from my first regional job. 9 month contract = approximately $65K/year. Summer salary = approximately $7K per full time course; basically, 1/9th of the full-time salary. Teaching two summer courses would bring my income up to about $80K a year off of a base $65K/9 months. To me, it was well worth it. More money in my pocket, more money going toward retirement, etc... Teaching a class a few hours a day for 4 weeks is pretty easy, but then again, my research isn't dependent on travel and extensive field work. I was always shocked that more faculty refuse to teach over the summer. A lot of them say things like, ""that's when I get all my work done,"" but then they don't really do any work...","Got two rejection emails within one hour today. One for a job I applied to ~3 weeks ago and one for a job I applied for 1+ year ago. Too soon AND too late? I don't understand why they even bothered with the one year later rejection. Just in case your current job search isn't bad enough, here is a reminder that you also didn't get a job last year!! 2) 3 weeks ago sounds like they hit the wrong button by misake??? Either that or it's for a specific senior hire and they rejected everyone else.  Most comittees can't even get through all the apps in 3 weeks. 3) Some searches do run that quickly. Received campus invitation after two days once. 4) OP: 3 week rejection was for an assistant prof position and I know from this wiki that interviews were scheduled just a couple of days before rejections went out. I guess they wanted to be done with it!  5) A rejection that quick probably indicates you did not meet some minimum requirements for the position and they don't care to burn the bridge right out of the gate (like area of expertise, teaching experience, grantsmanship).  ....hey, at least you know and don't have to fixate on it.  6) There is nothing called ""minimum requirement"". There are so many good candidates and so few jobs. I think it's nice that universities send out timely rejection letters to those who were not in the long list. 7) When we run searches, we send rejections to candidates who don't make the grade as soon as we review them. Potentially appointable candidates, we don't notify until after we've made the hire.  8) Keep in mind ""don't make the grade"" includes you're an animal person who applied (unwittingly) to a search where all interviewees are plant people.  I swapped ""no letter request"" lists with a few friends.  It made very little sense which specific searches we were considered for vs not. ","Ads after closing date Sup with all the jobs listed today, after the closing date? Were these all from one person who withheld until after the closing? 2) Seems like it. Good thing none of them fit my experiences and interests. 3) All cellular and molecular jobs that most people here wouldn't bother posting...IMO they don't belong on this ecoevo board 4)  Just saw all of those.  Looks like they are wanting to see if anyone has any updates. None are eco/evo jobs in any way shape or form and should be purged  x3 5) Yeah, and take yer stinkin' HHMI and NIH money with you! X3  6) Actually, I'd be OK with them leaving the HHMI & NIH money here and just taking the jobs... X -1  7)  There are people who study the evolution of cancer.  By the same rationale that people argued that human anatomy jobs are OK here, the cancer jobs should also remain. 8) nah, they should go.  This is not a gen bio/med/micro group.  It's bogging down the job listings. x2 9) You can probably make arguments about some individual jobs on this list, but I think the important point here is not rewarding bad behavior on this board. Some person had 20-30 jobs that are all somewhat peripheral to this board. They waited until all the applications were past due and then posted them in one big batch to try to get updates without contributing to the shared resource that the wiki represents. I don't get too annoyed at posting a job or two after the deadline that didn't make it onto the board for whatever reason, but this seems like a pretty clear violation of the spirit of this resource. x5 AP) I'm seeing a general consensus that the recent slew of non-ecoevo jobs (lines 376-415) don't belong here.

I just got an offer from a school with really early application deadline. While I like this school a lot, I am also interested in other schools I am applying that have much later deadlines (some are even next year). In this situation, is there anything I could/should do? Any advice would be really appreicated! 2) Congrats! As awesome as you probably are, odds are that you will not receive another offer this year. So I would ask yourself whether this place is somewhere you could be happy, at least for a few years. If the answer is yes, my advice is to accept. from #1) My second visit to the offer is currently scheduled to be in Febuary (when their school starts). Accordingly, I imagine I could be interviewing with other positions during that time frame. But #2 is a good advice, thank you!! 3) I would take the first job I'm offered and run. But that's just me.  4)  Take it and if you get a better offer bail and take the better offer.  No one is looking out for you other than you, so while this seems like a shitty thing to do, you need to do what is best for you.  Take it, interview elsewhere, if you get a better offer, take it. 5) To an extent I agree with number 4, though remember that it really is a small world, and you want to avoid making life hard on too many people. Just be as honest with yourself and SC's as you can, and do you best to not leave anyone hanging. But the fact is, if you have an offer I would error on the side of playing it safe and accepting, unless you know for sure something better is coming. As number 2 said, it's unlikely you will be offered more than one job this year (as great as you might be). Either way, congratulations! 6) Keep looking for jobs until you've accepted your first offer. If you have a return visit scheduled for February, there's still a little time to stay in the game. Be sure to let the search committees at your open jobs know that you have an offer, so they can hurry up if they want you. @4, as discussed at length under ""Reneging on job acceptance"", the ethics of continuing to interview after saying yes to your first offer are disputed, to say the least. 7) @4, perhaps you come across differently in real life, but the way I read your comment, I very much hope that the people I interact with in my department, at future schools, as students, etc, don't ever bring that attitude to the table. Please do take care of yourself, but doing so does not mean screwing over anyone and everyone who may call upon you to think beyond yourself. That is a toxic attitude in job searching and beyond. from #1) Thank you all for the advice. I want to make the best choice for myself, but I also want to be a good citizen (especially the offer is from a great place with nice people!). If at one point I have to decide before I hear back from all schools, I will just follow my heart! 8) don't sign until after 2nd interview & they hand you a letter with a deadline.  If something else comes up before the deadline, see where it goes.  I had an offer that I decided, relucantly, that I couldn't accept, so I turned it down.  Later that season I got an offer at an attractive R1.  Patience can pay.  Given that you like the offer in the hand a lot, though....9) Tell them yes or no only after your second visit, but please do not do what #4 says. This is unprofessional and unethical, and one can only get away of that kind of behavior if he/she hides behind the shadow for the rest of the career.",NA,"Loan Forgiveness What are your thoughts on requesting student loan assistance during start-up negotiations? If some folks can negotiate for a spousal hire, is it far off base to ask about federal student loan forgiveness programs at the university? 2) PSLF is a federal program. 3) PSLF allows you to make income-based payments with interest for 10 years before forgiveness, if you're in a public Uni. I'm curious if anyone requested a lump sum as part of their start-up package. 4) If you work for a non-profit private university, your payments qualify too (but you'd have to check whether they indeed qualify). I'd generally be shocked if an employer did provide loan assistance because it's really not their problem. 5) I agree that as a personal choice, loans related to education are not their problem, but neither are spouses or family obligations - which are frequently accomadated in a package (dual hires, delayed start dates due to child birth, etc.).  6) those things are about a future investment, not paying someone's education  7) If you are NIH funded at any stage, there is an NIH loan repayment program.  Might not help you as faculty, but NIH funded pdocs might want to check it out!  https://www.lrp.nih.gov/ 8) As I recall, the first PSLF came up recently, and 99% were rejected. Don't count on that. 9) thanks for spreading the propaganda - most of those people didn't have the right forms or worked for the right kind of institutions. Read the fine print and unless your consolidated your loans in the right place and you get a monthlly statement that says you haven't made as many payments as you thought, start making phone calls. The truth is that PSLF works. I speak from experience. 10) 8 here - I'm glad that worked for you, but when 99% of people have a different experience, it's important to bring that fact into consideration. If you're going to count on that, be informed. See some other takes here https://www.npr.org/2018/09/21/650508381/data-shows-99-of-applicants-for-student-loan-forgiveness-denied and here https://www.forbes.com/sites/prestoncooper2/2018/09/25/everyone-calm-down-about-rejected-student-loan-forgiveness-applications/#20066f9a7f6f 11) Yeah, most of the people I know that got to 10 years did not get their loans forgiven. 12) Probably because they didn't follow the rules and had the wrong job, didn't certify annually or didn't use the right servicer. The rules are strict but the procedures are somewhat simple nowadays, but weren't for many years after the first laws were passed. It took years for the DOE to come up with forms for the process. As a result there is plenty of confusion and unfortunately dishonesty among loan servicers, for example.  Plenty of banks want to kill the program because they are losing income (Bush and Obama moved private banks out of the student loan market, but banks want to do everything possible to come back) so want to spread nonsense so people give up.  Read the articles.  There's plenty of hysteria in the world, and it doesn't help if it's propagated here. 13) I don't think hysteria is being propagated. The first group of people who went through this process had a really tough time. This is important to highlight so that people today take more time reading the rules before they start doing stuff with their student loans or accepting student loans. Unfortunately, for a lot of us, we started doing things with our student loans before we went to graduate school so we never really knew we'd be interested in such a program. 14) This is an interesting question that I've never considered. I think offering debt repayment would be a great thing to try to negotiate. TT jobs require a PhD... & PhD requires a BS/ sometimes MS, so I think this is a reasonable request--especially if from a low-income background.",NA,"Will there be a negotiations tab this year? 1) Just wondering... x6 AP) Yeah we'll get to it soon, ditto anon quals."
NA,Clark U Any news or update for the Clark U bio position? 1) They posted their interview candidates some time ago.  Last one is on Feb 3.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"why search fail? 1) I've received no training/advice on startup funds, and I can't imagine I'm the only one who feels a bit clueless there. The Negotiations tab has been very helpful, but if there are other articles/blog posts or whatever that others have found helpful, please post here. (2) Have you talked to your advisor? new faculty in your department? do you want R1/R2/SLAC? what field? More info at http://theprofessorisin.com/2014/02/28/how-to-negotiate-your-tenure-track-offer/ OP) Thanks for your input. I'd ask for advice for all positions in the interest of anyone else reading this. Masters-level and SLAC would be most helpful, since most PhD and postdoc advisors have no experience there (3) I just negotiated start-up with a dean, and the person that was the most helpful was the newest hire in the department who had just done the same thing last year.  In my situation at least, the money comes from the dean and the department really wanted me to get everything I needed, so it was in their best interest to give me advice. (4) figure out what you need to be successful - eg supplies, student funds, summer funds, travel - do not accept what you could make do with if you will not make you a success 5) What #3 said. On all of the interviews I have done, the faculty constantly stress that if I were to receive the offer, I should contact the most recent hire in the dept as well as the chair and send them the startup list for feedback before negotiating with the dean. Everyone in the dept wants you to get the most you can (team effort), especially if that equipment can be used by others in the dept. Further, I have been advised by many to not ask for consummables if there is a cap on what you can request. Many depts have research funds for consummables that need not be part of your startup. Long story short, talk to your chair. They are your ally when it comes to negotiations. The dean is not an ally.",NA,NA,NA,"Spousal hire When do you bring up the need for a spousal hire? Does your answer differ if it's a small school that seems less likely to have the resources for a spousal hire? Is it fair to the search committee/other candidates to take an interview spot knowing that if they can't provide a spousal hire you won't take the job? 2) My opinion is to never mention it until you have an offer. No, it's not unfair of you to take an interview spot - go for it. 3) Never until you have an offer. Never. 4) Any insight on this situation in European universities? My impression is they are less flexible 5) Definitely less flexible in Europe. My spouse has had 2 job offers in Europe and they flat out said they didn't do spousal hires. I've heard from others that sometimes it is offerred though, but those are select institutions that have lots of resources. 6) Thanks, #5! ","1) I'm new faculty and my dept is hiring.  I'm starting to worry that the search chair of a long open position is tanking our search.  He keeps saying there are no qualified applicants when I know my friends have excellent CVs in the pile.  I'm not sure what if anything I can do about it.  2) Can you talk to others on the search committee about their pulse of the applicant pool? Or take your concern to the department chair or dean?  1)They haven't convened the search committee, but talking to them is top on my list as soon as they do.  I hope they get to see the apps. It's really inexcusable. 3) R1, R2, M/L, SLAC? 4) If the search committee doesn't get to see the apps, then something is very wrong in your department. x2 5) Yeah, I'd really like to know what type of university this is. 6) Are you on the quarter system?  It tends to be hard for us to get our search going before the start of the quarter 6) Hahaha, this is beginning to sound like a game of ""guess who""","Can't attend on-campus interview It might be risky for me to attend the on-campus interview (medical reason). But I could do the interview in the new year or via video-conference. Should I take a risk and attend the on-campus or ask the SC for other options? Would other options, video-conference or on-campus at much later date, hurt my chances? 2) Well, it depends on the risk, but IMO not being there in person will hurt your chances. Ask them.3) I would take care of yourself first - ask them (I'd probably be as specific as you feel comfortable being), realizing they may not or just don't want to be accomodating. But if they aren't, perhaps it's not the kind of place you want to be anyway?  4) I heard of a video-conference interview due to a very late-term pregnancy, and they got the offer!  I feel like on-campus is best, so it's worth asking if they can wait a month for you to come in the new year... (<-wow! way to go for  that search committee!) 5) Take care of yourself first. It's important to you, and to the place you interview as well. If the medical reason is something that you are comfortable to share (such as pregnancy), it will be good that you discuss with the search committee. Normally they can wait one or two weeks  after the last canddiate finishing interview, unless there is budget deadline for them.  6)  Interviewing on-site is required by my department; if you can't, you are no longer considered.  Now, we've never had someone with a medical condition not be able to come after invited, so not sure how this would typically be handled from a non-discrimination viewpoint. 7) I postponed an interview last year for a month bc I was too pregnant. I will say interviewing w a 4 week old was probably a zillion times more logistically and emotionally challenging than interviewing 9 months pregnant would have been. I think I'm still in shock over the whole interview situation. Didn't get the job, and felt like I sacrificed some important early mom time to make it happen. 8) Currently pregnant now and too far along to hide it; I think I'll have to let any SC know if I'm invited what's going on as I become less mobile and able to waddle from one session to the next. Such is the mom life. 9) As someone said above, I think I might have been better off 7-8 months pregnant than with a small baby who is breastfeeding! 10) Agree with 7 and 9-- I interviewed across the country at 37.5 weeks and it was much easier than trying to travel with a newborn!  As long as your health permits, there are many airlines with no restrictions on how late you can fly in your pregnancy (Alaska Air for instance).  You can also get a doctor's note, and look up hospitals in the area just in case!  Good luck. 11) Agree with the above advice about seeking to postpone.  To add to what 5 said, it's probably too early in the year for there there to be budget reasons.  Budget reasons arise in April-ish in that the search may need to conclude before the end of the current fiscal year on July 1. Some searches automatically fail if not concluded then. 12) Original poster here: thanks for your thoughts and advice. I'm going to take my doctor's advice and not travel (due to a complicated pregnancy). I'll be doing the interview remotely via video-conference during the same time that I was scheduled for the on-campus interview. The SC is being very accommodating. 13) Good luck! #7 here, interviewing while pregnant and/or with a young baby/pumping/etc is a challenge, but the search committees (except for 1) I met with over that time period were very okay with things and the younger the faculty, the more understanding overall I found (probably bc if they were parents they still had memory of how crazy that time of life is). You'll be great, and keep the conversation focused on your research and teaching, show them you are serious and successful!  14) Thank-you #7 -- I interviewed when my little guy was 5 months old and that was tough (I hadn't slept in 5 months). I can't imagine how challenging it would have been with a 4 week old.",NA,"Canada I'm an American with a Canadian partner. We live in the US now but would be happy if I got a job in Canada, but it seems like I'm at a disadvantage for those not being a CA resident. Is it worth mentioning I could easily become a permanent CA resident in my letters when I apply for CA jobs? 2) I think any disadvantage for a US citizen would arise from the Canadian HR mandate that they give preference to Canadian citizens, all else equal. Any American with a University job offer will have no problem getting a visa and then permanent residence soon after, once they move there. So not sure it would make a difference to mention this, except maybe simply establishing a personal connection with the location, although that seems a little strange to do in a cover letter to me 3) And I have seen many not canadian getting faculty jobs in canada, so I feel the preference for canadian is rarely an issue in the decision. x2 4) I agree with #2 but will add if you are applying in Quebec and speak French, you should include that in your CV and establishing your personal connection might indicate to the search committee that you would be more likely to accept a position if offered. 2) again, @3, I used to think this doesnt matter (I did my phd in canada) but I think it might depend a bit on the department, the search, and the school. It definetly seems like some Canadian departments interview way more Canadians than foreigners, at least anecdotally, yet they are likely getting many US applicants these days especially. 5) I'm in the same position as OP. They typically ask you to include a statement about your citizenship (like in the cover letter), so I mention it there. What could it hurt? 6) I don't see how this could hurt to mention briefly in your cover letter, especially if by partner you mean spouse. OP) Thanks for the advice everyone! (and happy to hear more if anyone else has thoughts.) To give an example, the recently posted UVic job says: ""in accordance with Canadian Immigration requirements, Canadians and permanent residents will be given priority."" 7) If you're really interested in Canada, it's not *that* hard to get Canadian permanent residency from outside the country. I am doing it right now- if you're fluent in English with a PhD and some work experience, you meet the criteria for Express Entry. The whole process start to finish can be done in under a year for under $1500. 8) Wow, even their immigration system is friendly. 9) The Canadian government LITERALLY came recruiting on my campus a few weeks ago, walking us through how to get Canadian PR. 9) In most instances, for an Canadian U to hire a non-Canaidan/non Canadian PR, they need to argue that no Canadian can fit the job. This means that if there is a suitable Canadian they will usually win over even a better American because to hire the American they need to claim that no onther candidates that they interveiwed are suitable/qualified. If, in that scenario, they offer the American the job and it gets turned down, they need to fail they search. Or, at least that has been my experience OP) Interesting! I currently have a (non-TT) job in the US, which I don't want to leave til I get a TT position, but it sounds like becoming a PR could really improve my chances in Canada--good to know. 10) Why doesn't USA have the same rule in reverse?",NA,"Is the review begins on X date the due date for full consideration? 1) OP I have always assumed that when a post says ""Review of applications will begin on xx/xx"" that means that you need to have your materials in by that date. However, my supervisor is currently the search head for a job on here and she just asked me ""why is our job listing highlighted"" red?  I replied that is was likely because the due date was passed. She replied 'Well that is just the date we start looking at things.' So what do you all think? I would be curious to know what you assume based on your career stage. I think most grad students and post docs interpret that review date as the final date for being considered as a candidate with their [stuff] together. 2) Search Committee member here.  That's the date that we will download apps and start review.  We usually leave it open indefinitely so that if the search fails we can go back and look at any other applications without redoing the position withe admins.   So if you want your app reviewed, submit it the day before. 3) Another search committee member. I agree with 2. Maybe if we haven't had many applications might gather the few coming in after the date, but usually only ones there on the date will get reviewed. +1 4) What if the application is in by the due date but some of the letters are not? Especially when the application only asks for names but letters are requested automatically. x2  5) #3 again. My experience is committees are more flexible about missing letters because it's largely out of the applicants control. And a good committee will seek to get letters submitted if they like the application. And if only names are asked, a few weeks are given for those to be sent. AP) In the past we labeled this column ""closing date"", which led to searches with wording like ""review will begin on MM/DD/YY and continue until a suitable candidate is found"" ending up with no deadline on the page.  So now it's ""review date"", as in ""this is when review will start"".  In any case, I suggest submitting your application on or before that date. 6) If, unfortunately, an application is submitted the day after the review date, is there any benefit to sending an email to dept chair or faculty trying to let them know you exist? Or does that look bad? Was a perfect position but just couldn't make the time to get it in before or on the review date :( 7) For an answer please refer to committee member on venting page rageposting about candidates not getting materials in  2) If the position is still open but review has begun then yes, email the chair. Be apologetic and tell them you'd love to apply but saw the ad too late.  They could say no, but it's worth a shot.  Usually the committee will just be starting to look at apps and it's easy to add yours into the pile.  Submit the app first, email the chair second, but be prepared for a 'no'.  Your chances are better if it's been days not weeks.  If the position is closed it will be very difficult to get your app through HR.  That's part of why you so often see positions stay open long after the review date.  8) Had a position yesterday that said 'submit materials by 10/21' but my materials (1/2 complete) were automatically submitted at 5pm. After 5pm they couldn't be edited any more. First time that's happened to me. Beware.   2) I'd email the search chair to explain what happened, 8.  Send fully complete docs when you do.  If HR didn't say 5pm then they should accept the completed app.  "
NA,"Aurora University I can't believe that I've just been rejected by them.  Seriously. 1) I have had a few of those too 2) Me too. 3) I think we're all a bit bitter about all the rejections, and maybe I'm misinterpreting your tone...but if they're that pathetic of a school why did you apply? The job market is unfortunately such that none of us can assume that we're doing a school a favor by bothering to apply. Again, maybe that isn't what you meant (and sorry if I'm wrong), but I got a snobby vibe from your post. Especially since many of us, me included, would take any job we could get this year, and my rejection from Aurora will probably be waiting for me in my mailbox when I get to school Monday morning. I will be bummed out, not offended. 4) It's not necessarily snobby. In some cases, I've applied for jobs thinking that I'm not just well qualified, but also a perfect ""fit""--e.g. my expertise matches precisely with the specific requests in the job advertisement, I could clearly describe how my work would fit in with existing faculty research, etc. It shakes one's confidence a bit (to say the least) when a place like that doesn't even ask for your letters, and there have been a number of cases where I've thought the same thing as the OP. 5) Thank you for this post, OP! I've had this feeling too for various reasons. 6) OK, this is 3 again. I have to agree with 4 after reading the posts. It's tough to get the tone sometimes from a post without body language, but the ""seriously"" seemed more offended dignity than stunned surprise. So, sorry OP if I misinterpreted. (7) To #4, I know what you're saying. I've seen job ads that seemed tailored for me and my work. However, the problem is, with the glutted job market these days, that there are likely tons of other candidates with at least equally perfectly matched credentilas, and many with even more. So it should not come as a surprise that what would appear as a perfect match from our perspective as a job candidate, might be ""just another applicant"" for the SC. 
(8) OP here.  I see how my post could have been construed as snobbish, but it was more along the lines of - I am a damn good candidate for the job AND I live close enough that it would cost them very little to interview me (no travel or accommodations costs), and yet they still tossed my application out as soon as they saw it.  To be entirely honest I should admit I guess that my bitterness brought out some snobbery there, as well.  Sort of:  ""You don't want me? Well then, I guess that you weren't even good enough for me in the first place, and I don't know why I even applied for that position to begin with!"". ",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Wiki is not succesful 1) I've been applying for many positions where my research is within the confines of the department, but barely, and I have little in common with the rest of faculty.

All statements of 'x appeals to me because...' ring particularly hollow in these cases, since there's no one I can really foresee collaborating with. Should I just not apply? Times are tough, tho! It feels silly to not apply to something I sorta-almost fit...2) You can, but would be just wasting your time. For the position that you sorta-almost-fit, there would be 50 other candidates that would be a good fit and 10 who would be a perfect fit. You will be better off spending your time putting together good applications to the positions which you are a good fit. 3) I've been making that hard decision lately a lot. It's hard to not apply for everything you might kinda fit in these times, but there are just too many people out there looking for jobs who would fit perfectly. 4) Apply for them all. My first tenure-track job was not in my area of interest. I had the background to teach the courses that needed taught but my research was in a different field. 5) I have always been honest about my research but been as vague as possible if I was trying to make it sound like I fit what they are looking for. Mostly, I always make sure to use words in my cover letter that they use in the a - job posting and b - department description on their website. I also capitalize on mentioning my diverse teaching background and that I am adaptable. And on this insane job market, you have to ask yourself if you just want A job or if you want a job that you can actually do/be happy in for a career. Those kinds of postings are few and far between for most of us. 6) I've heard faculty members say SCs often don't have an ideal candidate in mind when they begin the process - sometimes you're the candidate they didn't know they wanted until they saw it. Unless you've had a good conversation with several faculty members within the department, it's really tough to know how the process will play out. In short, if you think you can stand working there, tell them exactly who you are, even if it looks like a weird fit; sometimes, that'll line up with what they want. 3 again) 4 makes a great point - it is often more about the teaching that needs doing than the research, at least at smaller schools. I'm pretty sure though that if you can't teach most of what they want, you aren't going to make it though. Maybe fit (at least in area of expertise) is a little less important in a way at research schools because they might decide they want you just because you are awesome and you kinda-sorta fit the job ad.",NA,NA,NA,"""Desired Salary""? A nervewracking question I've never come across - renewable/permanent nontenured instructor postion at a small college in a midwestern city is asking me for a ""desired salary"". It's required, and I must enter a number value. I'd like $60,000 year, but part of me worries it's too high? Or that they'll just toss my application because of it? Help! 2) I'd be honest with them about your desired salary, and heck, I'd even bump it up to $66000 to allow 10% for negotiation.  If they are unable to pay you a living wage, look for another job. 3) You can also find a few resources online to compare salaries for similar positions at similar institutions. If nothing else, glassdoor has information, although good numbers can be tough to find for some colleges 4) The negotiation pages of the past wikis should give you a hint. 5) The Chronicle of Higher Education has a database of salaries for each university by rank, though obviously it varies by field of study which isn't reflected. 6) http://data.chronicle.com/#/id=table 6) if it's a state school, salaries are public info and often school newspapers will publish them so you can google them 7) 66k is a bit too high, that was my starting salary at an R1 in a somewhat expensive area 8) Although 66K may be too high for a small midwestern college, 66K is way too low for starting salary at an R1, particularly in an expensive area (unless that was a long time ago (the chronicle site is useful - usually will be higher in Biology than other departments unless there are med-schools/pharmacy schools etc. driving up the average 9) #7 here, I disagree, 8: 66K starting salary is not ""way too low"".  At least at my university, pay raises are somewhat easy to come by (although this is of course not true everwhere) and so nobody stays at 66k for long.  The faculty at nearby SLACs that make in the low 50ks and don't as easily get raises are the ones suffering.","12 applications down, 8 to go (of current job calls). Im already so burned out. 2) I'm 10/20 applications complete, equally as burned out! 3) If you are burned out by a couple of applications, think of all the grant proposals and the lectures you need to prepare when you finally get the job. 4) Even at NSF funding rates grant proposals have a much better chance of being funded than job applications! Plus, you actually get at least some modicum of feedback on how to improve for the next round. And lectures at least give you the satisfaction of delivering them without feeling that a huge amount of time and energy was just dumped into a black hole. Seriously, I kind of get what you are saying, but I would WAY rather spend my time on grants and lectures... 5) I won't mind doing my job (writing grants, teaching). Fair to be burned out by a completely different process. 6) This. There's a huge opportunity cost associated with applications. I'm writing lectures and papers at the same time as sending letters into the void. 7) 2 again, yeah I do all of those things too. I'm currently in a post-doc postion with teaching duties. On top of what 3 said, never am I applying for 20 grants in a month and lectures aren't that difficult relatively (i.e I have a book chapter or something to at least base my lecture on).  8) +1 to what #3 said. A 15-page grant proposal is harder to write than a good cover letter + teaching and research statement. When applying for jobs a few years ago I think I lost about 1 month per year of productivity due to job applications.  As an asst prof I've been losing about 2 months of productivity per year on grant proposals. Also for those of you who are like ""I'm never writing another research statement once I get a job""... well, turns out as an asst prof you may get to do exactly that seemingly every year when your file goes up. 9) Someone clearly didn't understand what #4 wrote. As an assistant professor, you're probably not doing all of your research yourself, unless you don't have a lab. You also know where you'll be living for the next few years. x3 10) Not to mention that it is a bit weird to think of time writing grant proposals as 'lost productivity'. You may not like grant proposals, but it is actually a step in the process of producing science! In contrast, job applications aren't related to progress on specific projects (or only very indirectly in the sense that you need a job to be able to keep working on projects). x3 11) Once the templates are written, job applications mostly consist of researching departments you will never join to tailor the cover letter. Not comparable to developing ideas for a grant. 12) The interviews will go to the people who have taken the time to write a well prepared application package. 13) 11 again. My point was that tailoring takes time, but the chances you'll get something concrete out of your investment in a given individual letter are slim. With a grant, you'll have articulated your ideas, not just spent hours figuring out what you have in common with people you will never work with. Current faculty will often claim it should take no more than 15 minutes to dash off an application. That may have been true back in the day, when the market was different, but it's unrealistic now. 14) to #13, I agree with you, it is unfortunate. But given the market now, where the supply far exceed the demand, every bit of preparation will help. If I don't spend the time tailoring a cover letter, someone else will get the interview instead of me. 15) 13 again. I agree it's necessary, since the applicant has to demonstrate that they ""belong"". Unless shortlisting is happening based mostly on CV, but in those cases you are often also expected to write about how you fulfill the criteria for the position in detail (more common in UK). That be quite time-consuming, as there are sometimes multiple pages. 16) 3 is clearly out of touch if he thinks there aren't postdocs who are also teaching and writing proposals (and only crafting 2 applications). X2 17) #8 here again-- I must disagree with #9 and #13, a grant proposal that is not funded and winds up getting abandoned after 3 or 4 submissions is in fact a complete and total waste of time.  Sometimes you can turn those into a review (which is great and not wasted productivity) but sometimes not. The art of writing a good cover letter, and a good research statement (both of which are necessary but not sufficient to land a job) gets honed in the job application stage  and then ramps up further once you are faculty. Like many forms of writing, the more you do it, the faster and easier it gets.  18) <- Patronizing much? The art ""ramps up"" when you are faculty? If unfunded proposals aren't leading to any new ideas and deepened background knowledge, you have to wonder. 19) OP here....Well, that went somewhere unexpected. Im faculty but looking for another gig, so Im also teaching two classes and writing grant applications at the same time. I enjoy both of those because they are mentally engaging and I get to be creative. Tailoring the shell of an application over and over and over again is a dreary slog that is mentally draining but not satisfying. 20) <- well said. Burnout happens not from hard work but from pointless, thankless work. 21) Also, the more particular applicaiton materials are tailored, the greater the chances of inadvertent copy/paste errors or specific comments targeted to school X slipping through to your applicaiton to school Y. Definitely speaking from experience... 22) Four-time SC member here - I can tell you that in my department it is critical for applicants to tailor their letters and statements to our department indicating how they fit the job ad, complement existing faculty strengths, teach courses we do not already offer, and provide novel research approaches for students. ""Broadcast"" applications rarely make the first cut, in my experience.","How many applications do you have to submit to statistically get a job offer Today I have submitted my 70th job application. So far only one phone interview. Seriously, I must have something wrong. Besides clear accomplishments, I believe I have an appealing research program, and strong commitment to teaching, mentoring, diversity, inclusion. I feel so hopeless. What do you think it is statistically the number of applications you need to submit to get a job offer? Or at least an on-campus interview, or even the feeling that the SC notices your application. 2) Are most of those 70 applications ones you feel like you would be a good fit for? That seems high to me, unless they have accrued over 3-4 years. Regardless, that sucks, and I'm sorry and I understand that hopeless feeling. 3) I don't think that is really answerable since everyones 'baseline' odds are likely to be so different. I've applied to ~85 jobs over 3-4 years. I've had 7 phone/skype interviews, 2 campus visits, and 1 offer that I had to turn down (would not have worked for a variety of reasons). No responses at all yet this year... 4) Just talked to someone that got hired at an R1 with 8 publications, because they told a good story and were really interesting. It's a giant crapshoot. 5) if you use data from the old total to tenure track tab (which someone deleted this year, and you should not consider a good data source), the average ratio of apps to offers is about 36 : 1 6) https://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2017/01/04/you-cant-tell-much-about-your-odds-of-getting-an-interview-for-a-faculty-position-from-common-quantitative-metrics/ 7) very interesting article. Thanks for sharing! 7) This is my first year I've applied to ~14 (mostly decent fit) I've gotten 2 skype interviews, one on-campus interview (not skype for that one) and still waiting for news in everything. It is truly a numbers game, so random. A good friend of mine had 4 on-campus interviews last year (no offers) and this year she hasn't gotten a single skype interview, so there. 8)  At that number of jobs if people with CVs on par with yours are landing jobs and you aren't something is wrong.  Start shuffling your rec letters.  Something could be up with one of them.  Also ask Sr faculty to heavily criticize your next job practice talk.  Whatever comes up in phone interviews try to sound enthusiastic especially about the school.  One thing committees are trying to sort out is whether you are serious about the job.  Don't worry about any one job.  If you could go back to a faculty member at a place you interviewed to ask for advice on what to change, do it.  It will have to be someone who liked you but who has enough backbone to say real criticism.   It's better to hear it and get a job than get compliments and not land a position.  Good luck. 9) In my experience, faculty won't tell you anything beyond 'fit' when asked why you weren't chosen after an interview. I've asked several times and have given up on asking at this point. I don't agree with #8 that something must be wrong. Of course materials and answers can be made better, but I know lots of people with great materials who have really struggled to land any jobs (and others who got great jobs right away despite comparable qualifications). 10) Here #1 again. Thanks for the support, I've got also a skype interview now, my statistics is getting better :) To reply #8, my application and/or background might have weaknesses that are not liked by the SC (and I know some of them regarding my general background, unfortunately, I can't do anything to change it, such as too long in academia after PhD degree). However, I have no doubt that my references write good letters. and today I submit #73! 11) Thanks for sharing @1, it is helpful to have others commiserating. Keep at it! I've only applied to 20-ish jobs so far and have yet to hear anything (I have a pretty good publication record, have acquired grants, and taught classes as an instructor of record). I did make a short list, but other than that sometimes I wonder if something is wrong.

Then I would say yes 5) Something like this that'll have a really divided opinion I always go with the conservative answer which is NO because saying NO you wont have the people who don't consider preprints as real publication pissed off and its those little things that ticks off people you know? 6) Put it on and note that its a preprint. If this annoys somebody, those aren't people you want to work with anyway. 7) Just list them in a separate section, e.g. ""peer-reviewed publications"", ""submitted manuscripts"", and ""preprints"". If the preprint is submitted, list them in the ""submitted"" section. x7 8) I have a separate section after the peer reviewed stuff for in prep/submitted/preprints. The numbering runs through continuously, so people can decide which ones to count. 9) @8, how do you order that section? Is it submitted first, then preprints, then in prep? Or first author first, then others? 10) I usually don't have more than two items listed there, but yes, I'd normally order them based on how far they are in the pipeline. My name is bolded in the author list anyway, and I haven't put middle author ones in that section recently. 10) mostly agree here - preprints are not publications, as they are not peer-reviewed.  This has come up during searches that I have been involved in - if you are going to list Biorxiv or PeerJ Preprint or anything else, it should be in a second, clearly labeled section.  I can say from experience faculty view including preprints in peer-reviewed publications poorly. 11) if it is ACCEPTED (or in press), then yes it is effectively done.  You can (and should) list it, as accepted.  Otherwise, open for discussion.  I might list something that is in review (if actually made it past the desk and in review, not just submitted), but otherwise no. 12) What if the paper was accepted after you've submitted your application? Would it be worthwile to let the department know that your Biorxiv paper is now an accepted paper?  13.  it depends.  if you are posting it there permanently and you know it's good stuff you might list it.  in physics a preprint is absolutely counted there.  then there is the issue of people who don't know what they are.

NA,"news anyone heard about requests for letters, short lists or anything else about University of Northern Colorado's search for Animal Biologist??? 1)Nada 2) Just got a request for a phone interview, looks like they will have several running from Feb 3rd-9th. 3) said that phone interviewees would be contacted within 2 weeks with decisions on who will be brought to campus for interviews.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Writing the job season off If a school offers you a position and they give you a salary and startup figure, how do you know how much higher salary and startup you should ask for?  I worry about them changing their mind.  I know it is silly to be worried about wanting to be ""liked"", but I don't want to come across as too inflexible/not realistic. 2) Same here, especially at a SLAC. There's that horror story of the woman last year at Nazareth getting the offer taken off the table. I sure don't want that to happen, but I don't want to be that woman who doesn't negotiate for herself either. 3) I'm no expert, but perhaps the Negotiations page here can help? Also look up the average faculty salary of the state, etc. 4) FYI: http://chronicle.com/article/2013-14-AAUP-Faculty-Salary/145679?cid=megamenu#id=table 5) I have been advised to ask for at least a 10% increase above the first bid, or whatever you think you are worth... whichever is higher. If the dean/provost says salary levels are fixed, game over. Most SLACs have starting salaries between 50K and 67K. I would say going beyond that range is dangerous territory where you can come across as not understanding ""the LAC environment."" As for startup salaries, I have been advised to have three numbers: dream amount, workable, bare bones. Most SLACs can only provide the last. 6) the higher the salary they offer, the more flex there is in their offer. 7) Thanks! That Chronicle table is really helpful! Negotiations page here is farily helpful, but it doesn't include specific institution or even state, etc. 8) I would say it depends on what you can justify.  I asked for 25% more start-up at the R1 that hired me and got it, mostly because I provided a detailed budget on what the money would go toward, and even linked this to a separate document detailing start-up projects (then in the budget each item had a column saying the item would be used for project x,y,z).  The director complemented me on the level of detail and even rounded up my request a bit. For salary, their was little room for negotiation as our department is pretty committed to having all incoming faculty start at the same level, so there is no risk of asnimosity, I suppose. Probably was a little wiggle room there, but I chose to focus on getting more cash start-up, which in the end I can use for some summer salary anyhow.   8) On startup 7 friends last year got R01 jobs.  On all of them the startup seemed to be limited by what they asked for.  The candidate who asked for 500k got 400-500k and the candidate that asked for 1.2 million got a truckload (but not that total).  It doesn't hurt to start high, especially if you suggest that very high price tag equipment can be shared across the school.   At SLACs one friend made them jumpy by asking for another 20k, and they said later they feared he was turning them down for and R01. I would  make it very clear that you are genuinely interested in the SLAC, teaching, and undergrad research when you ask them to up the package.  Unless of course you are pitting two SLACs against each other and then they should feel like they can play ball. ",NA,NA,NA,"Is there an internal candidate? 1) Is the answer ever ""yes, don't bother""? In other words, why bother asking on here? 2) There are many instances where the department has a preferred candidate or an internal candidate but if you don't apply, how would you know? In any case, if you are invited for an interview and performed far better than the 'preferred' candidate, you might stand a good chance.  3) I've seen one internal just totally blow it.  Apply, and hope that department needs you instead.  4) Agree about applying, but I don't understand why so many people on here get angy about people asking if there are internal candidates. Not saying that 2 & 3 have done that here, but in past years people have often gotten hostile after this question comes up. OP) Absolutely no hostility intended by posing the question, and apologies if any were offended. My point was genuine curiosity - what has ever been gained by asking? I would agree with 2 & 3 - go for it. In some types of places, you may be up against an internal candidate, but don't make the decision for the SC by not applying at all. 5) this can be an offensive question, as it can suggest the SC has cooked the books, or is otherwise trying to get around HR rules. Just don't ask (well, except maybe anonymously on here). I was in the middle of an interview at a very prestgious R1 when an offhanded remark from a grad student about a simultaneous search in another department made me realize that there *was* a preferred candidate (that wasn't me). Actually a pair of them. I casually asked a question that could have been construed as strange but innocent, but the grad student was savvy and took my drift, immediately froze, clearly thinking to themselves ""oh, shit, he knows! what do I say..."" thus revealing that my hunch was correct, leading to my knowing grin of ""I know you know I know"". Nothing more needed to be said, so I changed the topic. I then got the full scoop much later at a meeting, but during the rest of the interview there was ZERO reason for me to bring it up. There is no good it can do you. 6) Sometimes there's an internal candidate around whom the job might even have been written, but also internal friction over this person's desirability. A strong external candidate can still win in that case.","Just saw that a job from last year went to someone who is still a PhD candidate. Even when the job ad says ""Applicants must have a PhD degree and relevant post-doctoral experience in any contemporary discipline related to animal biology"" but instead they hired someone who is basically in an expert in human anatomy. Like, if that is what they wanted, just SAY IN IN THE EFFIN AD and don't waste our time. 2) Word of advice, don't follow up who was hired over you...it will just make you pissed off and there's nothing you can do about it at this point. x2 3) Is it possible that these are different hires? People often defer jobs, so it's hard to track unless there is internal information.  4) It is  stupid that job ads don't match what the search committee chooses but it happens all the time.  Often the deans suggest hiring for a specific area but faculty pretend there were no qualified applications and just hire the person they wanted.  People also purposefully choose candidates with lesser CVs because they are terrified of being turned down.  With 150-300 applicants for most jobs ""no one qualified"" is inexcusible.  Making other candidates' career success subject to internal politics is ridiculous and anti-scientific.  It sucks, but keep going and hope you find a committee  that is fair minded. 5) I have served on search committees at regional state schools, R1s, and R2s. I have only ever seen 100+ applications for the R1 advertisements. Most pools are well under 100 applicants. From my experience, most regionals range from around 20 (cell and molecular biology positions) to around 60 (ecology and evolutionary biology positions). Still, your point is understood. Even at smaller schools, the pool for ecology and evolutionary biology positions is still large enough to try to get the best candidate available that meets the job description. 6) From someone who has been on four recent search committees at a SLAC (none targetting ecology hires but some attracting ecologist applicants), only one search netted fewer than 100 applicants (max 140).","Real estate 1) Do most on-site interviews include meeting with a local real estate agent? A friend told me about their experience and it was new to me. Just wondering aloud. 2) From my one interview, I didn’t talk to an agent but was given information on the housing market. 3) I have never met with a real estate agent on an interview. That seems like a topic for a subsequent visit. Is someone on the search committee related to this real estate agent? That seems weird.  4) No. The SC chair has taken me around town to see neighborhoods but I have never heard of meeting with a realtor.  I could maybe see this in extremely tight/unusual markets - I had an interview overseas (SE Asia) where I was given the opportunity to visit a local development for some perspective. 5) I've heard of this in places that have an unusual housing market where the SC is worried about presenting it as liveable (because of price, schools, crime, commute, etc), but I don't think it is common. 6) echo #5. Almost all second visits (with offer) schedule meeting with estate agents though. 7) Mostly same experience; on campus interview, SC members talked generally about housing market, and one mentioned a specific realtor they'd worked with, but did not meet directly 8) Yes, I was driven around by a real estate agent during one interview. Small town, definitely not a tight market. Actually a nice break from the interview itself! x2 9) Sat on 2 SCs as grad rep and our finalists had real estate agent visits scheduled. It was as much about the housing as about having someone else show them around town. Important if you go on tour with real estate agent to realize you are still being interviewed.

That just seems like a waste of time for my letter-writers. The search committees could at least make their long list, which will likely be based on CL, CV, and Research Statement, before requesting letters of recommendation. 2) This gets discussed on here every year and I absolutely agree with you. The counter argument that always gets brought up is that it is much easier for the search committee to have everything on hand to begin with so that they can go right from their first cut to making evaluations rather than waiting another 2-3 weeks for letters to come in. I understand the perspective, but it still seems like an awful lot of extra work for everyone in the system just to avoid a couple weeks in what is already a months long process.  3) I totally agree, and it seems like there are more jobs this year that require letters than normal!!  Not that I've actually gone back and compared with actual numbers. 4) A friend who has served on several search committees actually looks at letters from the start, and uses them to make decisions about the long list. 5) My students & postdocs are looking for jobs so I have to send letters.  After the first one (or the first update for a new year), it's trivial to send.  No biggie! 6) I agree with #5. Also some faculty in search committee prefers to read reference letters before making the long/short-list. 7) 5 & 6, I'm glad you have that attitude but it definitely is not universal. Lots of advisors get annoyed with submitting tons of letters and it creates a ton of work coordinating and checking that all letters were submitted, especially if some of your writers are not totally reliable. I agree that each individual letter is trivial to submit, but if you have several students on the market and each is applying to 20+ jobs with three letters per job it actually creates a lot of work. As for reading letters up front, I can see the argument that people might get kicked off of the long-short list if their letters are not as strong as the other materials, but I find it hard to imagine that people who don't stack up in other ways (publications, research statement, etc) would get bumped up just by virtue of having strong letter writers. It'd be easy enough to weed out those with weak letters in the next round. Besides, there is evidence that letters are often the thing that contributes most to biased selection because of, for example, gendered language and paying attention to the name of the letter writer more than the quality of the applicant (the old boy's network). Those types of biases are most pronounced when quickly scanning applications and making instant assessments, as is done in the first pass of a job search when there are many applications to read and less time to critically evaluate each one.  8) #2 has a key insight: it's often to save time down the road rather than do the initial triage. 9) It sucks and I wish committes would stop requesting this but it's not going to happen - #5&6 - yes, it's not that hard but if you have a letter writer that thinks it is (i.e., runs a very large lab or has become a busy administrator) then the candidate is stuck with leaving them off their list (which can look odd if it was your supervisor) or not getting letters in. >50% of my applications end up missing a letter - some committees are nice and will request it later, some committees might not even see my application if it is deemed incomplete.10) SC member here-- remember, the search is not about you, it is about the department doing the hiring. Asking for letters after the app deadline makes for more meetings and it can, depending on how insane one's HR department is, lengthen the already convoluted search process by several weeks. Searches try to set timelines, and factor in things like when winter break will fall (since this slooows things down).  The timeline to *getting the job ad approved by the admins* can itself be a nightmare. Your request, although reasonable, often cannot be accomondated by the timeline. Sorry! 11) #10, I believe you that it is hard to do this at some places, but plenty of schools DO wait to request letters until they have a short list, so clearly it is possible.12) I interviewed for a position in the UK and they reqested letters after all of the candidates interviewed! 13) I work at a place that is bureacratically inept when it comes to hiring, too, but I agree with 11 - it obviously can be done where there is the will to do it. Nothing wrong with asking search committees to make things easier for everyone.14) #10 here.  #11, #13... you have a rather optomistic view of the world.  If you get a job at an enormous state school you will get a taste for how thick the beuracray can be.  A lot of the rules were presumably well-intentioned, or was at some point in the past, but their existance completely ties the hands of the SC, Department, and college. Our school is usually one of the very last to advertise positions, year in and year out, due to this beuracracy, and so the last thing a SC wants to do is lengthen the process... being last risks that we will miss out on the very best candidates. 13) There's nothing inherently optimistic about noting that Florida, Wisconsin, and Washington can run a search without requiring letters up front. I'm more curious about why some can. 15) #9 again. I agree with #10, it is usually done by SC to speed this up because of the bottleneck at HR - that's why we complain about it every year and it never changes. Smaller schools and private schools are often better in this respect. While I hate that letters are requested, I've also done hires through HR at several university and understand what a cluster this often is. 16) Letter writer here. I loathe letter requests at the outset, especially when the jobs are clearly getting or going to get 100+ applications. The whole process strikes me as a totally unnecessary workload from an antiquated system that only benefits the searching school. The list makes considerably more sense given the market.","I'm so excited that my already really stressful job application season has been further complicated by being displaced by hurricane Harvey.

Im okay. I have temporary housing and I was able to get the majority of my really important belongings up above the waterline, so its more the emotional and physical stress thats not putting me in a good headspace to put together application packets. 4) Glad to hear you're safe.

(x3)"," 1) Do folks actually use this jobs Wiki to find jobs?  I assumed it was more of a way to check on the status of a search and to discuss and vent about various topics, which is why yelling at others for posting jobs after the deadline seems lame to me.  I don't think it's the job of the OP's to make sure you found the job prior to its deadline.  Some add jobs as they submit applications, which may very well be the last day to submit an application.  2) Perhaps someone could add links to the most frequently used sites for finding jobs 3) As I understand the spirit of this wiki, you should post jobs once you know they exist, rather than waiting until you submit an applicaiton. This is part of information sharing as well - jobs get posted in lots of different places, and while we all check various sites, it's hard to cach everything. If you want to benefit from other people sharing info, you should be willing to do it too, at all stages. None of this is about ""the job"" of a poster - it's participating in a community where everyone benefits everyone else. I think it's reasonable to find it annoying if people post jobs after the deadline. x9  4) If you know the job exists and you apply for it ahead of time, and you wait for the deadline to pass before you post it here because you want to avoid alerting the competition to the posting while simultaneously benefiting from the ""any updates?"" aspect of the community, then you're kind of a selfish scumbag. 5) Several of the jobs that I applied to this year I saw only on the wiki, and not on Ecolog or other (smaller) job boards that I monitor.",NA,"replying to email from SC regarding LOR requests? When committee members notify you that they requested LOR from your referees, should we reply to the email with a ""thanks"" or something like that? I got an email from them so not an automated email saying that my letters were requested. 2) Absolutely write an email! If they didn't send you a ""Dear applicant, thank you for your interest..."" but a ""Hey Johanna, I'm just writing to let you know that..."" then absolutely positively definitely reply! Keep it extremely short, say you're looking forward and so on. Be sincere and brief.",NA,"Previous and current work vs future work? I am applying to a place which would be my top choice. I worked there for a few years and I know some of the people in the search committee. However, I'm not a perfect fit for the position. My question is, do search committees look at your previous and current work only? Or will they consider your future work ideas and research potential?   2) SCs will consider your future work ideas, but probably less than your demonstrated performance. You'll need to make a very convincing case that it's an exciting direction and that you have well thought out plans to move that way.  Research potential is one of those things that everyone feels they have plenty of.  How can you convince the SC that you have more than any other candidate? 3) To add - the current work is a good indicator of demonstrated performance, however, I have also seen folks with less prior performance (i.e. fewer pubs, etc) get selected because of better fit to what the department is looking for. "
NA,"Fitting in The most common bit of advice for getting a job (at least a R1) is to publish, publish, publish. I've been hearing this most of my undergrad, grad, and postdoc career from tenured and TT faculty that I've interacted with at top-notch programs. But, I've noticed that a lot of the people getting offers and jobs this past year (in particular) don't have a very impressive pub record. Again this is my sole observation however, a couple of postdoc friends can confirm. I know of a lot of good applicants with outstanding pub records and grants who are not getting offers, or even interviews.  I know what ultimately determines who gets an offer and who doesn't is all about ""the fit"" or ""fitting in"" to a particular department. But, seriously when an applicant who has 30+ good pubs and over 300K in grants is getting shafted in interviews over applicants with under 10 pubs, there's something wrong with the system...  What are your thoughts? Anyone experiencing the same?   (1) Hiring is a social phenom, just like getting grants. If you have pals of pals on the committee or if your research will in some way help a committee member, guess what! you have more of a chance. Likewise if you have a ""pedigree"" and the things I list above (particularly if your letter writers have a great resume and they are known by the committee) then you also have a better chance, regardless of your record, so long as it passes some minimal standard. That said, there are a few occasions, especially when jobs are written for specific talents, that a committee is looking for a certain person who will hit a research topic right on or will be very well suited for teaching needed classes. Here again, the person with the best fit, and not necessarily the best resume will be selected. In either case, these result in many cases of someone who is not ""the best"" actually getting the job. (2) I agree that number of publications clearly matters but if many pubs have multiple authors and the applicant isn't the first or second author, they may be disregarded as not really contributing to the work. Or the work may not be viewed as independent enough from the main advisor's research program asR1s want to make sure the candidate can establish a strong, indpendent program. (3) About having pals on the committee, etc. every case where I knew somebody on the SC, that member recused themselves from my case, so it doesn't always help. That being said, I would like to bring to your attention that the hiring is done by a Committee. that should be enough to tell you not to expect any level of logic in the process... (4) Why do you assume something is wrong with ""the system""? Maybe you've misidentified what the purpose of the system is. Even discounting the benefits of pals on the committee, etc., what's wrong with a school deciding that they want a candidate whose research fills out their needs or interests, who is personable, etc.? All else being equal, perhaps pubs and grants should matter most...but all else is NEVER equal! 5) What is strange about the described situation to me is that people with fewer pubs etc. would make the first cut over those with more. I can certainly see, and understand, choosing someone with fewer pubs/grants after meeting them. People are very different than CVs and the SC has to like the people and feel good about them. But, I am always surprised when someone without many pubs/grants on paper gets selected early in the process, because at that point there is no influence of personality. (6) See 1, above. Also, you may be overestimating how a committee views papers. Is it just about numbers and journals? Or do your papers push the field, do you stand out as a voice of reason, or are you just one of hundreds publishing on the same ol' thing as everyone else, only in a higher impact journal? Unfortunately, that is not for you to decide. You are on the outside looking in. Welcome to academia! 7) Well, right, of course. But don't we all think we are doing important work, pushing the field, being unique and exciting? I think that is why the academic job search is so heartrending at times. We believe what we do is cool and important, we get it published in high impact journals which supports this belief, and then it is really tough when it seems other people (i.e. SCs) don't appear to agree. (8) SCs take a lot into account beyond your CV. If you have 30 pubs and don't tell a good story in your letter or research statement, you may not grab the attention of a SC. Also remember that teaching experience and philosophy is important, especially at SLACs.

(9) As people note above, not all pubs are created equal. Also, I tend to look at publication rate, not total number of pubs. Better to get a rising star than someone who has been around a long time, like fruit transforming into really bad wine! (10) There are also many very excellent researchers at R1/Tier 1 institutions (and elsewhere) with low quantity (and/or rate) of publications but exceptionally high impact research. 11) I think what the original post was getting at, was not at the vagaries of search committee behavior, but at the advice that most of us get in grad. school, which is publish lots of good papers and you will get a job. However, once we hit the job market, many of us get disappointed because we buy into this advice and then don't get any interviews/job offers. We all know what the problem is here: there are way too many talented postdocs out there and not enough jobs. When searches get 400+ applications, it is easy to see this problem. Note that articles have been written about this in the New York Times and a recent issue of Science Mag. However, most faculty will not acknowledge this problem, because they are interested in getting lots of grad. students and postdocs to populate their labs (which helps them get tenure). How long will it be when the norm is to do 3-4 postdocs before getting a job? Remember that doing 1 postdoc or no postdoc was good enough 10-15 years ago. As pointed out in the NYT article, there is something ""wrong with the system"" in that universities are producing way too many PhDs than are needed for the number of jobs available. Just stating reality here. With that said, good luck to everyone on the market! 12) I think lot of things matter and agree with 9 above that rate probably matters more than total number but ""fruit rotting on the vine""? seriously stop being an anus hole and realize you're talking about human beings - penis head 13) OK, maybe that was a bit harsh so I rephrased that.14) Guess I am just your friendly fruit rotting on a vine. (14) me too, must be another rotting grape. (15) Young grape, plump, delicious grape, but starting to rot here. The flip side to doing 3-4 postdocs is that in many cases, it acts as red flag to SC's. ""Why can't this post-doc get a job?"" ""He/she must be a jerk or something"" We're screwed either way. Too little experience, we don't make the cut, too much and rotting fruit!. I understand where you're coming from OP. I've seen it all too much! (16) grape? I must be a raisin by now ! A victim of my own success. (17) If I understand #11 correctly, you are blaming PhD advisors and grad schools for producing too many new PhD's. I'd go further and blame the parents for having us all in the first place. Afterall, it's not like there's major labor shortage in any of the professions right now. What would all us talented kids do had we not gotten into grad school for ecol/evol? Forgive me if I can't work up an enthusiasm for being a nurse or engineer. (come to think of it, I started undergrad as a pre-vet major, and gave that dream up because vet schools are extrememly competitive to enter.) The bottom line is that when you have so many ppl in the talent pool, something needs to be done to create jobs. Perhaps we in academia should behave more like those in the manufacturing job sector, blame outsourcing and demand that the government create more jobs for us. 18) I also wonder for the ""great"" people who applied to every job out there - did they take the time to tailor the application to the job/department/college or just send out a ""standard"" packet? If a candidate had > credentials but made no attempt to make a compelling packet specific to the job, I would be inclined (as a SC) to dump it. Especially if there are 400 applications and 100 tried to tailor the application. Just my thoughts. (19) I am not one of the ""great"" people, but I did apply to a ton of jobs. And no, I didn't tailor the application much for different places. I just wrote a general letter that would fit a lot of different places. It may have hurt me at some places, I suppose, but the places where I've had a positive response are ones where I genuinely fit fairly well.

You know when you know sort of thing. 3) Or sometimes you never hear! #ghosting  4) Think how long it takes you to get 3-5 profs together for a meeting. Now imagine doing that 2-3 times.  It will be months.  Shorter if there is pressure to decide quickly, longer if a committee member travels a ton. 5) Search committes often have to report to the full faculty too, which slows things down. So day 1 search committee meets to reduce the list to a short list, then perhaps they meet a couple weeks later once letters are requested, then wait two more weeks to meet with full faculty to decide list of phone interviews, then schedule those, then afterwords meet a week later to cut that down, then go back to the full faculty to agree with the decision to invite, etc. You can see how long it can take.6) +1, and now imagine what it looks like if it is a college or interdepartmental search requiring coordination between multiple departments!  We had interviews 5 months after apps were due last year.  Ugh! 7) In a search last year we narrowed a pool of 200 applicants to the interview list in about 3-4 weeks; however after that list was made, it had to go through various levels of bureaucratic administrative approval. In the end we were able to contact candidates about 6 weeks after the application deadline. 8) At our R1, we want to beat other schools to the ""better fit"" candidates, and so we turn stuff around real quick. We make decisions the week that applications close, we invite within 2 weeks, and try to get offers done before winter break. That way, if we have to try again in Spring, we can. Never sure if we get a line next year if fail this year. Having been at more lib art school too. Very different there. Process takes months, because faculty are teaching and can only move things forward once per week.","1) Maybe something others can help me understand. Why do committees look more at the number of papers than actual number of citations on first author papers? It sounds completely illogical when these numbers have become so easy to access. Last year I applied to a position that ended up being offered to a candidate that had litterally 40 times less citations than I have. How can this be right?  2) Don't know but it sucks, especially if it's a schmoozy hire.  More committees are asking for google scholar links. It helps them see the citation counts better.  Include your scholar link at the end of the cover letter or in the CV. 3) Women's papers get cited less than men's. In some fields, citations accrue faster (my most-cited paper is a phylogeny). Recent papers won't yet have accumulated citations. 4) If you want fast citations, get a bunch of coauthors with Twitter followers & write a methods paper ;) 5) Also, lots of citations doesn't always mean high quality of research. 6) I've been beaten by people with less papers and less citations but a better upward trajectory in both. It's all about what they are projecting you to do in the future. If you have an exciting research program and your numbers are trending up (citations and publications) every year, you can easily beat people with better raw numbers in total. I flat-lined many years ago. I still publish a lot but the quantity has not increased. My papers still get cited a lot but not much more than previous years. I'm basically a dead fish in the water. I can get the job done, but you basically know what you get when you hire me versus a candidate with an upward trajectory with only the sky as the limit. Basically, ""trending"" can be really important.   7)  Sitting on committees, I much prefer original data papers with thoughtful and robust designs over reviews and opinion ... though they get few citations, as they suggest to me more scientific originality that will payoff in the long-run of a career. 8)  Reivew papers/citations don't count much in most of the R1 universities, although the effort is appreciated. 9) #8, I emphatically disagree.  WHen I'm on a SC, if an applicant has a well-written review it shows that they understand where the field is and where it is moving. A good review is well cited because it is influential. 10) #8 here. A review article can be very influential and imporant for science and education. I am just saying my experience (phd, postdoc, and now SC) suggests my field does not count much on reviews. Without strong support of data driven publications, one will not get intervews in these places (may be other places that appreciate such effort). I agree that good reviews can have positive impact though. I know postdocs who published high impact reviews with their grad and postdoc advisors and their citations are >1000/2000, and they are not getting more interviews than people who have 300 citations. 11) Original poster here. 90% of my citations are on my original research so I do not think the disctinction between reviews/not reviews applies. I have now ~400 citations, but see people with less than 50 at similar career point getting the jobs and I just cannot understand it. As for the discussion around the promise of some applicants, past performamce predicts future performance. So, the fact is that most applicants as promising as they look with few citations will still have few citations in the future.","All comments deleted from U Washington job 1) There was useful information there. I assume most of these deletions are accidental, but they are happening worryingly frequently. Please be careful when editing! The information is valuable and though some comments can be restored, we don't want to create even more work for our wonderful volunteer admin.  2) The comments were filling up an entire screen, which makes it impossible to view the rest of the spreadsheet. Not everyone applied to this job. 3) #1 here. The fact that there were some unhelpful comments doesn't mean that the entire discussion was worth removing. There were several useful ones containing information on the number of applicants and the state of the search. It may have interrupted your scrolling (and I sympathize with that) but many people seem to have found them useful, so it's inconsiderate to delete it all. One possible compromise would be to summarise the existing info there, and then move the previous block to the discussion tab. 4) And now again the latest summary has been entirely deleted. Honest question to whomever is doing this: is it just because it's occupying screen real estate for you? 5) I am not the deleter, and I don't agree with this action. However, let's all try to discuss/vent in other tabs (e.g., here) and add comments to the ""Faculty Jobs tab"" only when they are really useful. The most recent comments deleted from the UWA space were just about venting because comments are deleted. This is annoying for people (like me) that are genuinly looking for updates ABOUT THE JOB, and not about your feelings on other people's actions. 6) #4 here. @5 I agree in general, but the most recent comment also had an update on the job and a useful link. 7) Again #5, yes @6, I am totally with you. There's someone or more than one who is recently having fun in deleting comments. This is way more annoying than the space occupied by useless comments.  x2 8) Everyone is worked up about a job where the chance is barely not zero. 1000 applicants for one position. I'd ignore everything until they contact you. There is nothing you can do. 9) Supposedly they are hiring up to 5 positions. So the 'chance' by this calculation is about the same as for most other jobs on here (1200/5 ~ 2-300/1). x2 10) @8, presumably the people who are still following the UW job are in the remaining 100, and they have the right to not have all the useful stuff about the job deleted x2 11) Move, don't delete. x3 12) Even better, just don't change previous comments. leave them. ignore them if you need to. or put in a request for the moderator to move it. your precious unicorn rainbow screen space is not a reason to delete comments. it's super easy to navigate the spreadsheet, even if one cell is very large. just scroll down. deleting comments in a forum like this is the worst kind of participation. x3",NA,"Anon Quals Could we create a new anon quals tab (like the one on last year's job spreadsheet)?

This way they know more are willing if needed and may even contact them. 5) I would pick the three best letter writers. in my experience in reviewing applications, having three very strong, personal letters is better than having 3 awesome letters + 2 less personal letters-- those extra letters just dilute your file in some cases; keep in mind that search committee members are typically skimming files initially, so you only want amazing stuff in your file. 6) Know that some online application systems won't allow you to submit more than 3 letters if that is the number the advertisement requested.

We're brought up in this field believing that we MUST have several postdocs and then a prestigious R1 tenured position, but there are other things out there, too. Somehow I feel like the Anon Quals page mostly supports the R1 race, and that other folks should represent. 3) Yup. I came out of a good program, and that page is not representative. 4) I have a different take on the Anon Quals page- it allows you to see that even candidate with few publications, no grants, or little teaching experience will still get interviews and offers. In the end, ""fit"" matters a lot, and your personality during the interview is crucial. Try not to be discouraged, especially if it's your first time on the job market. 5) Also remember that the Anon page doesn't include journals that you've published in.  I know people with 6 publications who get a ton of interviews because their papers are in great journals whereas others have 20+ pubs but in ""low- mid- tiered"" journals who hear nothing.  Take this page with a grain of salt. 6) Also variable among fields. Just do your thing and move forward. 7) I definitely panicked a bit when I first looked at the Anon Quals page, because I don't think I measure up. But commenter #5 is right. You don't know how many of those with 20 pubs have 19 of their pubs in Journal of Southwestern Fisheries. 8) On the flip side,  even if you do have a bunch of papers in tiny, regional journal whatever, don't feel too bummed out either - especially if you're applying to a specialty position in that field or your research was very undergraduate-mentee heavy. 9) I'm not sure I understand the point of the Anon Quals page, just to see who gets interviews? 10) Literally everyone I know who got R1 jobs last year would not be considered superstars based on their 'anon quals' metrics. So yeah, take it with a grain of salt. 11) I got a TT job last year and followed this board heavily (still check in once in a while).  I have one of the lowest packages on the negotiations page.

My interview had no drama, they just went for a senior hire.  News flash:two years later I'd figured out I didn't get the job.  At least have the decency to be polite.","Cover letter lengths I’ve received a range of opinions about the ideal length for the cover letter: I seen some letters that are a *packed* two pages, while other advice I’ve heard suggests never more than a single page. I figured gathering some data might be useful to others as a guideline in the future. So, paste in the comments how many words you used in a recent cover letter and I’ll tabulate the results!  2)  I always start my cover letters with ""Dear such and such, I seen your job listing for yadda, yadda, yadda""  3) I've had variable lengths, but the more successful ones have been longer, ~700 words.  That's about a page and a half with letterhead. 4) 1078 words 5) page length. open r, paste this: rnorm(10000, mean = 2, sd = 1) 4) 1 page, ~500 words, have had several interviews 5) 860 words 6) Depending on the position 680-780 words x2 7) SC member here, our current search most letters are 1-2 pages long. Anything beyond 2 pages I skim and assume they're repeating research statement 8) 600 words 9) 415 words (1 page) 10) 533 words (1 page) and was able to land one on campus interview at a major R1 so far. 11) One to 1.5 pages is optimal. 12) 938 words: one paragraph on who I am, one paragraph on my research, one paragraph on my teaching, one paragraph on how I would involve students in research, one paragraph on my quantitative skills, one paragraph on diversity mixed with a sign-off/thank you...I have no idea what to cut!! 13) @12, I think you could put quantitative skills into the research and teaching paragraphs, unless the job is specifically for a quantitative ecologist #1/OP Looks like both the mean and median is around 710 words. I think this will be a useful target for our colleagues! Thanks very much for the response. 14) 1 pg, ~550 words, had skype/on-campus interviews. 15) 1.5-2 pages, depending on the position.

Tell the search committee how you mean the min and preferred qualifications listed, the department, location, type of institution etc.  Don't send form letters or letters that are not modified to match a specific position.  I have served on many, many searches and I will tell you that a well-crafted cover letter is commonly the difference between adding to the long list (phone interview) vs. ""meh"" rating by the commity.

If no name is listed, then just address to Chair of the Search Committee. 3) Or ""Search Committee"" 4) you learn when you receive your schedule for your on-campus interview 5) Address ""Dear chair & members of the search committee.""","Just submitted my first faculty application ever - it was 21 pages long and it took a really long time to tailor it to the ad. Looking at the % success rate in the TotalToTenureTrack tab, it feels like applying is not even worth the effort. I should just be writing papers instead. I am also just grumpy that it takes this much time to apply. What other profession requires this much info from their job applicants? I am bummed and I haven't even really begun to apply in the numbers that I would need to get one offer (about 35:1 average according to the TotalToTT tab). I secretely want to start a y. 2) 21 pages?! Bloody hell. I reckon my packages have been 10 pages tops (2 for cover, 2 for teaching, 2 for research, 4-5 for CV). After conferring with many a search chair, it seems CV (# papers and where they go) are the preemminent factor leading to the short list, followed by letters of rec. Only once has a committee brought up my teaching. 3) My package: 1 page cover letter, 3 pages research, 1 teaching, 4 CV. If someone has referred to something about teaching during an interview, it has always been mentioned in the cover letter, not the teaching statement itself, so I suspect no one really pays much attention to it. I only ever tailor the cover letter. 4) IMO, teaching statement is worthless. I've served on numerous committees and I never look at it. However, other people on committees I have served do look at the teaching statement and come up with arbitrary scoring based on the teaching statement. My standard packet: 1 page cover, 2 page research, 1 page teaching, and 16+ page CV (I'm a full prof looking to move into at an associate level position at a better university, so my CV is a little deeper than typical).  5) If you go over page limits by 1-2, people will roll their eyes but still not kick you out of the running.  Over by 10 pages?  A lot of people will take it as a sign you don't know the landscape and cannot follow directions.   You better be pretty friggin awesome for them to get past that. 6) In some cases, if your documents get too long, people will assume you can't get your point across concisely. There are unwritten rules for different fields. 7) I'd wager that the majority of OP's 21 pages were writing samples  8) I hope so, #7. 9) During a recent search at an R1, one of the shortlisted (though not interviewed) candidates had a 12-page research statement. Totally outrageous. 10) That's not totally outrageous. Some people will submit NSF-type proposals. People every year will get jobs with long research statements. I wouldn't say that they are the majority, but I have seen it happen at least twice at an R1. It really just depends on the search committee. 11) I recommend putting together a ""modular"" package.  A: Have a cover letter that has the stuff that isn't going to change much (like your broad research interests) well-worded, and sections that you can update to fit the position (like who at the institution you could imagine collaborating with).  B: Write 2-3 versions each of teaching and research statement (I had one that emphasized my ecological interests, one that emphasized evolution, one that emphasized computational).  The CV will be the same, of course, and your reference list will only change a little.  I went through two years of applications.  The first I submitted about 60 total faculty & postdoc applications, got two faculty and two postdoc interviews, and one faculty & one postdoc offer.  I took the postdoc.  The second I submitted about 30 faculty applications, got an offer, and accepted.  Having that package ready to go was what made it possible!","Contacting search committee after on campus So...is it ever appropriate to contact the search committee again? I was told I would be notified either way around the begining of the month and ..... 2) if you were told around the beginning of the month then my advice is to wait at least a week. At that point I don't think it would be out of line to contact them just to see what's up. 3) I've been told it's never to your benefit to contact them, and it can sometimes come across as a negative.  4) only contact them once you have other offers and need to make a decision.  5) remember that things almost always take longer than expected (and very rarely shorter).  If someone told you an exact date by which they'd have a decision, they were probably being optomistic. After a few weeks go by, hearing nothing likely means they have offered to someone else.  You can then hope that you're #2 and that #1 does not accept.  This can take months. 6) My motto is: no news = bad news, until it is a good news. I am trying to forget any positive feedback, unless I get a job offer. OP) They called and I didn't get it. This blows.",NA,"Answering the question, ""Are you legally authorized to work in the country to which you are applying?"" I'm a Canadian citizen applying for academic jobs in the US. I currently am in the states on a student visa and do not have a green card or work visa. I have been answering this question (and variations of it) as ""no"" because I would need a visa to work in the US. My advisor (also a Canadian, and in a similar position when he was looking for jobs) was shocked that I was answering ""no"" and said he always wrote ""yes"". What are your thoughts? 2) I'm also on a student visa in the US with OPT STEM and I am saying yes. I think those questions refer to people that cannot get into the immigration system, such as people who are undocumented or from ""banned countries"" (maybe?). The way I think about it is that I am authorized to work legally right now, I would just requiere sponsorship in the future. 3) I am also Canadian and when applying to jobs in the US, I answered 'yes' to this question (I also happened to be in the US on a J1 visa as a postdoc). I would interpret a 'no' answer as you could not become legally authorized. 4) I am Canadian, and have applied for jobs on both J1 and H-1B. I always answer yes, because it seems possible that a search could dismiss you out of hand for answering no (and those questions existed before the travel bans). However I did once get to campus interview for a position that required a green card, where they did NOT ask the question. That really sucked, finding that out literally in the meeting with the dean. 5) What about when they ask if you will need sponsorship in the future (which I saw a couple of time)? It seems that one could also be use against you... 6) It could be used against unfortunately, but I still answer with the truth, which is a ""yes I will need sponsorship"". I don't want to spend time preparing for interviews in places where they won't be willing to sponsor me or that will not extend an offer because they don't want to spend ""extra"" on me.  7) I always say yes. I am on a student visa and saying no would put me on a huge disadvantage, if they offer me the job then they'll have to deal with sponsoring me, period. @5 I got asked this question one time on a campus visit by the chair of dep. I found it very odd and actually unapropriate to ask. I said I would need to apply for a work authorization, the conversation got very unconfortable. I didn't get the job. Are they allowed to ask you this question??? 8) Canadian currently in the US on a TN visa. I always answer 'yes' to both of these questions. Search committees just want the best person for the job and most departments wouldn't care about the extra little bit of paperwork invoved in hiring you (it's usually done by someone in HR anyway). 9) If you answered NO you can forget about those jobs. 8) #5 here, I had a similar situation as #7 During an interview with a chair of the department he asked me why I didn't have any major fellowships (i.e. EPA Star, NSF, etc), as if it was some major red flag which I think is ridiculous considering the super low funding rate, anyways, I avoided the question and told him that I had other fellowships (smaller ones for international students), and he said that all other candidates had at least one fellowship from a major US government organization. I then told him, ""I am not a US citizen and I don't qualify to apply to any of those major US fellowships"". He immedtiately changed the subject and of course I didn't get the job. I'm not saying me not being a US citizen influenced the outcome of the search, but I guess we'll never know.  10) OP here. Thanks everyone for your comments! I received a rejection from a school, but the notice came from HR and not someone in the department. I will contact them to ask if it was because of how I answered this question. This school's search is still ongoing so there's a chance that this might be the case. @7 I'm in that boat right now. I can't write or apply for anything because of my current position as a noncitizen and Canadian agencies won't fund me if I stay in the States. Anyway, I hope this conversation continues! I'm interested to hear more thoughts and experiences from other international candidates. 11) @8 I am almost positive that's the reason you and I didn't get the job, they put us in a corner with this question and honestly I think it should not be an allowed question. They sometimes even ask it through an indirect question, like asking why not federal funding. I also think they should be open to sponsor working permits, specially if they are so interested in diversity 12) I'm also a canuck, but i suspect most search committee/dean should be able to figure I'm not american (did all training until postdoc in canada and got nserc). Not saying this is the case for everyone, but still thinks some signs are obvious if you didnt want to sponsor people. Actually think it is more indication of a bad dean/search committee. FWIW, I actually got positive experience when interviewing once with the dean saying they recently hired canadians and that HR  was used to the process of sponsoring. I do feel that, as canadian, we start with one strike when answering the ""why here"" question. I had a member of a search committee asking me that explicitly during dinner (why in the usa instead of canada). 13) I'm on H1B (not canadian). I always answer YES to both questions (other question - do you need sponsorship now or in the future?). You are authorized to work if your employer is willing to sponsor. 14) IME R1 places have no problem with sponsoring H-1B and prepping the green card in the first year. It's R2 and otherwise, mainly because they have a much smaller/barely existent international student population, thus fewer HR people with the requisite experience. It's also pretty expensive, premium processing for H is now over 5k, and that's without spouse or green card. 15) FYI, HR person at a national lab told me in writing to answer YES to the legally authorized question, and that they will arrange sponsorship. Agree in my experience that R1s are happy and willing to sponsor and have done so for several faculty I know. 16) Geez, I wish I had seen this conversation earlier. I am also Canadian applying to jobs in the US and was advised by several people to answer NO since I don't have a current work permit. Ugh. ",NA,"Journal Impact Factors on CV? My advisor suggests putting journal impact factors on my CV for each publication as many SC member may not be familiar with the journals. Any thoughts? Is this common? 2) I don't think it is common in EEB (in the US anyway). I saw this exact question posed on twitter by a prominent EEB professor wondering what he should tell his advisees and the response was essentially a unanimous 'no'. Obviously not a scientific poll, but it did have a bunch of responses presumably by people who would be on search committees.   3) If they want that info google scholar is good for citations to the articles themselves. 4) When I see this, I think it looks tacky and says something about how the candidate views research & scholarship (same with posting h-index). 5) I think it is one of those things that does not make much difference either way. Last year, I did not have JIF on my CV and I was offered a job. This year, I have them on my CV and also mention some of my metrics in my cover letter and I have had two on-campus interviews. 6) I asked a letter writer of mine his thoughts on listing IF, and he said to take it off because most people he knew thought it was tacky. 7) Certainly comes off as tacky to me. x7 8) If you have 0 or very few publications in broadly well-respected journals, no listing of JIF is going to help. 9) @8 and if they are fancy enough journals, people will recognize them anyway.  10) when I was last on a search, some CVs had this and some didn't (just like some CV's mentioned how many times each paper had been cited).  I didn't think it looked tacky but it also didn't impress me much either. So: Meh. 11) Journal impact factor is poorly correlated with article level metrics, so I don't list JIF unless the instructions request it (which is rare). 12) Agree its not needed, and that it is poorly correlated with article level metrics, and isn't always meaningful.  For example, PLoS ONE has a relatively high impact factor, but I am sure most would agree its not a good journal, and the IF is driven mainly by the broad scope and sheer numbers of articles published, not the quality.  Plus, being the sole author of an Ecology paper probably says more about you than being one of 27 authors on a PNAS paper, for example."

(3) Weird--I didn't get an interview or a rejection letter. 4) They definitely have chosen the 4 finalist. 5) If you did not get an interview or rejection letter, likely means that you were highly rated (or at least acceptable to the search committee) but not high enough to get an interview.

You then 'upload' it to your application. 5) Thanks! 6) FWIW, I've also had an application this year where there was no option in the system to have it request letters from my referees; I contacted the chair of the search committee to confirm that I was actually supposed to upload letters myself, and he confirmed that this was what they wanted me to do.

Makes it even harder to contemplate going through the whole thing again this year...

Original poster here - WHY is this still so hard?? So many of us are in this position!! Especially for jobs in crappy cities/towns, this could be an easy way to get TWO great people instead of one!  4) One of the biggest inefficiencies is that second place to someone who accepted gets you absolutely nothing.","FOIA to see job finalists and credentials Has anyone tried this route to obtain names of candidates receiving in-person interviews at U.S. public universities? Is this information that a University has to legally provide or it protected? 2) I imagine it could only work at public universities, if it would work at all. Why would you even want to do it though? 3) I'm guessing such a request would reasonably fall under FOIA ""Exemption 6: Information that, if disclosed, would invade another individual's personal privacy."" So I doubt an HR department would release it. 4) That's a bit creepy. Is it not sufficient to look at published seminar schedules? x6 5) You can request anything you want, but without a good reason, there's no obligation through FOIA. For your sake and everyone else's, please don't do this. x7 6) Some states, such as Florida, are legally required to post their job candidates whereas other states protect one's privacy. 7) In response to #5, actually, FOIA requires public entities to allow you to look at anything you want, as long as it doesn't qualify for one of nine exemptions. A public employee does not have the right to deny access to public records unless those records qualify as exempt. You don't need to give a reason. You don't need to show ID. And you don't need to put your request in writing. 8) Yes, these records are available under 7 (1)(c) of FOIA. It would take forever, and probably require arbitration from a PAC, and two major things stand in your way - 1. You likely don’t have a legitimate interest in disclosure, and 2) there is no real public interest in disclosure. Finally, most public universities are not required to comply under FOIA because they are regarded differently than tratitional state and federal agencies. One last note, usually when people tell you NOT to request information under FOIA, you should. Don‘t let people discourage you from doing it - there have been a lot of SC commentors on the board this year, and they probably don‘t want you diggng around. I am sure that the vast majority or even all of them have great intentions, but I would be very surprised if, when someone peeked behind the curtain on some of these searches, they ran efficiently and logically, completely devoid of incompetance. 9) #4 here. Not connected to a SC in any capacity. We already know that ""meritocracy"" doesn't decide who gets hired, so what's the point in ""exposing"" subjectivity in the search process? 10) Right, anyone trying to expose whatever may happen in a search via FOI request isn't likely to benefit from it, except in a Trumpian watch the world burn sense. 11)  I just wait until the fall to see who got my job on their faculty website and then I bitch about how much better I am.  ;)  12) Funny that this actually happened to me. The HR called after I had signed a contract and asked if they could release my name. I said sure since I had already signed the contract. HR called back the next day and said they had decided against it because I wasn't technically an employee yet. Therefore, folks had to wait until the fall to bitch about how much better they were! 13) Just ask someone from the department. Candidates would have given seminars so students, staff or faculty from that department would know. 14) Interesing, most of departments I care always list speaker names. Don't know why need the fuss about finding candidate list. 15) In the searches I've been on, we operate under fairly specific instructions about what types of documents we are required to keep (and submit to the AP office in the due course of the search) as documentation that the search was conducted fairly and in accordance with university policy.  And we do it, because the last thing we want is for our search to get cancelled because the SC screwed it up, and then for the FTE to go to another department and we keep shrinking while the cell-smasher departments keep growing. The purpose, in part, is to be prepared just in case there is a lawsuit from someone who wasn't offered the job. I imagine every single document that is saved as a part of a search could be subject to FOIA-- committee notes, evaluation criteria, etc.  I also imagine the FOIA would take a while (months?  years?). Far easier to just ask.  Totally disagree with #8 encouraging FOIA, the reason to not ask is that all you do is make a bunch of paperwork for some poor overworked admin, dept chair, dean, sub dean, VP of academic personell, and so on. A rational SC wouldn't have anything to hide.  The reason to not poke around is the wasted time. Don't you have awesome papers to be writing instead? x5 16) to #15, I will buy overworked admin and possibly chair...but dean? I would probably be a professional golfer if I spent as much time on the links as my dean.  17) #15 here, yea at our university the sub-dean and dean sign off on all these things, and they're where the FTE comes from.

I think the analyses are kind of interesting to look at, but really flawed if you want to actually understand the system and they both give a veneer of understanding (even if the authors make lots of caveats) that I think are not helpful. A well designed study would actually follow cohorts chosen before any outcome metrics of interest are determined. Obviously that would take a lot longer and be a lot harder to do. 8) I'm glad you get that. Few people have pointed out the incredible bias in analyzing this data. The people that do tend to regularly work with survey data and understand it well. Instead, a lot of garbage analysis has been passed on as representing the true population of job seeking ecologists instead of the population the data represent... Ecology job seekers who post on a Google sheet + anyone else because the sheet is completely open. It's a shame. 9) So searches tend to receive over 100 applicants, yet somehow 15 applications suffice for the median applicant in this pool of respondents.

I can't imagine any SC looking at that information, anyway 3) I always fill them out, but try to spend as little time as possible.  I doubt anyone looks at that, but I do it just in case. 4) Thanks! 5) sounds like an HR thing. HR tends to like as few different forms as possible. Most SC will contact you and ask you to do that if you're on their short list and they need that stuff to move your app forward.  In fact, same for missing letters (if they were willing to overlook that). Other places, like my R1, HR won't let the SC ask you for a missing letter and will force the SC to drop you if letter is not in!","I don't know if this is exactly venting, but ""Applications from, or information about, female and minority candidates are especially encouraged."" from within the Harvard app seems so strangely phrased. Information about? Like I once knew a woman who would be good for this position? I feel like this is as close to Romney's 'binder for of women' as you can get in an HR doc.  2) No idea why they phrased it this way, but I know they had so few apps from women/minorities, they wanted people to suggest folks they can reach out to.  A sys bio search got fewer apps than expected because good candidates (and me too) decided not to apply.  That being said, I don't view Harvard as a supportive environment for anyone.  A lot of faculty seem too wrapped up in their own battles to support anyone else's career.  There's a reason a lot of us did not want to apply there.  Perhaps the department should consider the enviroment at the school if they really want to recruit good junior faculty. 3) The call is strange, since it seems to perfectly describe a female assistant prof already in the department. Only a few years ago did Harvard even begin promoting junior faculty from within their own ranks. 4) That actually makes sense - fits in with the history of no tenure and bringing in a new assistant prof to fill the old spot.  ","Other job wikis? Is there a job wiki for those applying for non-eco/evo jobs?  Like A&P gigs?  2) Not that I've found, I'd be interetested in A&P and maybe even some molecular-type stuff. There was a bio jobs wiki but it is not maintained like this one. AP) If someone wants to set up an adjacent, minimally overlapping site next year (one that won't split the userbase and render THIS site less useful), send me an email at justananonymouspotato at gmail.com and I'll give you some scripts. 4) Anonymous potato, thank you so very much for all the work you must do to make sure this works, and for doing so completely anonymously (as far as I know). You are awesome. x6",NA,"Alternatives to post-doc I am curious to know what types of positions people are taking while searching for a permanent job. I am currently in my second post-doc and have had little success on the job market after 4 years of applying. A third post-doc does not help me reach my career goal of landing a teaching-focused job. However, even getting a visiting assistant professor position to boost my teaching experiences seems very difficult in this current job market. Getting a third post-doc is probably the easiest and potentially my only option. Are others bouncing around through multiple post-docs or are they finding different positions? If so, what kind of alternative positions? 2) My first and current postdoc funding is going to end soon (this summer) and I've decided that doing another postdoc will not help me get a TT job so I'm going the VAP route too. I've been adjucting while on my postdoc to help get supplemental teaching experience. My PI is very nice for letting me do so. 3) My postdoc ends in 10 months. I have decided not to do another, and that this will be my last year looking for an academic job. I have been cruising - suprisingly successfully - though the state and local gov't scene. Actually hoping to get one of these jobs - it pays better and people work 40 hours a week. Doing a postdoc really opened my eyes to the true nature of academic research and I didn't like what I saw. 3) government jobs don't pay better than professorships at decent places  4) If you want a teaching focused job and haven't taught your own course you might consider a temp lecture job or course organizer/docent/preceptor.   They really want to see independent lectures as much as research.  They also want to see undergrad research done under your direction.   Those things got my last pdoc his job.  We just had to set up his position so he checked the right boxes.  Also, if it's been a long time submit at least a few apps where you switch up your rec letters.  Some people write better recs than others and a 'soft' rec could be hurting you whether intentional or not. 5) Responding to 3, I  just interviewed for a position with a state government with a starting salary range of 85-103K, and I made the shortlist for a job this year with the federal government with a starting salary of 110K. Where on the negotiations tab (or readily available national data through Chronicle) does the average academic salary compete with those numbers? 6) Seconding 5. Unless your definition of ""decent places"" is restricted to private R1s and SLACs in expensive locations, federal salaries are almost exactly on par with and often higher than those in academia.",NA,"Interview date I was invited for an in person interview but I am traveling non-stop for the next few weeks. Is it reasonable for me to ask the chair to schedule my in person interview 5 weeks from now? 2) Not really IMO, especially if it is a job you are definitely interested in. 3) IDK, did they offer any date range?  3) If they said it has to be in 2 weeks, ask for 3 or 4.  But it had better be professional travel not a trip to Cancun.   You may get bonus cred if you're away in Antarctica or Papua New Guinea for field work. If you're gone for 5 weeks or more, fly back, cancel plans, or skype.  I don't recommend option 3. 4) I've scheduled interviews about tha far out before. 5) Might as well try!! 6) It's one thing if the department is expecting a visit too quickly (like within in a week) then you are reasonable to ask for more time. But if they are saying 2-4 weeks then you asking for later than that may downgrade your application. They may even decide to ask someone else. You could also consider how unfair it is to the applicants to have more time and delay the decision for them as well. 7) @6 It's really up to the search committee / HR to ensure the process is fair to all applicants; it's not the applicants' responsibility. 8) I have asked for, and received, a 4 week lead time because of already paid-for international fieldwork. That was at a US R2. It would probably not work in UK/Europe where all candidates are interviewed together in a symposium. 9) OP here, I asked. Didn't go very well. Was pressured into accepting to go within one week and I said I couldn't because I'm traveling. They initially accepted my request of scheduling my visit 5 weeks from today but then ended up contacting me again and saying that I needed to visit in the next few weeks. I made some changes to my traveling schedule (which is related to my work, I'm not on vacation or anything like that) and I'll be visiting in a couple of weeks. I feel like this won't look good when they're making the final decision :(   10) When you visit try to make it clear you are still very interested and were willing to rearrange work travel to be there.  Usually they view dragging your feet as a signal you don't care, so your major goal should be to overcome that.   Make sure you're ready with questions about what it's like to live there, if there's faculty housing, and other signals you want to move in.  11) I doubt this will hurt you at all. Pushing to have it earlier was likely due to something internal to the search/university. I can't imagine them holding it against you. 12) As long as you're negotiating this in good faith (and providing enough detail to the person you're negotiating with so that they can see that you're in good faith), I don't think any of these negotiations about the conditions of your interview should affect your interview much.  For instance we had a candidate unavailable in our preferred date range due to medical procedure, which was interviewed last as a result. The fact that organizing the interview was complicated was not a factor later in discussions about candidates. But if the person organizing your visit thinks you are not in good faith (e.g. you're refusing their interview so you can do elective travel) then yes you could be downgraded. 13) OP - Thank you! I was transparent about everything and provided details on to why I wasn't able to travel on their preferred date. I also made major changes to my travelling work schedule (and let them know that I accomodated to visit early) so let's hope for the best 13) if it is professional travel, then tell them your schedule with windows.

NA,MSU MSU Terrestrial Vert Ecologist Position Any news on the vertebrate ecologist position at MSU?  (2) Nope!,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,LIU Weird to think I applied to a job there during the end of my PhD. Good thing I didn't get it? Any one know someone that is locked out right now?  2) Huh? What's LIU? 3) Long Island University - they locked out their unionized faculty ,"Someone was talking about how the placement of spaces in a manuscript made them hate it during review.  REALLY?? SPACES?? That's all you care about in a 50 page manuscript with models, molecular work, and shitloads of stats??  Is this really the kind of asshole who is the gatekeeper for my CV?? 2) You should be honored. Probably means there was little else to comment on but the reviewer felt the need to say something. Also, it was probably a post-doc/PhD student. I've edited for journals over the last few years and it gets harder and harder to find profs that are willing to review papers. PhD students and Post-docs do it fast, do a good job (often times more up-to-date on the subject matter), and mostly appreciate the opportunity.  3) Better to avoid using any spaces in your manuscript so that reviewers can't complain about them. 4) I can assure this postdoc doesn't appreciate the opportunity. I can see a wall of text being hard for some to read. 5) Good for you. It's great not having any intellectual input into your field of research. 6) If you're not getting it from reviewers, talk to your colleagues (I once had a completely intellectually disengaged boss).  7)  Like line spacing or how many spaces you put between sentences?  I personally, prefer to read double-spaced manuscripts.  Single-spaced make my eyes hurt.  Also, I prefer to put two spaces after a sentence, but many only put one.  I would never be so petty as to ding a manuscript on these things though, BUT be sure to follow the manuscript requirements for spacing for that particular journal, as that could be a reason to get a manuscript kicked back.  1) They were absolutely irate b/c some sentences put 2 spaces after a period.  Not line spacing, not journal formatting woes, just literally some sentences had 2 spaces after a period.  I have never seen this mentioned in journal guidelines.  You know why? PAPERS GET TYPESET BY THE FRIGGIN JOURNAL AFTER ACCEPTANCE. 8) Oh come on #5. I 'appreciated the opportunity' to review a few papers as a late grad student and early postdoc. Now that I've reviewed ~80 papers, the 'experience' isn't especially helpful. At that point, postdocs are in a position where they are asked to do a bunch of unpaid work that essentially contributes nothing to chances of landing a permanent job and in fact comes at an opportunity cost of time spent publishing (in fact, since I have kids in daycare, I am actually PAYING to do work that is not part of my job and does not help me get another job). Of course you can just turn reviews down, but the editors sending those out are most likely influential people in the field who may end up on a hiring committee, etc. I know that there are similar problems about unpaid work reviewing for professors, but at least at that point you have a stable job and some % of the salary is supposed to support service to the academic community. As a postdoc with a fellowship or grant funding a specific research project there is no such 'service' component. I'm sure that postdocs and grad-students often do a great job reviewing papers (I know I take it seriously when I review a paper), but ignoring the realities of whta that request means by saying that they 'appreciate the opportunity' is such BS. 9) You are an academician. It is you responsibility to review manuscripts in your field. If you want to get paid for every little thing you do, become a lawyer. To incentivize the review process would turn it into a business, and the credibility of the review process would be destroyed. 8) LOL. Way to miss the point entirely #9. I actually enjoy doing reviews and agree with your statement in regards to professors. What I don't enjoy is having a short term job with no possibility of continuation beyond a couple of years that doesn't pay enough to have my kids in daycare and then being told that I should do some 'free' work that will not help me secure a long term job. And not only that, I should 'appreciate' the fact that I'm getting to do this free work! Oh and I can choose to do it or not, but influential people will know if I choose not to do it and will (potentially) judge me for it. BTW, OP: sorry to hijack this post. I agree that the spaces comment is super annoying and irrelevant! 10) @8, 80 reviews sounds like too many.  As an AE at a top-tier EE journal, I say don't be afraid to say no to reviews.  No one knows your overall service load but you, and editors will not fault you for a prompt ""no"".  Suggesting alternative reviewers is truly appreciated.  (Editors will fault you for going AWOL after you say ""yes"", so avoid that).  If each paper has 2-3 authors and 2-3 reviewers, then I think a fair reviewing stoichiometry for pre-faculty is 1:1 review:paper submitted.  Save your reviewing service for those papers where you are uniquely qualified. 11) @8, I edit for two mid-tier journals and one upper-tier. Trust me, after I invite you to review a manuscript, I don't think about you ever again, unless you accept the review and then I think about you when you submit the review. You're making the world out to be too petty. 12) I've met people I've reviewed for at conferences after they saw my talk, and they had no clue who I was, so I doubt my review had any influence on their opinion of me. I review much more often than I submit, so the whole ""it's your responsibility to do stuff for free"" thing... just no. Re: the OP, some people are OCD about inconsistencies. Search and replace and ignore their comments. One of my reviewers once owned up to not really having read the manuscript because he allegedly didn't understand it. 13) appreciate the input from editors here - thanks. 14) As an editor, trust me, I don't even consider stupid comments about spaces. Sure, they are going to be in the review b/c you will receive the review unedited, but I'm definitely not going to go looking to see if you fixed minor stuff like that. Now, if you get a ""major revision"", there's a chance that the same reviewer (if he/she provided valuable input on top of the formating garbage) might see that manuscript again, so it's up to you if you want to get the same comments from the reviewer back again. 15) A paper I wrote was published with a journal that allows post-publication comments. Someone criticized my lack of serial/Oxford commas.  16) I hope that was one of your friends just messing with you.","Formatting when there are lots of comments x2 For posts where there are a large number of comments, such as the U Washington job, the most important information (institution, subject area, closing date) becomes unreadable because the lines are presently formatted to have the text in the middle or bottom. I need to scroll down carefully, without jumping to the next line, in order to read these vital pieces of info. Could the admin please set the formatting so that this info is shown at the top of their respective boxes, if google allows this? Many thanks for this page, it's a fantastic resource. AP) Great idea, I set Align Top for Columns A-H. 3) Awesome! Thanks friends for this great idea. Much better! 4) #1 here - thanks, admin! ",NA,"Job Resources As seen in one of the postings, not all of the jobs that people apply for end up here. For various reasons (e.g., not sure of the job's fit if it is general biology, scared of the ""not eco-evo"" person that lurks under the bridge between ecology and evolution) some folks don't post every job here that they apply for. Instead of harping on those folks to ""post everything"" (which I gather isn't what everyone really wants), can we list some of the potential places you all look for jobs and what you find there or other commentary you might have on that particular venue? Also mention if it is already linked in the ""links"" section. 2) I'm one of the people that adds a lot of jobs to this site....I don't go through the trouble of posting everything and I don't expect that---but I do post everything that I am considering applying for because a) putting it in heree helps my own formatting sheet and b) I want to know whats happening in the search. In any case---it's not realistic to have everyone put everything in this sheet...but I feel like it is courteous to put things in here if you are considering to apply for it because neglecting to is akin to hiding information and also, your reaping benefits but not contributing. Just me. 3) Sure OP (apologies for the long response): Chronicle of higher ed, times higher ed, higher ed jobs, science jobs, Rob Jackson's website, and ecolog are the big ones. The others are societies like soil science society of america, society of american foresters, the LTER list serve, experimental network list serves like smart forest, nutrient network, and texas a and m university job board. Others are: higher ed recruitment consortium, academiccareers.com, academic jobs online, versatile phd, and unijobs. Finally, there are still jobs that are never posted to these, particularly at smaller schools. For those, you have to actually go to school's job website. I usually find about 4-5 of these a year that are never posted on any of the above places. In total, about 80 % of the jobs in my fields of interest that I find, that have the word ecology in the ad, end up here. However, there are countless environmental science/studies jobs that never mention the word ecology that aren't posted here - ones that most ecologists are easily qualified for. Additionally, there are many general, broadly-worded biology positions that are not posted here - ones that are ambiguous as to whether the department is looking for an ecologist or a neuroscientist (I once posted one of these here and got yelled at by 'not eco evo' person). These are often overlooked, but I had an interview at a place with one of these broadly-worded ads. This year, 73 % of the jobs I am applying to ended up here. Finally, this board is completely skewed toward R1 and research-heavy jobs. All of those end up here, while the smaller schools that are more teaching focused are much less likely to be here. When they are, commenters often complain about their teaching load. Most people here seem to be focused on, and dreaming about, getting an R1 job. So, if you are only trying for an R1 or elite SLAC, this board can be your one-stop shop. Otherwise, you may have to mine a little more to find those gems :). As for the commentary signaling the virtues of posting jobs here - I think it is quite obvious on its face why all jobs aren't posted here (I am thinking of Two Lectures on the Checks to Population by William Forster Lloyd, 1833), and I find it hard to fault people for such classicly-studied, basic human behavior. Anyway, I hope that helps - Good luck! 4) jobs.ac.uk may be a good source of jobs if you are considering UK jobs. 5) For the jobs at SLACs, often there are regional associations of colleges (like ACM or Great Lakes Colleges Association) that have job clearinghouses or at least a list of links to faculty employment pages for each indivdiual college. There are also sometimes relationships between these associations and the big D1 conferences... for instance, there is a Big Ten/ACM Academic Alliance that includes a faculty fellows pipeline to help increase diversity at ACM schools 6) I would like to nominate #3 for the best answer on the wiki this year. Bravo. X6",NA,"Got a number of papers in respectable journals, profs say materials are great. Yet no interviews. Even phone interview requests are nearly non-existent. What am I missing? I've applied broadly for multiple years. 2) Lots of people are experiencing the same situation, it's just a shitty experience. I don't think there is much you can do other than to keep publishing and to show your materials to more people (I have improved my materials each time I have had a different person looking at them). After many years trying and hundreds of applications, persistance and patience and possibly a bit of misguided optimism are the only things keeping me in the game (well, also the fact that my particular experience does not offer me any real plan B). 3) I'm in the same situation and everyone that I talk with about it or show my materials says some variant on ""I can't believe you don't have a job""/""These look great, you'll get a job for sure if you keep trying"", etc. I realize that the intent is good, but I'm really tired of hearing that response from people who got permanent jobs without any major struggle. x3 4) Same situation. Demoralizing. 5) There has to be something relatively quantifiable that the hiring committees use to select people besides the mysterious ""fit"" though, right? Especially since they have to sift through hundreds to over a thousand applications. 6) No, in the end, there's nothing quantifiable. It's impossible to pick the best candidate out of 100 applicants. If you gave 100 applications to 10 different people, I doubt the same top candidate would be picked by anyone. It's a complete crapshoot. 7) I diagree. If you ask 10 different people to identify the top 6 candidates, there would often be overlap. Not complete agreement. Not the same top pick. But not a random crapshoot. 8) Agree with 7 - not random at all.  In my department, reviewers from different backgrounds (pop ecol, evo-devo, etc.) will identify similar subsets of top candidates.  A lot comes down to cover letter and statement writing.  The CV is important, but at least a third of the pool is competitive based soley on CV.  It is how you write about your experience and convinece the committee that you will be a great colleague and contributor to the department/division/whatever.  Of course, lots of candidates write great statements, but great CV + great statements stands out. 9) Also agree that it's not a total crapshoot. In the last several hiring bouts in my department, at least 1/2 of candidates invited for interviews and given offers ended up with competing offers from R1s... that means even across departments and institutions there is some consistency in identifying the top candidates. Don't know whether that is less demoralizing, though! 10) So to summarize: maybe not a total crapshoot, there are applications everyone thinks is awesome, and one needs a great CV and statements - but we are still no closer to identifying anything remotely quantifiable about the process :( 11) No, nothing quantifiable, at least not when teasing out the top quartile of candidates.  More like assessing movies or literature, I suppose - lots of dimensions of quality to consider, and although individual opinions vary, there is often general consensus as to what is good versus excellent versus outstanding. 12) @8, i think we all know what makes a great CV, more or less, but what would you say differentiates great staements from just good or mediocre ones? 13) #7 here. I'd say in general the teaching statement doesn't have a big impact on me other than some are terrible and few seem to give very clear ideas and communicate a commitment to being a good teacher. Diversity statement is similar that it mostly can be a place where a statement shows a lack of effort (in my opinion), but better ones can move an application up. For the research statement I don't think I can say anything new other than it should be written at a level that all (or most) biologists can understand (so clear organized writing without acronyms and inside lingo), should communicate a theme to your research and interests (a vision), and should have a mix of past and future research (similar to the vision). Frankly, when I am looking for a new colleague I am most excited when the person shows they are a clear and creative thinker. 14) I feel you, OP. I'm kind of in the same boat. I've had numerous faculty who have been on search committees recently go over my written stuff and say I've got really great chances, but then bupkiss! Part of me worries its other things, like I have fellowships, lots of first author pubs etc, but I can't do anything about where I went for undergrad/PhD, nor who I worked with. I am crossing my fingers that I'm being dinged for such things, but I can't help but feel hurt when I see most people who annouce they accepted a position be from the same couple of places. 15) @14, if it makes you feel better, some of us who've done PhD and postdoc at top institutions (and have all th eother qualifications) are also striking out. x3 16) Thanks for the thoughts @7! 16) I agree - I have been on a number of committees and candidates CVs look great, but the cover letter and associated statements can sink you - especially if they don't actually address the job ad.  I think you want to make sure you tailor your statements more specifically to the position and the program - i.e., look up researchers and put in your cover letter and research statement how specifically your work would complement research going on, don't just list what you do.  Ditto for teaching, talk about your teaching and list some actual classes from their course catalog you would actually be able to teach.  AND make sure you have good letter writers! That can also affect whether you get a phone interview. 17) Some of this is literally the opposite of what was suggested in the ""awkward cover letter"" thread. If you expect tailoring, mention it in the ad and don't leave people guessing!"
NA,West Virginia University To the computational evolutionary biology interviewee: just curious to know if they were looking more for a computational person or a bench person ,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Number of applications sent in Food for thought - how do you approach the number of applications sent in on the faculty job page? Sure, people get to these jobs from other sites (Highered, ChronicleVitae, etc.,), but what would you guess is the average number of applications jobs are getting? How do you think this varies from the tiny SLAC schools to the R1s?  2) Multiple the number of people who said they applied for a particular job on this website by 20 and you'll probably get the total number of applicants. For example, I wouldn't be surprised if the UT Austin job got around 380 applications.3) Yeah, I just applied for a job with only three applications turned in listed on this site and I'm all....what should I multiply that by 4) I learned from last year not to take too much from the estimates provided here - there seemed to be very little correlation, except maybe the postings with the most applicants listed here tend to get a lot of applicants. I had multiple positions last year that only had 2 or 3 applicants listed on here, but was told in rejection letters that >100 applied. 5) <- agreed. Your guess about the number of applicants, based on your knowledge of the school and the field of study, is probably much more accurate than any metric derived from the numbers of applicants reported here. 6) our decent, desirable R1 had ~150 apps last year for an ecologist position. 7) Our rural R1 has had ~20-40 apps for some positions.

However, it is quite annoying to go back and check better some comments and find them deleted. For example, the faculty job in evolution at the University of Nevada showed interesting comments, now all deleted. UWashington job seems to be updated almost every day, but from a some point comments have been immediately deleted. There was an interesting discussion about permanent residency on this sheet, now deleted. Can you please respect and leave other people's comments? x3 2) Fixed the Reno cell from version history ",NA,"Interview process in Canada vs US I have been invited to my first on-campus interview in Canada. I am familiar with the interview process in the US. Should I expect things to be very similar in Canada? Or are there substantial differences? 2) Everything will be in French and in lieu of a research talk you are judged on your poutine x2 3) similar to US x2 4) lol @2 x2  5)  The interveiw will be similar to the US, but there are some general differences in other things. For example, many more students do MSc degrees first before PhDs in Canada (not the case if your interview is UBC or UofT, but everywhere else), and this often translates into many more graduate students per lab. e.g. I interviewed at a Canadian R1 equivalent, and was asked about what size my ideal lab would be, and I said ~4 graduate students. They then said that the average lab in their department had ~8 students (mostly MSc). Another big difference is obviously funding. Make sure you have a general sense of how NSERC works (ie. you apply once every 5 years, have a reasonably good chance of success, but will get substantially less $$ than a typical NSF grant). 6) I've found the interview process a little less 'intense' in Canada vs USA. One example: I arranged my own rides to and from events via a cab and had more downtime. Also the interviews were a bit shorter. This might not be typical, but meant I was 'on' a bit less. More importantly: typically the committee wants to ask the same questions of the candidates, so they generally have a roundtable with previously determined questions (like a script). I saw this setup at 2/2 Canadian interviews, 0/3 US interviews. It means things are a bit more equitable in the treatment of candidates, but can seem intense and less comfortable for some people. Maybe ask if you will have a similar meeting with the entire committee? 7) OP here: thanks for the information, it's really useful. 8) Yes, agreed, with #6 about the scripted questions from the entire commitee -- 3/3 Cdn interviews had this, 0/2 US. Also, some of the Cdn search committees had a grad student representative on them. Also, because faculty are unionized at Cdn schools (all or just some, IDK?), some aspects of negotiation are moot. 9) No Canadian experience, but I've had scripted committee interviews like 6 & 8 at 2/3 US universities. 10) Same. US phone interviews have been almost universally scripted (they say as much during the interview), but I've had 3 scripted on-campus interviews as well  11) In Canada for the chalk talk they wanted more big picture, change the world talk.  Not details of your first 2 projects and if they are tractable, which is more common in the US.  Some of that is related to how funding works. 12) @4) Whoever made the ""lol"" comment or agreed with it: why are you so offended by the existence of other people whose own anecdotal experiences differ from your own? 13) the ""lol"" comment was in reference to post 2, which is clearly a joke. lighten up.",NA,"Talk of funding sources - Cover letter, research statement, both? How much detail?? EVERYWHERE YOU CAN LIST IT.  x2 2) Yeah this is a biggie. If you're bringing in external funding they really want to know. If the funding is considerable you're almost guaranteed a second look given you don't blow the rest of the app. (source -- conversations with people on hiring committees at my current institution) 3) OP here, I meant it more as of potential funding sources. I've had faculty members say I need to have something written about what grants I'll apply for once I got the job, which I currently have in my cover letter, but was wondering how much I should reiterate it in the research statement. Don't want to put in too much it makes me look ridiculous like I don't know what I'm talking about, but not too little to make it look like I'm unaware of how important that is.  1) Aha.  Then put in your research statment an explanation of how it fits with human health and go to NIH or Rules of Life at NSF.   Mention in your cover letter you would submit for funding to NIH and NSF (or equivalent for your field) but only 1 sentence.  2) again -- yeah don't harp on it. Better to spend space in your application on things you can prove you do well, whether that's publications, mentoring, funding, whatever. Future funding applications will play a bigger role once you get to interview stage. Should you be invited for an interview, you should be ready to outline your first grant apps in a chalk talk format. "

Or are you...chicken? 2) 🐔 3) I cry fowl - they are only plucking from the (chicken) coop. 4) There are conflicting statements about whether a person not already in a federal position can apply for this. How does this work? 5) As someone in the coop system, I've never heard of them not hiring a federal employee or former fed (though I'm sure they'd be happy to hire a vet or other person under the noncompetative status). I'm unclear as to why it's indicated otherwise on the posting here. 4) thanks for the insight. on the official job announcement, it states clearly under ""who may apply"" that you must be a current/former fed or eligible status candidate (e.g., veteran). if you're a plain US citizen, you do not qualify for the job - the job ad itself doesn't even appear if you search for it and click ""who may apply - US citizens"". i've never heard of the coop operating that way, which is why i found it odd to see that position advertised that way. 5) update - all interviewing candidates current federal employees","Let's start the new season off bitter, after realizing that where you've interviewed, it ended up being somewhat of a farce. Favorite candidates were already waiting in the wings, string were being pulled. Even though you and the other candidates did their very best, you had very little, if any chance. OK. I'm done. Back to optimism.  2) Hey friend, that really sucks and I am sorry that you had to go through that. However, you are a rockstar! So keep going and know that they missed out by not hiring you, and you probably wouldnt want to work with a bunch of toolbags anyway. 3). Exactly. 4) @ #2, this is the venting page. Positive affirmation is next door :). 5) That was the case for the evolutionary medicine position last year at ASU. They had a favorite candidate but wasted everyone else's time.  6) Not the faculty's fault that they are ""wasting time"". HR and union rules usually require that TT jobs go out for a search.","diversity statements 1) per the venting tab, there is interest/confusion about what a ""statement of contributions to diversity"" is, as is now required by the UC campuses. A couple tips: the SC is not allowed to consider personal attributes (whether you're POC, gay, military vet, female, etc).  The statement is about what you have done to foster diversity, not what you are.  It's possible for a white male to have a great diversity statement. But often, personal attributes may play a role in what a candidate has done to foster diversity, and it is fine to mention these in the statement, but the search committee is instructed to ignore this component.  Is this confusing?  Heck yes.  2) Thanks, #1! This is helpful. (x2) 3) I heard from a friend who was on several searches at a UC that she saw many different approaches to the diversity statement (although all addressing #1's point), and that there was no one ""right"" way to do the statement. It is about what diversity means to you and what you do to help foster that.  4) Even if you don't have to write that doc, be prepared with some answers for your interviews.  People will ask.  It doesn't take much outreach to be able to say you want to help launch scientists of tomorrow.  5) #1's comments are very good. My two cents here: the diversity statment (full name: statement of contributions to diversity) is about how you contribute to diversity in the past and in the future, not about who you are. Being POC, gay, female, et. al is and should only be a small part of the statment.  1) here again, @#3 I agree there's no one ""right"" way to do it, but boy there sure are a lot of wrong ways to do it!  Especially, when in the committee interview, the committee asks candidate about diversity, have a ready answer that is similar to what the diversity statment said. Don't get caught flat-footed and divert the conversation onto a topic having little to do with diversity, as happened to a couple candidates in our previous search. 6) @1 they're ""not supposed to consider what you are""....but they do. Moral of the story, if you're a ""low diversity candidate"", write a good diversity statement, and hopefully you mean it.",NA,"who got the job? How do you figure out who got a given job after the whole process ends? Is it ok to ask here? Some universities are huge and have complicated departmental structures so it can be kind of difficult to figure out just by checking their websites. 2) I usually find out via obnoxious ""I'm thrilled to announce..."" posts on Twitter 3) Jeremy Fox from Dynamic Ecology here. Re: ""it can be kind of difficult to figure out just by checking [department] websites"", welcome to my world. :-) https://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/ecology-faculty-job-market-data/ 4) What do y'all think about posting the publically announced results here? AP 5) If public, seems fair. 6) Announcing names here seems like an invitation for people to make negative comments about their competitors. I don't know... 7) I like the idea with the stipulation that there is no commentary about the quality of the hires (as 6 says that could get ugly). Especially for this year and going forward I think it would be nice since Jeremy Fox's data has covered the last few years but I believe he is not planning to compile similar data for this year. 8) Depending on how the ""horrible men list"" lawsuit plays out, the owner of this sheet could be open to legal action if names are put here. 9) Like everything else attempted to be tracked on this board, the data would be shitty and incomplete. 10) I think it's perfectly fine for departments and new hires to say ""I'm thrilled to announce"" so long as they aren't explicitly rubbing their hiring in other candidate's faces. It's great that people are proud of joining new institutions and that institutions are proud of their new hires. 11) To #8: How could the AP be liable to legal action for posting the names of hired professors? It's not protected information if someone outs their new job on social media or if a name is posted on a university webpage. It's just aggregating already public information. Maybe a compromise is a view-only list to prevent haters from commenting. 12) https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/12/17965864/shitty-media-men-list-lawsuit-stephen-elliott-moira-donegan. 13) Jeremy Fox from Dynamic Ecology here. I can tell you from my experience that haphazard data on who was hired, compiled primarily from social media, is likely to be both a much smaller sample than mine, and a statistically-biased sample. For instance, new hires I learned about via social media were more likely to be women than were all new hires. So haphazardly-compiled data isn’t going to be a good guide to systemic trends in the ecology faculty job market. Also, even systematically compiling names of new hires, without any other information, isn’t going to give job seekers any useful systemic information about the ecology faculty job market as a whole. Unless I’m missing something, the main purpose of compiling names of new hires, without any other information, would be to make it easier for disappointed job seekers to satisfy their curiosity about who ended up getting hired. I leave it to others to decide if merely compiling names of new hires (haphazardly or otherwise) is worth doing; I personally don’t think it is but YMMV. Regarding the other topics that have come up in this thread, I don’t see any legal or ethical issues with compiling and publishing public information. And speaking purely personally, I agree with the suggestion not to allow any comments about anybody who was hired. 14) Maybe I'm missing something, but I feel like a list of recent hires would also be hugely valuable for people who are considering postdoc options.  Recent hires will typically have start up funds, and many of them may be more interested than established professors in taking on a postdoc, as postdocs typically generate data and papers after a shorter ramp-up period than graduate students do. 15) If so, that data already exist on blog guy's blog - in its most complete form. Why replicate it here in terrible fashion? 16) @15, it exists for 2015-17 job cycles but he is not doing it again for this year or going forward. 17) To Jeremy - hoping you re-do your analysis of who gets jobs/interviews again this year. I think the trends are getting a little severe.",NA,"Do search committees look at self-identification info on applications? Does it matter? The standard self identification info that all jobs have you fill out can't be seen by search committees. Or at least it isn't supposed to be able to be seen. 2) YES 3) I belong to an underrepresented group in STEM and I feel very uncomfortable checking boxes because I don't want my background to influence wether I get selected or not. Everyone thinks it provides some sort of advantage because supposedly there's this huge push to increase diversity in departments, but I am convinceded it doesn't help at all, in fact, I think it makes it worse  3) New SC member here working with one of the commen job app systems.  I can see veterans status, visa status, and relationships with someone already employed at our uni. I cannot see gender, sex, race, ethnicity, or disability status. I assume all of those stay with HR.  If a commonly represented class is not on our interview list, HR may review why.  At some schools they may see value in recruiting URMs for diverity and representation.  At others I imagine they will work agains you.  I'm hoping more schools are leaning toward the former, especially as people actively work for change.  4) I've been on many SC's and we *never* get gender/racial info from HR.  That info is for AA compliance but through HR, not the SC.  Check out <https://chroniclevitae.com/news/302-should-you-check-the-race-box>. 5) I'm on a SC right now and we don't get that info. But I do look for any mention of race, gender, etc. in the application materials. We're looking to increase the diversity of our department, so any candidate that mentions being a minortiy, etc. definitely gets a bump up in our first round of scoring. 6) SC member here, too. Only HR gets that info here, but when we submit lists for phone interviews and on-campus interviews the proportion of demographic groups should at least align with national proportions in the field or we go back to our pool (HR gives thumbs up or down to lists, does not release candidate info). That may not be true everywhere, though.  6) Faculty member here.  I have been on a search committee on which this information was accidentally placed in the file they gave us.  If you really want to ensure that your demographic info is not available to the search committee, choose not to answer.  7) I'm at a UC. Our HR uses that info (anonomyzed) to assess whether we're interviewing a 'representative' sample from among the applicant pool (and they assess applicant pool from among multiple searches).  So if URM or F does not self-identify, HR thinks the pool is whiter and more male than it really is.  When we run a search in a particular subdiscipline (e.g. related to engineering) and the pool of self-reporters is 80% male, then when 4/5 shortlisted candidates are male, the dean doesn't question our shortlist.  By contrast, if self-reporters are 50/50 M/F, and we submitted  a shortlist that was 100% M, we would definitely get pushback from the dean.  So, bottom line is, if you chose to NOT self-identify, you are making HR think that the applicant pool is less diverse than it really is. SC is strictly instructed to not pay attention to any protected status info an applicant might divulge, since Affirmative Action is illegal in California. 8) thanks for the info @7! that's really good to know.

NA,"Northern Kentucky University- Animal Behavior Offer Who accepted an offer? I haven't even received a rejection... (1) Not me. But often rejections aren't sent out until the offer is formally accepted and a contract is signed. That is, if rejections are sent out at all... (2) I did. I posted right away because I have been on the other side of things many times and I appreciated knowing as soon as possible if I was out of the running for a position. Best of luck to everyone! (3) Congratulations!!! Who are you? (4) I'm not the person who received this offer, but I think it is inappropriate to ask who they are - some semblance of anonymity here would be nice. (5) nah! if you want to say who you are, or if someone knows, post it. (6) I agree with #5, no harm done in posting who gets what. It helps those who are left without even a courteous rejection notification figure out what the SC was looking for. If you don't want to post your name after accepting an offer, then don't. (7) If you've accepted the offer, your name will be on their website in the near future anyway, so why would you be trying to retain anonymity? (8) Anonymity is at least one reason why people use this site.  Posting names achieves absolutely nothing.  Its been said a number of times here, but I'll say it again.  If you are not choosen, why do you care who was?  Comparing yourself to others may be fun, but it is completely pointless and unhelpful in the overall job search.  (By the way, it is one thing to disagree with the comments here, it is another to change someone else's comments.  Sad.) (9)  7 here - I don't know if I agree with you on your first point (I absolutely agree with your point about deleting other people's comments, unless they're antagonistic or abusive). (10) I think as far as posting names, aside from trying to keep things private etc, there is the real potential for names to be posted based on rumor or by friends or friends of friends. That could really backfire.  Sure, once someone has signed the contract etc it would be harmless, but given the particularities of each position and person, I think it best to just keep it anonymous.  If you really care who was hired, you can look at the website.  It would be awful to have someone post a name of a person who was offered a position etc when that person is still trying to make a decision or interviewing elsewhere.  Given the level of curiosity (in my opinion, an unhealthy level of curiosity) here about who is hired for what, how we compare to each other, who went to an ivy league school, etc, I think it is a legitimate fear to think that someone would overhear something and take it too far and screw it up for someone else.  Let's just avoid the potential for disaster. (11) #10 you bring up some good points and I hope we can all be considerate of everyone's privacy.  That said, if and when I get my offer (and everything is finalized), I will be the first to post my name on here. In fact, I just thought of this, if and when I do get my first offer, not only will post on here who I am, but will also advertise my post doc (assuming I get a line in my startup). So, I'm going to start a post-doc advert sheet on here. This has been a super tense job search season and most of us will be looking for jobs next year and the year after. And a few of us will have jobs and possibly post doc lines. So, if you're a new hire and are looking for dedicated postdocs, advertise here and give one of your job seeking pals a break.

(x4)","Conference talks/posters in CV Hope everyone had a great and relaxing Thanksgiving! I am wondering whether people include their contributed talk/poster at conferences in their CV. I think this is good to show that I gave multiple talks at conferences, and my recent presentations show what I have been working on (but far from being published). The down side is this could make the CV rather long (I try to fit everything in 5 page). Or should I only include invited seminars? Thank you for your input! 2) If it's at a meeting that I go to most years, I'll just list that I gave talks at, say, ESA 2013, 2015, 2017 instead of breaking it down into three lines. No titles are needed. 3) I list invited talks only, and no longer list posters (but I think this is dependent on career stage/etc). Invited talks for me include conferences where they choose speakers from abstracts. 4) Invited talks are different from those where they choose speakers from abstracts. 5) I agree with 4 - being selected as a speaker from submitted abstracts at conferences is definitely not an invited talk. Also, just my two cents, unless there is a stated page limit for your CV, I would not omit something from it that is directly pertinent to my qualifications for a position just because of space issues. But I would not fret one way or the other OP. Conference presentations will likely not weigh heavy w/ SC, but, as you noted, it might be nice to point demostratively to those couple lines on your CV. So I don't think including posters would hurt you, but there's a chance it could be helpful. 6) The SC might ask about your attendance at meetings. Having posters etc. listed can help with that, and establish which meetings you usually go to. 7) With respect to invited talks, I have given several that have the same title. Was the talk always exactly the same? No but they were on the same topic and I thought the title was catchy. However, it looks kind of weird on the CV to have the same talk listed several times (with different dates and locations, of course)...or does it not really matter? 8) I don't put the titles on my CV, just the month, year and location. x2",NA,"National Service Employers Here's a thing that's new to me that might be useful to others.

Search committees in some systems can still see your app and may not have met yet.   But be prepared for it not to get through. 3) 5-time SC member here - my colleagues are typically not forgiving of late applications and argue that we ignore anything that comes in after the deadline.  This is not an irrational mindset, given that we have hundreds of applications to go through, but I always check up to a week after the deadline just to make sure we have not missed a gem.  Bottom line - your application may or may not be read, and even if it is, it may not get the same thorough evaluation given to pre-deadline applications. 4) Posted something similar to this previously...my Human Resources department won't send us late applications. We wouldn't know your application exists. But no harm in trying. I'm sure there's a lot of variability in the process between universities. 5) F it, what do you have to lose? 6) Time. 7) I have twice seen jobs that looked ideal for me about a month after the deadline and both times I wrote to the contact address to ask if it's still worth applying. The first time they said no, but the second time they said yes, I applied immediately, and I was asked to interview shortly after I submitted my app!

I'm in the states now and generally enjoy it, though the way funding works here is daunting. I'm hoping that fewer Canadian positions this year might mean more next year? 3) I intended to go back to Canada, but there were so few positions that I ended up staying in the US; many parts of it are downright enjoyable/sane if you can ignore the ridiculous national politics X2 4) OP here. I should mention that I postdocked in the US so I know that life is pretty good if you stay in your bubble but that's precisely the conundrum that makes the thought of going to the US so infuriating, that I will likely contribute to the problem.

Lethbridge's two members of the provincial legislature at the moment are both from the NDP, the most politically-left party in the legislature. They're roughly the Canadian equivalent of labor union Democrats in the US.

I'm specifically looking at the environmental microbiology position at Cornell (https://academicjobsonline.org/ajo/jobs/11957). It seems like a really high load of teaching for a research intensive institution, no? Any thoughts? 2) Those percentages don't really mean much. I've been on phone interviews where the SCs have ranged from 50% to 75% for the same university, and then they actually argued about the percentage. Percentage of time toward teaching is really a time management issue that you will have to figure out. I know people at R1s that can't do anything else when they have to teach one course in a semester because it is so time intensive. I also know people that teach 4 courses a semester and are super productive. 3) I agree with #2. 50% teaching load is not much, althought it seems a bit high for an R1. Still, at 50% you can have a very productive lab at an R1 institution if you manage your time well. 4) 3 to 4, 3-credit hour courses per year would be ~50% at my (R1) institution.

I've seen a few where the lab hours get multiplied by 0.5 to determine contact hours or even just one contact hour for the lab. 1) so you're saying that they may say that it's 12 contact hours, but in reality you'll be in class/lab with students for 18+ hours 2) It could - some treat credit hours for labs the same way as lecture, but the ones that do it that way are probably in the minority (in my limited experience).  3) Some jobs gave 1.5-2x credit for labs, which are 1hr.

I kind of had to ""fight"" my postdoc PI about it, but eventually he came over to my side on things and other PIs have expressed how good of an idea it was. So I say go for it! 6) You fought your postdoc advisor for permission to write a cover letter? 7) I was in this position last year. I applied to a few place (ones that were particularly good fits). I found it super helpful. I got a few phone interviews and a campus interview, so it was great experience for this year's application season. 8) #5 here, no, I wasn't fighting him on him letting me write a cover letter. Just he didn't think applying was a good idea since he felt it might have been too soon, so I had to convince him that writing ALL those documents (research statement, diversity statement, teaching statement, cover letter) was worth doing just to get ahead for the future. 9) Many recent hires at my institution were made when the candidate was in theird 1st year of a postdoc.  Several of them actually negotiated a later start so that they could get another year of experience. 10) If you might be even vaguely competitive, apply- either you'll hone your materials, or you'll get interview practice, or a job! All wins. I got interveiws my first year out. I persoanlly know three people hired to R1s in ecology before they deferended their PhDs... 11) Agree, if you have a track record of funding and pubs even with a limited postdoc experience, you could be competitive - let's say you were an NSF GRFP fellow, and then were an NSF postdoc for that year, that is a clear demonstration of fundability.  I am at an R2 and we have hired multiple people who just started their postdocs (<6months in) because of their productivity.  12) You never know what a search committee is going to do.  If you have publications and evidence of securing funds, apply.  I am at an R1, was hired in first year of my post doc."

But, just a rumor, so who knows?(4) Given that this is a ""re-search"" from last years, this is not surprising at all.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Who got offers last year? ,NA,"Updating SC 1) What do people think about updating the SC?  When I applied for a job, I had a paper listed on my CV as ""in review"" that is now ""in press.""  It's definitely my highest impact paper, and I was considering emailing the search chair with the update.  I know I'm still in the running as my letter writers were just contacted.  Or is it annoying to send updates?  2) Don't send updates. x4 3) You can mention it during an interview if you get one, but dont send an update. They aren't going to be hiring you or not based on one manuscript. 4) Updating (successful) grant status is a different story - that I *would* tell the SC about. 5) if its science/nature/PNAS, or a major grant (=NSF or bigger) then update.  Otherwise, don't bother. These types of messages are fairly common to the SC and will probably not annoy (or at least, shouldn't) as long as you keep it short and don't update twice. But most of them will be completely ignored.  6) I agree with #4 and #5 - do update if it's actually major. And if it's your highest impact paper, it might well be worth it. I don't think anybody is going to be annoyed by a pleasant email saying that you've had more professional success since you applied that might be of interest to them. 7) I'd recommend updating, esp for higher impact papers and grants. I updated while on the market and was told afterwards (by committee members from 2 separate searches) that they appreciated the update - one job I actually got!",NA,"Working abroad I am applying broadly/globally, but I am most familiar with academic systems/funding in North America (undergrad/postdoc in US, PhD in Canada). Can anyone recommend resources for understanding the differences with how other systems work, like the UK, Europe, Australia, etc.? Thanks for your help! 2) Europe doesn't have a uniform system... 3) I'm American and did my PhD in the US but I've been living/working in Germany for 5 years and have never looked back. There is a lot of research money here (comparatively). If you want to make the move over then it is often easiest to apply for a grant, and THEN get a job after. The German Research Foundation (DFG, Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft) has lots of funding options that you can apply to as a PI even as a postdoc (http://www.dfg.de/en/research_funding/programmes/individual/index.html). There are also funds at the EU level with the European Research Council. These grants are generally much bigger and more prestigous (and yet still have a fund rate of over 10%!).You just need to get an institute/uni to agree to host you, which is generally not difficult. I mean, the DFG has a fund rate of over 30% for first time applicants, you get 30 days paid vacation a year (that they expect you to use), parental leave is a real thing here (12 months!) and you can drink in the streets. 4) I have experience in North America and Europe. Europe is great for general life (especially work/life balance) and funding rates are better that the US (at least in the wealthier countries and at the EU level). But getting a permanent job in Europe takes longer - remember that the Ph.D. takes half as long there and so it's generally expected that one does multiple postdocs before getting a job. Landing a position is also harder, requires more networking (many jobs are not broadly advertised), and they frequently come with little to no resources. The last is not as bad as it sounds, as many departments share technicians among several labs, which is efficient (and also means that technicians have better job security and can invest in advanced training). Also, on average even the big universities have much smaller departments, so you tend to have fewer ecologist colleagues.  1 again) Thanks for the info, keep it coming! Also happy to get book/blog recommendations. @2 yeah, I realize that all of Europe doesn't have the same system, however figured no one wanted to read a full list of countries when I could just refer to the region, and also some things, like EU-wide funding structures, might be similar across several countries. @3 See, that sounds amazing.  5) Actually, in some European countries like Sweden the short PhD thing doesn't really apply. 6) @5 I don't have experience in Sweden but the first link on google mentions a 4-year minimum (https://studyinsweden.se/plan-your-studies/degree-programmes/phd-studies/). Perhaps it tends to extend longer. But I'd put that in between the standard Europe duration and the US duration. 5) again. I used to work there. ~5 is typical with extensions for teaching, parental leave, etc.  3 again) It is true that permanent jobs are harder to come by, but at least in Germany, you have a major advantage where you can essentially create your own (medium-term) job: for grant proposals to the German Science Foundation you are completely allowed to request your own salary (along with research money, student money etc) AND unlike the US, you can be a PI on these grants without having a permanent job - you just need an institute to agree to host you for the duration. This is what I am funded on now and am getting ready to submit another one (and with a fund rate of over 25% I feel pretty good about it). It's sort of a great avenue to become a ""Super-postdoc"" and establish independence and you can still keep an eye out for permanent posts. Obviously if you need major infrastructure for your research this could be a problem, but for a lot of us this would work! 7) As someone who did their PhD in north america and post-docing in Sweden, I can say that what was said about Germany regarding funding and conditions generally applies to Sweden as well.  One thing worth noting, that has not been said, is that in the Nordic countries (and perhaps some others like Germany) although PhDs are about as long as they are in north america, the stipends for PhD students are much much higher (here in Sweden, PhD students make what would be considered a postdoc salary anywhere else; postdocs end up being cheaper than phd students, in fact, which is crazy). This means PhD students cost a fortune, and you need a huge grant to take them on. Although paying grad students a high wage is certainly a great thing, the reality is that it can become very difficult to take on students without a huge ERC grant or similar 8) Germany has a 7 year rule, which means you need a permanent position (paid by a university, not a grant) 7 years post-PhD. After 7years, grants will no longer fund you (it's actually a law). You either get 1) permanent position, 2) leave academia or 3) the country. Most pick #2 or #3 since #1 rarely happens. OP) Wondering about this again. Anyone have tips on the differences between job apps between Sweden and North America? Thanks in advance!",NA,"CV AND publication list If an application asks for both a CV and a separate publication list, first off why? Do they just want the same information from the CV re-pasted here? Also, is it appropriate to include bioRxiv preprints in the publication list? (I do list them on my CV in a separate section). 2) No idea why unless they ask for the top 3 or summaries of key papers.  Yes, list preprints.  Definitely.  3) Don't list preprints for papers that are already published and listed elsewhere on your CV.  No one cares and it looks like you're trying to double-count.  And don't list preprints for upcoming submissions in the same section in which you list your published papers.  Again, no one really cares, and it will appear as if you are trying to pass off preprints as peer-reviewed publications.  If you are going to include preprints, list them under ""In preparation"" or ""In review"" section.4) if this is for one of the Finnish jobs, the CV there is short and does not include publications"

If they're on the committee they'll see it.  And if they want to help you they will. Emailing will only make things more awkward. 4) Absolutely send them an email. Use your networks. If they aren't involved with the search, they might be able to put in a word to have your app looked at more closely. There is no way contacting somebody you know personally would ever be perceived awkwardly or negatively.  5) If they love you they will go to the SC and say you are awesome.  If they don't, they will ask the SC how your app looks.   You'd have to be pretty far off their list for them to do much to hurt your chances. 6) Definitely do it. That is the way I got my two interviews honestly speaking.  I got interviews only where I had insider and got in touch with them.  Committes receive 100-500 applications (recently received a rejection from U of Michigan stating they got 460 apps) so you have to find a way to make your application popping out from that list (unless you are clearly a rock-star)  X2 7) Agree, this cannot hurt and will most likely help a little bit. Just make sure to keep the message brief! 8) distant second cousins once removed who I don't remember (but who, apparently, know me) have emailed me about a search in my department, asking a simple question. Didn't hurt them. When this happens I send a brief reply back with any relevant info I can provide, and (per HR's rules) I also forward the email exchange to the SC chair.

For example, I find it hard to believe only 26 people applied for the Conservation position at UCSC and I know from my own interviews that the number in this column can be 2-6 times what is listed. 2) Last year it was between 5x and 7x for the jobs which I knew the total application figures. The year before that it was 10x to 12x. Generally anything here that is >10 will be extremely competitive. X 3 3) There is no correction factor, just wild speculation 4) I'm not sure having something like this (even if were feasible to calculate) would be useful. Honestly it shouldn't matter how many people are applying, because it wouldn't/shouldn't change your package at all. We all know it's hard and there are likely alot of people applying, just submit your stuff to the best of your abilities. That's all we can do really. 5) I did the math for a job search at my university (R1) and x=8.6. ymmv. 6) @5, was it an eco or evo search?  Indiana's Evolution search is 10x, which seems high."

I think there are some flaws in a lot of Jeremy's analyses and conclusions, but I generally appreciate seeing some data on the faculty job market since most of it is so opaque. x4 8) A Dynamic Ecology blogger went through IRB to conduct a simple poll on their website in 2016.

How could that possibly require IRB approval? x2 13) Well I sure wouldn't want these complainers as colleagues. X8 14) I think the main conclusion I'm drawing is that as ecologists, we should all get training on what requires an IRB and what doesn't, as it appears opaque. I know I've never had that training. 15) Asking people to send information which may not yet be public (for any number of reasons) is kinda bogus, even if he promises to keep the data confidential. I can't see how this doesn't violate some IRB guideline. 16) Comments on the blog page for this announcement are disabled. As are the comments for the page announcing the preprint.

I usually include some sort of statement throughout my documents that says something like ""I use quantitative field and lab methods to do X, Y and Z..."" I don't get into the specifics but make sure to repeat the word quantitative in several places in my application materials 5) I think more often than not it means hardcore stats or modeling or programming. I find if I am wondering if my work is hardcore enough for one of these positions, then it isn't. x2 6) Apply unless they specifically request a certain skillset as essential.7) I always think of a 'quantitative ecologist' as someone who is developing and testing new statistical models and methods or working primarily to test ecological theory, but I don't think that is what the majority of people consider 'quantitative'. Ecology data is complex, and I find a lot of field ecologists are doing advanced quantitative methods even if they don't describe themselves as 'quantitative' per se.  7) A quantitative biologist is someone who is well-steeped in mathematical theory relevant to what they are studying and who uses computational approaches as an integral part of their research program. This is in contrast to someone who knows how to use a couple of shareware programs for their specific research program but who otherwise lacks a coherent and broad conceptual/mathematical/statistical understanding of their discipline that they apply to their research. So, for instance, a straight-up naturalist, who may rely on ecological theory and use t-tests and regressions for their published articles, would not be a quantitative biologist, except under a very charitable (and useless) definition. This is not to say that naturalists are not incredably valuable, good scientists; I am not making the claim that quantitative biologists are ""better"" than naturalists -- I'm just illustrating how they are different to clarify the definition of a quantitative biologist. Also, someone can be both a naturalist AND a quantitative biologist, just as someone can be a heart surgeon AND a corporate tax attorney; that doesn't mean that naturalists and quantitative biologists are the same thing, or that heart surgeons and corporate tax attorneys are the same thing. But they are different expertises.8) Regarding the UCR ad, ""Systems"" means organ systems, e.g. digestive, vascular, muscular, etc... well and also endocrine systems.

I would hope that if someone did get an offer they can put us all out of our misery. That's too bad that the dept chair hasn't emailed you back. 216) FYI for my fellow UTSA eco interviewees: I'm accepting an offer from a different school on Monday. Probably doesn't matter to you guys and won't make a difference but I'm happy about it. I just wanted to share the news. So sorry about this search. Good Luck to you guys!! 217) Congrats!! 218) Another weekend...still nothing...It's disappointing to not get any reply from the sc/chair. Overall, they seemed like nice people who would indeed send an update note or something, especially in response to an email.  I've had pretty good treatment from other departments.

Take it one step further and when you know who the search committee members, CHECK OUT THEIR WEBSITES (if they have one). Again, you will undoubtedly be able to predict whether you will be treated with respect or like this... (pre-interview reject here, btw).(219) Amazingly, I was offered the position. I have been an occasional poster above. I can't tell you what has been up with the SC or department head, in terms of how or if they will initiate contact with others at this point. I can only say that I was given an initial offer. I do also know that their was (and still is...) concern about the budget cut. I certainly hope that the person interested in collaborating still is, I know I am. (220) Congrats to 216 and 219 on your offers! I also interviewed here (posts 54/129/182) and as my first interview (and first year on the market) this has been quite an experience. Fingers crossed for smoother running searches in the future! 221) Onlooker here, congrats! What do you mean by congrats to other 2 interviewees on their offer here? Did the other two decline offers from UTSA? (222) 220 edited for clarity. 223) Hi 219, thanks for posting and good luck! 224) #195 here, finally UTSA made up its mind! Congrats #219. Make sure you read all the posts scattered through out this wiki about lone ecologist concerns. To be blunt: my advice is to start planning your exit strategy now.

I know places do it pretty commonly, but sending a letter with an electronic signature to a campus interviewee is pretty lame. At least take the time to sign the thing after all the work we put into the interview. 230) Same as 229. Typos and stamped signature on ultrashort impersonal letter= lame. The whole process, to this lame letter, definitely confirmed my suspicions about this department. It's pretty sad.

By that time, the interviewees here had posted that they were finished with interviews. 246) To the person who got the offer, do you know if UTSA bio will be hiring again next year? What's the scoop on the integrative bio expansion? I didn't apply this year but wouldn't mind applying next year to a school closer to my spouse who's at A&M. 247) Still nothing. Anyone, anything? please! (248) Search is over; your letter was lost in the mail or not sent (not sent most likely given how things were run). 249) Thanks 248. The latter is probably the case. I just find the complete lack of professionalism very disturbing. I'm not ranting because I didn't get the position, nor am I disgruntled. I wish all the best to whoever got an offer. But, I'm just perplexed by the dubious and inadequate handling of the interviewed candidates (rejects).  Was I that bad? Did I offend them during my presentation? Did I do something to deserve the cold shoulder? 250) I'm sure you weren't bad, did not offend anyone, and did not do anything that warrants this snub. The whole thing is over and just be glad you don't have to work with those people. 251) Ouch! Well, if by any minor chance the department is searching again next season for the alleged ecology expansion, I sure hope that this year's new hire will contribute to a smoother, professional search. Best wishes and good luck to the new hire! 252) Has the offer been accepted? 253) Uh ohhh...(254) PLEASE STOP. JUST AN ONLOOKER HERE, BUT THIS IS ABSURD. I'M SURE WHOEVER THE PERSON IS WHO KEEPS DRAGGING THIS ON IS NOT AS INSANE AS THEY APPEAR HERE, BUT IT'S OVER JUST STOP THE INSANITY! 255) Onlooker here too. I agree this post is ridiculously long.

Non-TT faculty could possibly go under ""Faculty Jobs"" - they ARE Faculty Jobs after all - and we rename Non-TT to Postdocs?

I'm positive both of them would give me a strong recommendation letter so I'm not really sure what to do. The committee member is more 'famous' overall than my master's advisor (better published, etc), but my master's advisor is more well-known in the field of this specific job I'm applying to. What are good guidelines for chosing professional references? 2) My MSc advisor told me that the times that it doesn't work to have a MSc advisor as a reference is when their letter reads more like a letter for an application to grad school. The letter only works when the MSc advisor has kept up withyour work and can provide comments about what you are doing now. I used my MSc advisor as a reference because I was so early in my postdoc that I didn't think my postdoc advisor would provide substantial comments and I got a position last year, so I gues it worked. 3) From my experience on search committees, we don't know 99% of the people writing letters for you, so it doesn't really matter. And when we do see a huge name, it's not something that we use to justify a non-competitive application packet.

But thanks again to the volunteers who make this possible.",NA,"how many years on the market? Wondering how many years people stay on the market before moving on to alt-ac or non-ac jobs? I'm sure it depends on individual circumstances of course, but wondering if anyone has said ""this is my last year before I move on"" or ""I'll give it X years on the market and if still no permanent position, I'll do something else"" 2) totally understand this train of thought. I thought last year would be my last year (16/17), but got 3 on campus interviews, and like double phone interviews...so the most positive response so far. I did not get an offer and was very bummed, but the seeming proximity to an offer had me apply this year (my 4th year of applicatiosn - ack). This is def my last year, and will be looking at alt-ac/non-ac positions come Feb if nothing happens. 3) Due to personal/family stuff, I am giving myself exactly 1 year on the job market and then will happily move on to a non-academic job. The instability of my job situation is unhealthy for my spouse/family - who come before my career, honestly - as well as for my own mental health.x2  4) this is my last year too.  I've done 2 post-docs and am tired of moving my family around.  The idea of waiting until the fall of 2018 in the hopes that *this time* I'll get a position, which I can start in fall of 2019 is not appealing (plus my funding runs out next spring) 5) I'm giving myself 2 seasons post-PhD (applied to a few as ABD)... but after that, sayonara academia! I'm not a glutton for punishment 6) I am single, can move anywhere, and starting in the first year of my post-doc. There is funding for me to stay here at least three years but I am continually applying for TT jobs. I am approaching 40 :/ so I will probably start considering non-academic jobs after three years. 7) The problem is that switching to an alt-ac/non-ac job would probably also take at least a couple of years to do successfully and could also involve moving. At least for my specialty, there isn't a clear way to transition to a non-faculty job without a pretty major career transition. If there were an actual offer on the table in front of me for a stable job outside of academia I would be very tempted after 5 years of applying for jobs (1st year was only to a couple as an ABD, but still). 8) If you're able to fully fund your retirement as a postdoc, it's great to hold on... otherwise, an 'alt-ac' job, even if entry level, will likely pay better than postdoc-ing, and allow you to do so. 9) I don't really disagree with your advice #8, but I think you overestimate the ease of just stepping into even an entry level alt-ac job. Certain backgrounds (e.g. heavy lab experience) would make it easier, I'm sure. 10) @8: a lot of starting ""alt-ac"" jobs I've looked at and friends have taken pay well more than a postdoc, or even more than a tenured professor! 11) @8 here. Yes, @10, that was exactly my point. Staying multiple years in a postdoc (and probably, even getting an asst. professor position at most institutions) is undermining future earnings compared to an entry level ""alt-ac"" job. 12) I'm still confused about what these alt-ac jobs are that you think you can step right into (even at entry level) from a postdoc (though I agree 100% that if that is an option it is pretty attractive especially if you have some option that would pay you more than a tt professor!). 13) If your research is related to environmental issues in any way, there are private environmental consulting firms who hire entry-level PhDs at decent salaries with good benefits, and you can often do meaningful technical work there. 14) That is not quite accurate either, 13, the vast majority (>85 percent) of consulting jobs exist because of the Natonal Environmental Policy Act of 1970 which, among many things, requires compliance with discharge regulations and necessitates environmental impact statements.The jobs require knowledge of NEPA, which also dictates and guides an entire additional group of state and local regulations. People that do research in ecology and environmental science often don’t know anything about NEPA compliance, regulations, or permitting in general, and cannot really transfer their skills to the needs of these jobs. They may know the fate of NOx from a smokestack, but they generally don’t have a good grasp on the process of getting a permit to emit it or how to write technical reports responding to monitoring it. The other 15 % of jobs likely require knowledge of wetland delineation from the Army Corps of Engineers guide, which many peple who research environmental issues have no clue how to do. 15) Agree with #14. I'm not sure where one gets the NEPA training, and I'm less sure I would find it appealing. 16) 13 here - That is certainly true, #14, that consulting jobs do require knowledge of all types of federal, state, and local regulations.  Having actually had one of these jobs where I was hired as an entry-level MS, I found that these regulations can be learned on the job, hence the entry-level position. To #15, whether you find this kind of job appeealing is an entirely different question.  All I'm saying is that it pays well, has good benefits, and is a stable job. I quit to get a PhD, so interpret as you will! 17) You can learn wetland dileation procedures in a day, and consulting companies bring in people with ecology PhDs and train them on the regulations all the time. There's also consulting work out there studying / working with varius listed rare species. 18) https://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2014/07/03/a-career-as-an-environmental-consultant-guest-post/ 19) I'm a PhD working on NEPA stuff now as a consultant. I only got the job because a friend of mine works at the company and gave me an in - I have no prior NEPA experience. It's not hard to pick up on the job, but it's hard to convince someone to hire you. A lot of the big firms will bill $150/hr for your time and pay you $25/hr. I think a lot PhD ecologists may fare better in the data analytics world because you have real skills there that people value, and they are probably far less rigid than federal agencies in terms of the ""check off the box experience"" screening that comes before a person looks at your application. As someone on the other side of the fence, the process of getting here involves a lot of getting turned down for jobs you're qualified for, but it can pay well and result in highly decent colleagues. 20) Thanks for the encouraging words 1)OP here... Agree that one of the biggest challenges in making a career change (whether alt-ac or taking a full left [or maybe right? pun intended] turn) is convincing someone to hire you when your skill set isn't an exact match. I also think though that we've been trained (brainwashed?) to think that we are only truly qualified for jobs that are a goldilocks fit. Don't quote me on it, but I believe there are online courses that provide some NEPA training. Some may even be free MOOCS, so if you're wanting to go that direction, you could at least do a course and slap it on your CV to check a KSA box. I'm one year out and applied to several jobs as ABD and had two campus interviews and a couple of phone interviews but no offer. From a personal life standpoint I *could* move around, but it would not be ideal and this is primarily what drives my leanings towards letting this year (*maybe* next) be my final year on the market. That and as #8 alluded to, I'm tired of being relatively poor on my pithy postdoc ""salary"" that has no benefits (none!)... I could make almost as much as a bank teller at our local branch or an admin assistant at the local school and at least that would include health insurance... It looks like family life and/or personal life (plus money) are big reasons people move on to non-TT jobs, but my follow up question is whether or not there's a gender bias there. Are those of you who are getting out of the hunger games (er, academic market) for personal life reasons women or men? 22) I'm female, married, and limiting my years of academic searching based on long-term financial stability/goals. My partner is willing to move should I get a faculty job, so he's not 'holding me back' from staying in the game longer 23) I'm male, married, kids, 4th year postdoc and this is likely my last year unless a giant grant comes through to fund me in my current postdoc institution for longer. Also considering industry, start-ups, and program management. Have applied, gotten interviews, and considered offers in the alt-ac world but nothing has come up yet that we were ready to make the jump for - either too risky or not in a good place. All this is happening at the same time - the past two years have been a continuous job season. I really need something to work for my family and I don't see that has ""holding me back"" - in retrospect I'm glad my wife talked me out of some job offers. Those were tough decisions... I think there is a gender bias - based on my count I know many men in academia whose female spouses have put careers on hold so they could move to the new city and raise kids while daddy starts his professor job. I personally know zero women where this is the case, although there must be some instances. 24) Male, married, kids, 4th year postdoc. Still applying and not truly considering alt-ac. Have some continued funding for at least a couple years at my current postdoc (which I really like...if only it weren't temporary). My wife is also an academic, adjunct teaching here (postdocs are rare in her field) and in the same boat. We are both applying and will have to make decisions about where we move or what we accept when one of us has an offer.",NA,"Turned down from on-site interview last year, should I reapply this year? Last year I applied for a job at an R1 Uni and I was fortunate to get an on-site interview (6 people total). I went through that process, and although it went OK. I didn’t get the job so it obviously it didn’t go well enough. I do know they offered it to at least 2 people ahead of me. This Dept has a strong focus in area X, and dabbles in area Y (my field). I don’t do any research in area X, but the 2 offers they made last year made it clear that they were targeting area X (#2 accepted position). This year they are searching yet again, and I’m wondering whether I should re-apply. I feel somewhat dejected, but hey I need a job so part of me feels I should swallow my pride and try again. The other part of me thinks the Dept got a good look at me last year and what I have to offer, and they already said no so I should move on. Should I reach out to the search chair committee and inquire whether I should even bother? Its hard for me to look at this with an objective mind, because of sour grapes plus I don’t really know how they felt about my interview last year. I liked the Uni, the Dept was an OK fit though I’m not convinced on their obsession with their focus area, and I had reservations about the location (its in the most expensive area of the US). Any advice would be appreciated. 2) If you were on-site (presumably 1 of 3 or 4) and not offered after the first 2 declined, I think that's a pretty clear message. I wouldn't reapply. 3) OP here, updated info. Offer #2 accepted, 6 people total interviewed so I don't know where I stood in their rankings. 4) Couldn't hurt to apply. I have an on-campus this year at a place where I didn't pass a phone interview last go-around. 5) I would apply x3 6) What would you gain by not applying? 7) OP here, The only benefit to not applying is to save some pride, but seeing how I'm used to swallowing my pride at this point I guess I have nothing to lose. My only question remains, do I contact the search chair and give him a heads up or ask if they will re-consider me? Or should I just apply and let it be. It just feels a bit awkward so I'm wondering how I should navigate this if I re-apply. 8) I would treat this as any other job, apply for it and forget about it. x3 9) ""Dear Search Chair, As you already know that I applied for this position last year, and was invited for the on-campus interview, but didn't get the job, I'm wondering at this point what are my chances to receive another reconsideration let alone the offer? I'm still very interested for the position, but thought would ask you before officially applying as I was considered for on-campus interview for the same position last year. In the mean time, I did achieve X, and Y in the areas that would be assets in the proposed position. Please let me know. Sincerely, ABCD.""  - I would write this to the search chair first. If you don't get any good response, I wouldn't apply. The main reason is that instead of reaching out to you, they re-advertised the position again. That's pretty clear a No-No to me. 10) If you liked the place, absolutely go for it. I think it's easy to underestimate the amount of regret you may have if you don't.11) You're waaaaay over-thinking this.  You don't know why you weren't higher, if they liked you they will interview you again, and if not, oh well.  I've seen multiple people interview in the same department in multiple years, and at least one of those got an offer the 2nd time. #9's email is awkward and will not necessarily elicit an honest response (due to HR rules more than anythign else).  As always if you have any connections to the department you could ask them why you didn't get the offer, but assuming you don' thave any connections-- apply.  Your previous interview means you know more about the department and so have more to say in your cover letter than most. 12) I agree with 11 about the overthinking part. If the first hire was because the other candidates have great expertise in X and you are Y but they invited you anyways... that might mean that they were interested in you despite that lack of perfect fit. They only hired one person. That doesn't mean they didn't like the other candidates. If this was a failed search then I could see a reason for not applying again, but remember that they liked you enough to bring you on campus. As you said, the other candidates ultimately fitthe specific position better. Now that they have filled that spot, maybe you can mention how your expertise in Y would lead to potential synergisms with the candidate that was hired for X. Just thinking out loud here. Don't make it about your pride (easier said than done, I know, I'm not saying that it would be easy for me... just trying to provide an outside perspective). 13) OP Here, I emailed the search chair last week and told him I was considering re-applying and gave him a soft ball question regarding what they might be looking for, it was just something to respond to. I haven't heard back so far, but I'll be re-applying anyway. 14) You did the opposite of what everyone told you. ",NA,"Moving from R2 to R1 What defines an R2? I'm looking at a job in a university listed as an R2 but I'm targeting only R1s. I looked at the department and they seem to be very productive in terms of research. Is it possible to move from an R2 to an R1? 2) You can have productive R2s that are better places to do research than some R1s, and a lot of R2s are actively trying to provide the support for their researchers, specifically to hit R1 status. If you're seeing an R2 that looks like an R1, provides you the support of an R1, and has a solid non-toxic working environment, I don't think it matters if it's actually an R1. 3) If you get grants and run a productive lab at an R2, it's definitely possible to move to an R1. 4) Isn't R1-3 just a measure of # of phds? I've seen R3s that are super productive but small schools/specialized programs. I would go for any of the Rs 5) Official Carnegie R status is based on conferred degrees, research activity, and reserach expenditures. The specifics are detailed here http://carnegieclassifications.iu.edu/classification_descriptions/basic.php. 6) There are definitely differences between the average R1 and R2 schools I've visited. Most R2s have more teaching requirements and fewer requirements for obtaining grants to get tenure. R1 departments have way more postdocs. The actual research infrastructure (field stations, shared facilities, etc.) is often similar between them, though. 7) In this market, it's definitely worth applying to an R2 school even if you have it in mind that an R1 is where you want to be. Like anything, the devil's in the details. My school is R2 and I'm in a terrific department with a number of productive colleagues -- it's a good environment and that's what matters most, but it's hard to assess this accurately without being there in person. Apply, and you can always turn it down if it doesn't feel like a good fit. 8) Don't just assume that an R1 necessarily has better research support for the department you are applying for - some smaller R1s make the Carnegie classification solely because of their Med schools - super variable in terms of research support among R2s - you need to look at the department level, not just the Carnegie classification 9) I agree that you shouldn't assume R1s are better - in many cases, at R2 you have more freedom to pursue your research interests without the cuthroat nature of R1 departments and the stressors of needing to bring in money year after year, and many R2 schools are very research productive (and so are many small, liberal arts colleges that don't even have graduate students). I think what you should really look for is somewhere you want to be to do the work you want to do.  If you are productive anywhere (grants, publications) you CAN move up - I've known people who have gone from small, UG only liberal arts schools to R1s - although that doesn't mean it would be easy.  I generally like the quality of life at an R2 better than an R1, for whatever thats worth. 10) I'm also at an R2, my start-up, salary and department investment in lab renovations were similar to R1s in the region. There are fewer postdocs here, but everyone is well funded, and we have a 1:1 or 1:2 teaching load. Mine University is a state schoole, and it's the one without the med school. I think this drags is more to the in"

They were obviously biased towards Emilys. 8) ha! seeking a job makes everyone paranoid 9) Statistically, assuming men and women are equally probable to be asked for each interview slow, you should expect a slate of 6 females 1/64 times... and there are over 300 jobs currently posted on the wiki 10) Unrelated to gender, but two of the two candidates whom I happened to chose to Google are both already asst. professors elsewhere. 11) @10- Yep, I saw that too, and it at least made me feel better about not making the cut (and note schools to look for openings at next year!) 12) I've been thinking about this issue a bit, and talking with a few colleagues about whether it's a problem to have a slate of 6 female interviewees. I understand why it may look weird to some people, and why others find it to be no problem. For us, it came down to figuring out what the historical issues are, and how to best proceed in the future. Historically, females have been excluded/discriminated against in the hiring process. (I hope we can all agree on that.) But there are two equally reasonable ways to think about moving forward, and this is where I think the conflict arises. First, recognize that gender discrimination has occured in the past, and try to set hiring criteria that recognize contributions made by all genders such that gender is no longer an implicit consideration for hiring.(This could lead to occassional all-female or all-male interview lists.) Second, recognize that the result of past gender discrimitation has led to fewer slots for women, and trying to (partially) fix that by actively making sure women are being considered. (This could lead to occassional all-female interview lists, but would make all-male interview lists unacceptable.) Each person and each school chooses their own approach, but either way, I don't think an all-female interview group is unreasonable. 13) Man here. Please come up with a list enumerating the number of all women vs. all men candidate lists before complaining about a single all-woman slate. And if you still feel cheesed about the deal, please post your CV so we can compare it to the candidates. Thanks in advance.  14) Thank you @13 for not immediately playing a ""discrimination against men"" card for the existence of a single all-female interview pool 15) yep, I've neer seen an all female interview panel but have seen plenty of all male ones! kind of refreshing.  I was a little surprised by the candidates - they're all highly qualified but they seemed to put more value than I expected on having on the ground teaching experience 16)  How about we choose the best candidates regardless of sexual orientation, race, or religion? 17) because we have a history of centuries of systematic bias and a responsibility to correct that moving forward. Young women of color (for example) deserve mentors who aren't all straight white cis males. 18) hey 16 - I hope we don't ever end up at the same institution  19) Dear Job Seekers, I just don't see why you would hire a woman over a man. They have smaller brains, and are incapable of proper science. Sincerely, Francis Crick.  20) #4 here- I apprecate the perspective from 12 and 9 - These may have been the top 6. I didn't make this comment out of bitterness from not advancing. There are efforts to correct for bias in gender/race through programs such as LSAMP, REU, NSF postdocs for underrepresented groups... My point is that bias correction should be completed before the professional stage. If a search committee is actively inviting based on a diverse candidate pool, it shouldn't be at the exclusion of another group. 21) Yeah, that totally corrects for implicit biases that affect women at the faculty level.... 22) I think that most of the research suggests that the biggest barrier points to retaining gender diversity in academia are not at the hiring stage, but at other career stages. Dynamic ecology has a few posts on hires in ecology over the last few years and they are actually slightly tipped toward more women (which may just represent the gender balance of ecology anyway). 23) My subfield is nowhere near parity, so the whole ""if you intverview a single woman, she won't get hired"" phenomenon often applies. 24) 22 again, yes I think there is probably a lot of heterogeneity between subfields even if the field as a whole is pretty good (at the hiring stage anyway). 25) I'm female, as feminist as they come, and I'm a little uncomfortable with the derogatory attitudes being expressed here towards the original post. This is legitimately a hard question, and in all honesty, one that a hiring committee could reasonably have anticipated. Maybe they did, and went ahead anyway. As #12 pointed out, there are so many ways to tackle issues of diversity, some at odds with each other, that disagreements are going to arise. Engaging in a derogatory manner doesn't help your view look better. (I'm looking at you, too, #16 - that's not a great or informed response either.) And also, I don't love the reasoning that it's ok to have 6 females interviewees because there used to be lots of all-male panels. There are lots of reasons why it might be ok, but that seems like a you-did-it-first type of argument that doesn't carry much moral weight. 26) Macalaster candidates aside (though I honestly don't think it's unreasonable to have 6 excellent ecologist happen to be women--look at gender composition coming out of most ecoevo PhD programs), I think it is COMPLETELY reasonable for SCs to have a bias for candidates who give the department something new (when all else approx. equal). Most ""diversity"" hires aren't trying to acheive diversity in their pool of candidates--they are trying to make their departments more diverse. When programs are still filed with white guys, candidate pools should favor good women/POC/LGBT scientists. x3 27) I wonder if mandatory retirement might help solve some of this. As it is, this is yet another example of bad behavior in an older generation negatively affecting the next generation. Perhaps the older generation should step up and take some responsibility, and clear some of the ranks to let younger scientists (male, female, white, black, etc) have a clean(er) slate. Isn't this what emeritus appointments are good for? Letting people carry on with some of their work, while opening up their faculty line to a new person?   27)  I like how people are calling out the person who said that the best qualified candidate for the job should be the person who gets the job.  (""Content of one's character rather than the colour of one's skin""?  Whoever expressed that sentiment must be some kind of alt-right monster...) Perhaps we should consider treating individuals as individuals rather than as members of arbitrary and mostly meaningless groups that they happen to have been born into. 13) But the basis of this whole thread is that an all-woman interview list creates an assumption of bias while an all-male interview list is so common it is literally not worth mentioning here. Someone was so moved by the all -woman list that they posted about it. I've been on these boards for three years and nobody has EVER started a thread about an all-man interview list.This is the fact from which all debate flowed. 28) ""mostly meaningless""?? Statistics don't lie, and the problems are so much deeper and more pressing than us arguing here about some academic hire 29) @27, this type of statement is insidious, because it completely neglects history. It fails to comprehend that bias exists, still exists, in hiring committees. In addition, who sets the criteria upon which hiring decisions are made? Are service accomplishments, which women have more of and are an asset to universities, considered in hiring decisions? This whole system has been, for a long time, set up to favor a certain type of candidate. Saying that somehow the ""most qualified"" candidate should get the job, as the previous poster pointed out, ignores much deeper issues. Please don't paper over those issues with gauzy statements of individuality. 30) Classic libertarian misinterpretation of MLK by #27. I can tell you that I don't get treated as ""an individual"". Not in the street, and not at work. 31) #25, you wrote exactly what I was thinking reading this thread. Thank you for being reasonable!  32) Would love to hear the interpretation of MLK that requires that individuals of one ethnicity/faith/etc. be favoured over another.  I'm sure your interpretation is the only ""correct"" one, and all others must be incorrect. 33) Did you miss the part where MLK demanded compensatory measures? 13) @32: the interpretation that follows directly from his words: ""A society that has done something special against the Negro for hundreds of years must now do something special for the Negro."" x3 33) just as a note, SLACs tend to be more appealing to many female candidates (for reasons that are obvious and I won't reiterate here), and R1s tend to attract a higher ratio of male candidates. The women who were chosen for this specific hire rather reflect those divergent ratios. I would be amazed to see a slate of 6 women as the invites for an R1, but we have all exerienced all male campus invites for R1s. Let's be Bayesian about this and remember the skewed applicant pools (having served on both R1 and SLAC selection committees). 34) If being Bayesian is making assumptions with no data, then I guess we can be Bayesian? Here are some frequentist numbers, however, that don't support those Bayesian assumptions: http://www.pnas.org/content/112/17/5360. More important, I feel bad for the candidates of the job that they should look on this board at this discussion for so many reasons - the least of which that everyone immediately assumed that they actually all identify as women. Maybe that is another Bayesian approach, I am not sure. This entire process is such a miserable slog and the first reaction to someone's success is to assume the game is rigged. To use a term from a blowhard covered in Cheeto dust...SAD. Here is to you, Macalester interviewee, you made it and I am happy for you! Best of luck in your interview and career. (x3) 35) So because all men lists have occured, it's ok for all female lists to remedy the problem? Strikes me as an SC over ambitious about solving gender equality in department now.right.this.minute. 36) Yep. Nothing overambitious about it. http://curt-rice.com/2014/07/03/2-ways-quotas-for-women-raise-quality/ 13) @35, this is super simple. All man interview slates go without saying because it's assumed it can just happen due to chance. The second an all-woman panel occurs, it can't even be conceived of as chance - it must be a conspiracy against guys. The fact you can't conceive of women getting interviews without some conspiracy kinda says it all. 36) It's interesting to see the comparison:  when very often interviewees are all males, they say ""simply don't have enough strong female candidates""; when occasionally all interviewees are all females, they say ""this is not the right way to address diversity issue"" indicating diversity is the main factor here.x1 37) All-male interview lists have gotten the side-eye (and more) for a while now, with increasing recognition of this problem in the past 5-10 years. I would be hugely surprised, and people would raise a huge (and rightful) ruckus, at an all-male 6-person interview list this year. Maybe this is different in other parts of the country or at certain schools, but I don't see it slipping past anyone to have that happen anymore. Double hypocrisy doesn't make all-female lists OK. Taking steps to remedy the skewed gender balance, especially at the school or department level, may well make it reasonable, or it's possible that indeed, it happened by chance. Let's stop comparing this to the all-male panels of the past - those happened for different reasons, which are hopefully being weeded out of current hiring practices. 13) I'll stop comparing it to all-man lists when you start raising a ruckus about all-man interview lists. Deal? 39) I went on an interview where I was clearly the only woman who was shortlisted within the last year. In a department that took pride in working towards gender balance, supposedly. Just because you didn't see the candidate seminar list doesn't mean it doesn't happen. Someone I spoke to recently was in a similar situation, and found that they hadn't even bothered to provide her with some information the other candidates received beforehand. Lots of places seem to pat themselves on the back for finding a woman to interview and think their work is done, even if they don't hire her. 40) yikes, 39, that's terrible. Do you think the problem is pervasive throughout the department, or is it being driven by a higher proportion of older faculty? 41) @13, I... find your style distasteful, even though I think we're aiming for the same things. By all means, if there are all-male candidate lists, lets call them out! But by virtue of that argument, once there stop being lots of all-male lists (which I do think is legitimately on the decline), there would no longer be any reason to have all-female lists. That argument shoots itself in the foot. 13) 41, if you've been on here complaining about ONE all-woman list, then I don't think we aim for the same thing. I'm arguing you are showing substantial bias if you assume all-woman lists indicate concerted action to exclude men when you (and everyone else on this board) have not made a peep about all-man lists. An all-woman list should not be assumed to be an example of double hypocrisy - but your assumption it does speak volumes. 41, again) I'm tired of this. Your assumption that I have been arguing against an all-female list is laughable. I'm not the original poster, nor #27b, nor #16... I think you mistake people disliking your rhetoric for disliking your desired outcome. An all-woman list is fine - arguing that it is fine BECAUSE OF ALL THE MALE LISTS is not great. That is the double hypocrisy, and not seeing past (what's coming across as) your red-eyed rage is what I find distasteful. I am actually female, actually experience all the crap that is dished out in all it's various forms at women, and I find your rhetoric distasteful. (I say this in response to your first comment, saying you are male. Allies are great! Hooray!) I am arguing for a strong moral position, not (what seems to me to be) a school-yard response of it's ok for me to do it if you did it first. That's how that argument sounds to me. See, we do want the same thing. I am angry at how women are treated in academia, and have been for a long time, and have been arguing for change for over a decade, and have seen progress. Let's not stop. +100 to 41's response! 42) Honest question here: Some fields in ecology are male dominated, some are even female dominated. Do SCs take this into account? Should ratios like this matter? If you are in, for example a 70% male sub-field, is it wise or challenging to limit the pool to the 30% minority. Ah - these are tough questions!!! 43) I was part of an all female slate in 2011.  There was one woman in the department.  She was retiring, and we were interviewing to replace her.  There were no women in any other science departments or math.  All male departments are still common many places, especially smaller schools.",NA,"How does it work? Perhaps this is a ridiculous question, but here we go. When hired on a 9 month Asst Prof. appointment at an R1, where is the money for your salary coming from? Once your first 3-5 years are finished, are you expected to pay your own salary from grant money? I know many people increase their annual earnings by getting summer slary from grants. My question is about the 9-month base pay, if a gap in funding occurs. 2) Base pay comes from the uni. It's base. It's what you get no matter what. 3) Thank you!",NA,"Research statements vs plans How much should you emphasize research plans in your research statement (even as much as 'did' vs 'doing' vs 'going to do (especially at X university)'? I recognize some insitutions ask for research plans, which seems like it should include more intentions in addition to accomplished research.  2) Future research plans may be even more important than past work.  You need to show the committee the kind of research you want to do in the future so they know what kind of scientist you are.  Some searches divide these into 2 docs.  2 pages on past, 2-3 on future or for short form apps 1 page past 1-2 for future.  3) I did one page past, 1 page future and was quite successful. 4) I get so much conflicting advice on this. Several 'advice' columns and colleagues have said that long future plans are superfluous and makes you look like you don't have clear direction. in other words, you should be able to articulate clear steps for the next 5 years in 2-3 paragraphs but the majority of the statemnet should be about past and current work. 5) I think it depends on the place -- at some places they want to see that you have a long-term, 20 year vision. But most of your space should probably be devoted to your first couple of proposed grants."
NA,"University of Arkansas To those who e-mailed their Vert. Biol. applications to the search chair, did you get an acknowledgment of receipt? (I didn't) (1) Me neither.(2) Yep, a long time ago. I got a snail mail letter dated December 4th. (3) Now that you mention it, I (resp. 1) think I did get a letter. (4) I got a letter too. (5) nothing, however, the committee chair said they will be assembling a short list in a few weeks.  Apparently the competition is very keen. ",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Teaching experience I get the sense from the Macalester interview pool that the small and liberal arts schools that I would like to work at really do value teaching experience. I have six years of TA teaching experience, but it really seems like you should be 'the instructor of record' somewhere. My postdoc institution has a teaching certificate program, but I am wondering if I should just become an adjunct instructor and teach a night class at a local community or technical college instead? I was hoping someone might have some insight into this - thanks. 2) Yeah, I would think that most SLACs would require at least one or two years of instructor-of-record status. 3) As a postdoc, I spent a fair amount of effort to be allowed to teach 2 classes plus a lab class, which I hoped would get me the experience as ""instructor of record"" needed to be considered for a SLAC position. I have had interviews at R1s, but haven't so much as gotten a bite at any SLACs, and I have no idea why.  4) Hate to sound like a jerk, but I think some committees would be more impressed with a class or certificate in whatever trendy buzzwords in teaching practice are than actual experience. I don't even know what they want any more, and I don't think they do, either. 5) Totally depends on the school/committee, but my instructor of record experience fared very well at a few SLACs (I had a teaching certificate too- no idea if that mattered). They will also ask you a lot about teaching in phone/on-campus interviews and, having now seen R1 folks interview for SLAC jobs, it becomes very obvious who has/hasn't had teaching experience and/or thought about teaching. Commonly candidates spend a lot of time on their research docs/talks and look great, but then bomb the teaching philosophy/teaching talk. #1, you might consider having someone from a SLAC take a look at your application materials. Maybe your research is coming across as very well thought out but the teaching not as much (not saying you aren't great, but maybe they just can't see it!). Getting instructor of record experience by adjuncting is also a great idea. 6) SLAC applicants have become quite savvy about getting teaching experience and being up-to-date with respect to pedagogical approaches.  More and more applicants have extensive teaching experience, either as a VAP somewhere or in a teahcing/pedagogical postdoc.  It is tricky because applicants are also expected to maintain research productivity.  Certificates and teaching awards are a nice touch but nothing substitutes for IOR experience and being able to refelct thoughtfully on that experience in a teaching statement. 7) I get why SLAC search committees will jump at people with this teaching experience, but I find it so frustrating that most of the people I know getting good SLAC jobs already have done a VAP or are assistant profs at smaller schools (like most of the Macalester candidates). This career already takes 6+ years for a PhD, a few years for a postdoc, and NOW a few more years for a VAP or temporary job with yet another move and more years of uncertainty. In my second postdoc I've done all the teaching I can but I have never been at a school that had any mechanism to allow grad students or postdocs to teach a legitimate class as instructor of record. Adjuncting at night is not going to happen (have kids and already work too many hours). 8) 6 again - definitely feel the frustration.  I never considered a VAP becaused it seemed like a lot to ask of the family for a likely very challenging 1-year commitment.  Engaging in trainings and workshops can be a good way to demonstrate commitment to quality teaching without having to uproot and interrupt a productive postdoc.  My postdoc institutions had regular pedagogical activities which helped me hone my thinking about teaching and engaging students.  Getting a colleague/friend at a SLAC to read over a teaching statement, as suggested by 5 is a great idea. 7) 1 here - Thank you so very much for the insight and sharing your experiences and knowledge. I am really grateful. 8) Teaching experience and certifications have no impact on your ability as a teacher. Being a good teacher is all about effort, understanding your audience, knowing your material, being clear about how students will be evaluated and the material on each evaluation, and your ability to make adjustments in your approach when needed (i.e., self evaluation). Every intitution I have been at, the people who pitch themselves as pedagogs are the worst teachers. Of course, this won't help you get a job at a university where people think experience and certifications are important, but it's the truth. This is why I throw teaching statements in the trash when serving on search committees. Anybody can be a good teacher, and there's no right way to be a good teacher. In contrast, andybody can be a bad teacher, no matter how much experience they have and how much they know about teaching philosophy. By the way, I wrote something like that as my teaching statement once and ultimately received an interview. Either they thought my honesty was refreshing, or just threw all the statements in the trash, similar to what I would have done. Good luck! 9) #8 I agree with you completely. In my experience as a student there was little (if any) correlation between teacher quality and years of experience. Some of the very best teachers I ever had were brand new. It is frustrating that this seems to be a box that needs to be checked at most SLACs just to be competitive. 10) #8 again, it's no different than SLACs wanting to hire people that have liberal arts backgrounds. It's all about maintaining the myth that a better education is obtainable at a SLAC in comparison to non-SLACs. A SLAC wouldn't want to start hiring people who don't have a liberal arts background. That would be like admitting that a good education can be obtainable at some cheap state school. SLAC theory: the only good educators are those who were educated at SLACs, and the only good teachers are those with lots of experience in new pedagogical techniques. 11) <-- sounds a lot like the Ivy League theory! 12) 1 here - I couldn't agree more with 8, plus, have you ever actually read a teaching statement? Reading one out loud... its noise-shaped air. 12) I spent a lot of time on my teaching statement to make sure it reads out loud well. It should be reflective, biographical, personal. If you have to fluff it up with pedagogical jargon then you're doing it wrong - just like the research statement shouldn't be too jargon-y. I agree with the above statements, you don't have to show you know all the technical stuff. You just have to show that you understand the learning process, have demonstrated some results, and you have the ability to do it as faculty somewhere. I actually like my teaching statement. Then again, I'm still a postdoc. 13) I have read hundreds of teaching statements over the years and they are critical to the decision-making process at my instution.  It is pretty easy to separate those who throw around buzzwords but have little insight into the teaching process from those who write reflective and throughtful statements.  Likewise, it is easy to identify those who ignore application instructions and include a teaching statement as an afterthought.",NA,"Master level Universities I was longlisted for a TT position at a master level Uni.  Instead of skype interviews they sent us a questionaire with a few questions.  One of these questions is about differences between teaching in research intense UNIs vs teaching in master level UNIs.  Is there anyone here who is a faculty in a Master level Uni that would like to share their experience here? Thanks!! 2) I was at a Master's level Uni.  Think high teaching loads, no money for research, unreal expectations, no culture for research, no infrastructures for research.  The winning strategies I observed was when you could use classroom data to produce publications (think HHMI Viral Discovery Project or plant surveys at field stations or something you could do on campus) or SoTL studies. We did have Master's level students TA classes (i.e. Intro Bio, Intro Ecol) and they required a lot of handholding to ensure they were teaching adequately.  So we had 2 hour prep meetings from 3-5 on Friday afternoons.  UGH.  But if the admin are in support and you like teaching, it can be a good gig. 3) OP here. Thanks! Yeah, teaching load very high (3 courses per semester), but publications required for tenure... 4) MS level universities are highly variable. Some are great, some are trash. In terms of teaching, the honest thing to say would be, ""there is no difference in teaching besides having to prep more courses."" But of course, go ahead and make them feel better and talk about flipped classrooms and all sorts of other hot button teaching techniques. They will love it. Then, if you get the job, do whatever you want, b/c no one will really care. 5) Love 4's response here. x3 6) To survive at a MS level institution, it helps to be able to filter out the propaganda sent out by micromanaging administrators and general incompetence 7) #6 Could you elaborate a bit more? X2 8) Read between the lines on the ""official stance"": a lot of MS institutions talk like they do research at an R1-level and teach like a SLAC - in reality they do neither. Need to be able to figure out where you can cut corners, for lack of a better term, to survive. Find your niche - do you do all-star grants/research, all-star teaching, or an acceptable mix (most profs) 9) #4 again...I agree with #8 entirely. Out of all the places I have worked, MS level regional schools have absolutely no direction. The standards for teaching and research are complete garbage. So, it's kind of a design your own job. If you want to focus all of your attention on research, you can (just don't expect a lot of university support or facilities). If you want to focus all of your attention on teaching, you can (again, just don't expect a lot of university support or facilities). The biggest frustration is that you have to come to grips with no one in the department being on the same page. There will be people who do absolutely no research, and there will be people who go into classrooms and talk about themselves for 15 minutes and then leave. Worse, there will also be people who do absolutely no research and also put zero effort into teaching. Even worse, no matter how crappy a colleague is, they will get the exact same benefits of the job as the exempliary employees. If any of this bothers you, don't apply. On the plus side, there are lots of good colleagues at MS schools and some provide a lot more resources than others. Plus, even though I found the job completely stupid, it was the most stress-free job of my career. Walk through the door, publish a distribution note, get mediocre teaching evaluations...BOOM! Tenure. Sometimes I wonder why I left such a cake-walk...oh yeah, pay generally sucks and a lot of them are located in some of the worst cities in America. I will say, I loved the student-body of MS regional schools. If you really want to make a difference in a student's life, there is no place better to be. ",NA,"offers  I'm in the process of negotiating an offer from one university, but I just got an interview request from my dream job university. If I end up getting an offer from my dream job university, what should I do with the offer of the other university? Can you just ""withdraw"" from the offer you just accepted? What's the protocol/options? Thank you. 2) There are long (heated) threads about this on previous year's wikis that might be worth ching out. Some people think it should never be done, others will tell you that you will burn some bridges but if it is really the difference of a dream job that will make you happier in the long run it is worth it. For sure it will make some people mad. 3) Take the job you want, leave the one you don't. It happens all the time, don't buy in to the cult mentality that you're branded for life at X university if you get a job. x2 4) An agreement is different than a signed contract. Do what best for you. You might piss some people off but it's part of the game. McGlynn has a good write up on this: https://smallpondscience.com/2013/08/14/on-the-ethics-of-juggling-job-offers/ 5) Agree - sure feelings might be hurt, but until you sign an actual contract, you can explore and accept a different offer.  I had this situation when I was interviewing - I received an offer the morning I was starting another interview.  I tried to delay the first offer as long as possible to make sure I actually liked that one better.  Try to delay as long as possible if you can to help make the decision. 6) Do what is best for you and never look back, you werent born and didn't get your PhD to work for University X. Pursue your dreams and goals, and if it means disappointing some faculty in a Department elsewhere, so be it, they will get a new hire next year. Academics need to start thinking more like those in private industry - academia is business, and you should NEVER sacrafice your personal needs for somebody elses needs. Don't light yourself on fire to keep somebody else warm. X2 7) so after you sign a contract there's nothing you can do? how much time will they usually give you to sign a contract? 8) I have never heard of a binding contract in academics. That means there is no penalty for leaving after you sign. 9) Also, you can tell the uni that just invited you for an interview that you have another offer but that this is your first choice. Don't be pushy, but give them the information they need to make sure they land you, if you are their first choice x 2 10) I waited until after the interview at dream job to tell them that I had another offer. I told the offer school that I was waiting to hear from dream school, and told them I needed a certain amount of time to make my decision- they gave me a month, but it turned out not to be long enough.. If they really try to rush you, not a good sign. It took a couple of weeks going back and forth to negotiate start up, but eventually I just couldn't delay any longer. I took a gamble and turned it down before I had an offer from the fream school. It did work out, thank god, but the experience is stressful! 11) @10, whew, my heart skipped a beat reading your story. Glad it worked out. 12) Those contracts that you sign once you agree upon a job offer don't bind you to a university. They are just contracts detailing the terms of your employment. You don't show up, you don't get paid, you don't get start up, and everyone goes their separate ways. My dept has had two people back out of offers after contracts were signed. I have no recollection of their names and don't care one way or another. If someone holds a grudge toward you for backing out of a job, you wouldn't have wanted to work with them anyways. "
NA,"Ohio State (Mathematical Biology) has anyone heard anything from this place?  Deadline passed in mid-November, and not a peep since...

Can other women suggest what to wear? I don't want to wear a full pantsuit but I have a formal jacket. Suggestions? 2) I've always gotten the advice that your outfits should be professional but forgetable-- so avoiding too-bright colors or patterns. Dress pants over skirts/dresses. Blouse with blazer. Better slightly overdressed than underdressed (& congrats!) 3) I went with knee-length dark skirts or dresses with boots and blazers. Haircut was a little non-conservative. Success. Have fun and good luck! 4) I wore a conservative dark blue dress, knee length and 3/4 sleeve, with tights matching my skin tone and black boots. My hair is somewhat non-conservative but I styled it as conservatively as possible. I got an offer. 5) I think last year's wiki had a discussion on this topic, which seemed to garner a lot of responses (""The what to wear dilemma"" under general discussion) 5) Remember that you're going to have to iron it is the material isn't such that wrinkles fall out of you hang it in the closet the night before. This has lead me to abandon dress pants in favor of dresses. Blouses remind me too much of school uniforms. If I'm going somewhere with an informal culture I adjust accordingly. 6) I think it all comes down to personal style, but the general advice that I've gotten is that you should stand out as being somewhat more formally dressed than the average faculty member. That way, when you walk down the hall, people will be able to identify you as the candidate.7) Another point to realize is that this will be different for different institutions. For example, SLAC tends to be more formal than R1; East coast tends to be more formal than West coast, etc. 8) I also have a full pantsuit, but never wear the jacket to interviews. 9) Curious to hear what people think is appropriate dress for men. Tie? Blazer? If no blazer, is a cardigan / sweater a good outer layer (since some interviews are in really cold places)? 10) Female here - I recently went on an on-campus interview, and brought two options for tops (both for wearing with nice dress slacks). a) A well-pressed collared button-up with a very tame pattern and a sweater-blazer on top, and b) a thin, nice sweater. Upon arrival, I decided that option a would be too formal for the institution (east coast), so decided on option b. On a previous East Coast interview, I wore the more-formal outfit on day 1 and the less formal on day 2. I DO think there is the pitfall of over dressing, especially for ecology jobs. 11) Do keep in mind that you'll be meeting with deans and other administrators who might have different expectations about appropriate attire. Speaking from experience... 12) I wore a full pantsuit for all my interviews. I bought it at the thrift store for $25, but I sew so I fitted it myself. 13) I love that, #12. Nice. (x2) 14) Agree with 10 (and also female). I used a similar strategy at interviews for wildlife positions in mtn time, and felt pretty good about those choices (but also spent some time time playing up field experience to compensate for fears of overdressing). 15) Was told over and over again to wear a suit, so bought a nice black sheath dress and matching suit jacket for campus interview last year. With the exception of my 15 minutes meeting with a couple of deans (blessedly they were in suit and tie) I felt uncomfortably overdressed for envi sci job at a western regional university. Should have gone with my gut and paired dress slacks/trousers with a blouse and cardigan. I hate that look because I feel like I look like a 25-year old 5th grade teacher, but it's probably the best balance between formal enough for deens and casual enough so the faculty don't think you are a bad cultural fit... (this is where I just want to be a man -- dress pants, button down, tie, jacket for formal locations; loose the tie and jacket and put a sweater over the button down (or don't) for informal locations... SO EASY!) 16) if you're the interviewee, it is JUST FINE to be the fanciest dressed in the room.  They're the slobs, not you. Even if you are a slob normally.  Also: I remember the interviewee that wore sandals. They didn't get the job (for reasons having nothing to do with sandals). \",NA,"Asking what your spouse does? I’m new to the job market and am not sure what to expect, but what should I do if I get an interview and someone asks, say in a one-on-one, what my spouse does? I have heard rumors that these kinds of questions are illegal. I get that it would be illegal to use information about our family life, like the possibility of a forthcoming pregnancy, as a basis for decisions about employment. But this seems like a different issue from simply asking someone what their spouse does in a ‘getting-to-know-you’ sense, which I suspect is not technically illegal. Would appreciate any factual input, including relevant links, anyone could offer. 2) not technically illegal (illegal is USING the info as basis for decision), but most HR departments will strongly advise not to ask this sort of question, because asking implies using. But, not everyone will get the memo, and it may come up. Asking about kids especially. (""professors with kids tend to buy in neighborhood X because the schools there are better"").  Think of ways to politely deflect questions like this. Answer like a politician, don't answer the question asked, pivot to a question you do want to answer. Assume the best-- assume person asking is doing so out of geninue interest in getting to know you.  3) no one has ever asked me that, don't worry about it. 4) I was asked this on an interview this spring (my wife is also in a TT position), and I hadn't prepped an answer because I didn't expect such a direct question from the committee member. I've been asked if I had kids on nearly every faculty interview I've been on; it usually comes from someone who is not on the committee, but in the presence of committee members.  5) to #3, seriously no-one ever asked you this? Curious if you're a man or woman?  I'm a woman. I was asked this on EVERY.SINGLE.INTERVIEW.  For what its worth, for two of the interviews I was visibly pregnant. For the others, I was not. I do wear a wedding ring. I answered openly and honestly, figuruing if it was a department I wanted to be at, then I'd like them to support my life choices.  Got three offers. 6) @5, I agree with you it is probably asked more of women, but age is also probably important. I'd imagine men and women in their late 30s get asked these questions more than men and women in their late 20s, for example.   7) I got asked on every single interview.  Once I said ""I thought we  weren't supposed to ask questions like that on interviews.""  The table went dead silent for several minutes.  Have an answer ready.  Sometimes people were asking with the intent of helping with a spousal hire, but even then someone else could use it against you. 8) I've been asked some variant of this question on every interview (I'm a man). I've tried to pivot but find it really awkward. In retrospect I think 5's approach might be better. 9) I'm female and was never asked by faculty on any of my four interviews about spouse or kids. I brought up kids in one interview at dinner with the search chair who had kids the same age as mine; I got an offer for that job. I think it's probably best to be honest but not super specific if it comes up. (""My spouse is a biologist."" for example.) 10) Been on only one interview so far and was asked this over lunch with two faculty (I'm a woman).  Answered honestly (he's also in science) and got follow up questions about how we were figuring out whose career would rank higher in our decision making from one of the faculty. I got pretty flustered and offered something along the lines of, ""we're just keeping all options open"" and the other shut him down and said we shouldn't talk about it. Haven't heard back yet, but did not love that moment in time. 11) @10, I agree it can be super awkward when this comes up! I wish someone had suggested to me to be ready for this question just like I was for all of the typical research and teaching questions! 12) Ive been asked about my spouse on all 5 interviews Ive been on (I'm a guy). Ive walked away from the experiences feeling like it hurt my chances when I told them my SO is also an academic. For one interview I straight up responded that I thought they aren't supposed to ask me that. Like #7 it got incredibly awkward and silence. My advice is to have a good non-answer/deflection tactic ready. For one interview, the search chair grilled me about my SO the entire 20min ride to the airport, and he made it clear he had no sympathy for my situation. 13) This question shows up on the wiki every year (and rightfully so!). And the answer people give here is always yes: people ask about your significant other even though they're not supposed to. Analogously, public school students in rural (especially Southern) areas of the country are led in sectarian prayers by their teachers and administrators, even though it is also illegal. There is, unfortunately, a gap between what is legal and what really happens out there in the world. Don't be surprised by this discrepancy (being surprised doesn't do any good to fix it), while at the same time strive to make the world a fairer place through your advocacy as a citizen and/or your leadership as a person in positions of authority., 14.) As a follow-up to this, should I take off my wedding ring for my interview (I'm a woman). I've been told that it hurts my chances of getting the job if the committee knows I'm married because I might want to leave to have kids. Thoughts? 15) I have served on a large number of searches in varying capacities and have seen this question asked, ableit rarely.  The candidate I was with when this question was asked (by a grad student) about their spouse repsonded, ""I would rather not discuss my family/personal situation"" or something to that effect.  As an interviewer, I tell candidates about my experiences as someone who is married with kids (tpically, ""I don't know your situation, but I have found this town/state/campus to be very family-friendly"") and I can say that the the presence of multiple faculty in my current department who are (more or less) successfully raising kids was a big factor in my decision to take the job I took.  To answer 14's question with my personal opinion, I did not remove my wedding ring during my interviews.  My thinking was that any department that is concerned about a semester or two of parental leave is not somewhere I want to be, both because that is A) a really crappy and paternalistic attitude, and B) not consistent with my values.  I know (first-hand) that there are faculty who resent parents (typically mothers) who take time ""off"" to have kids but I choose to believe this is a minority opinion.  In my current department, anyone who dared to voice such an opinion when discussing/ranking candidates would be told off in short order.  16.) I have only had one on-campus interview to date and was straight up asked if I had kids by the SC chair. I'm a male. I didn't anticipate this and was honest. Didn't get the job, no idea if that factored in or not. However, I was not pleased that the SC chair did not know this was a taboo question, found it unprofessional (also found it unprofessional that the SC chair was retiring and the hire was for their replacement, but that's a discussion for another time...)",NA,"International hires After a conversation with other US-based postdocs who hold foreign PhDs, we were wondering whether anyone actually gets hired these days without already having an H1B visa/green card? Most ""foreign"" hires that we were aware of appear to have US spouses, or US-PhDs.  2) at R1 this did not matter before. Not sure about now... 3) Foreign PhD here, usually R1s and R2s don't care. You can get hired on a J1 and they will apply for a H1B for you before you start x 2 @3 That use to be the case but with current government I'm curious if this is the same. I know outside of academia companies are less willing to sponsor people for H1B because it is really difficult to sponsor one. But in the end another one of these things that are out of your hands and gottaroll the dice. 5) I think for R1 will still be ok, because they have dedicated immigration attorneys at most schools. I needed the attorney to get H1B this year as postdoc. It is much much harder but a good school will have people to help you. Forget it for smaller schools. x 2 6) OP here. I feel like the climate has changed wrt foreign hires - much the same as #4. 7) I think US-PhDs have probably always made up most of the foreign hires - I'm not sure that things have changed in terms of hiring faculty that require visas for larger institutions. However, things have changed in terms of making it more difficult to hire foreign post-docs at some smaller institutions. For example, we can no longer do the 24month STEM OPT extension at my institution. 8) Thanks for your thoughts #7. As a foreign PhD, I'm not even sure I have a chance at  this - but I'm still playing the game. 9) Jeremy Fox from Dynamic Ecology here. During the 2016-17 and 2017-18 job seasons, 37 out of 306 TT asst profs of ecology hired in the US whose PhD uni I was able to ID got their PhDs outside the US. So, 12% of US ecology hires had non-US PhDs (most commonly Canadian, second most-commonly UK). Most but not all of those non-US PhDs were hired at R1 or R2 unis. I don't know about any recent changes in US visa policies, so I have no idea if recent changes in visa policies make these data an outdated guide to the state of play in the US. I should also add that I don't know what fraction of those non-US PhD hires were already US citizens or green card holders. I suspect most of them weren't already US citizens or green card holders, but I don't know. 10) Thanks Jeremy. Always good to see some numbers. The visa data are ""hidden"", and even ancedotally it's hard to know what paperwork people do/don't have in place.   "
NA,Univ Alabama Has anyone heard from either Univ of Alabama (Wildlife Biology) or ASU (Organismal Biology)? ,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"religious schools What has been people's experience at religiously-affiliated schools? One place I'm looking at has a commitment to non-denominational christian faith (including taking a course on christianity). It otherwise seems great and has a reputation as progressive, but that concerns me. 2) I did my bachelor's at a religious school and do not feel like I got a different education than others at non-religious institutions. As such, I happily apply for positions at religious universities despite not being religious myself. My red flags are departments that don't offer evolution and applications that require a ""statement of faith"" or something similar. 3) A red flag for me is when a school actively fights against providing birth control to female students & staff. 4) *cough* Notre Dame 5) totally depends on how religious they are. I applied for an adjunct position and was sent an email shortly after applying regarding my references being able to speak to my faith if they were contacted. I was totally surprised at the request and it wouldn't be something I would ask of my references, as I wouldn't talk about faith in a lab anyway, we're doing science. Long story short, after asking if this was critical for the application (it was without the HR person saying it directly), I kindly retracted my application. Oh, forgot to mention, after applying I was perusing their student code of conduct, they didn't allow dancing on campus...what are we in the movie footloose! Some of these institutuions are more concerned with religion than education. 6) Does this include schools that treat sports like they're a religion too? ;-) 7) The kids just want to dance! ",NA,"Negotiate if salary higher than expected? Any thoughts on negotiating salary if it's a good bit higher than expected? I was given a very reasonable number that I'm already happy with. Should I still ask for more as that's pretty much what's expected? 1) I would ask for a bit more, if anything as leverage for other items. If they say no for the salary you may be in a better position to get more for other things, like start-up, grad support, etc. And congrats, btw! 2) Yes, #1 is right. 3) OP here...  have offers ever been recinded because someone asked for a bit more? Just so scared after searching for so long that I just want to take the first thing! 4) https://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2017/03/01/tips-for-negotiating-salary-and-startup-for-newly-hired-tenure-track-faculty/ 5) Well, not to make you paranoid, yes offers do every now and then get recinded, but usually for negotiating in bad faith or being totally unreasonable. From the tone of your query you don't seem like either. Some places (such as the UC system) has limited ability to negotiate on salary, since they're locked into 'steps'.  But all that said-- yes do negotiate on salary if you can. A number that looks really big through postdoc eyes suddenly doesn't feel so big once you know what others are making at the same place/level/status, etc. 6) Ask for 10% higher. If you are scared, ask for 5-7%",NA,"Suggesting courses of interest When prompted to suggest courses you'd be interested to offer, should one suggest totally novel offerings? existing offerings? some blend? 2) Mix is good. You can never know what a department wants (and it's tricky knowing what classes are already someone's ""baby""), but generally they'd like you to help carry the load of existing classes and maybe providing something that they don't already have. Having broad skills and being willing to do what's needed is the best bet x 2 3) Pro tip: list the actual course numbers along with the names, so they know you looked through the catalogue! 4) @3, is that expected even at R1? 5) when suggesting existing courses I always write ""as needed, or could cover X,Y,Z, during a sabbatical"" to make it clear that I'm not trying to step on anybody's toes. x2 6) I think its twofold - first, if the ad lists specific courses, or is hiring a specific topic (i.e. evolutionary biologist, marine ecologist) than you should probably indicate the ability and willingness to teach that course. Second, it is good to look at the catalog - it can help you think of other courses you could cover and come up with courses that are not offered but might benefit the department.  Importantly, that shows the committee you did your homework and is usually viewed as a positive."
NA,University of Arizona (Phenoclimatology) has anyone heard anything from this place?  Deadline passed in mid-November Someone I know applied for this and they requested letters sometime in the past 2 weeks.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"postings It's impossible to disentangle the number of searches posted on the wiki from wiki traffic/use, timing of searches, etc, but there were almost 50 more jobs posted on here by this time last year. Does anyone have any gut feelings about trends in job openings? 2) Yeah, here‘s a gut feeling - I chose to pursue a dying profession. x2 3) Definitely seems to me like there are less overall postings than last year (I think the wiki is generally a bit broader in what is posted here than last year and even so there are fewer total jobs). I have about the same number on my list to apply to though...so maybe it has more to do with what has been posted here? (x2) 4) Personally, the toxicity on this board has been keeping me away. I find most of my jobs through my own searches now, and there seem to be as many jobs this year as last year. 5) Agree that toxicity this year has been way higher than any of the last 3-4 years on here. Not sure how or why that happened this year. 6) The Trump Effect 7) I'm not disagreeing, but I haven't noticed a huge amount of toxicity this year compared with last - have I missed it? With the possible exception of the post below about using titles, and there several people (all very civil) jumped in to object. This is such a great resource, and I would hate to see people abandon it because of a few bad actors. x3 8) I had been wondering if Russian bots had infiltrated the wiki... Some weird things being said here and there, but let's try not to throw the baby out with the bathwater. If one considers this wiki toxic, there's a fair chance they'll hate life as a professor. 9) #4 here... thanks for proving my point, #8... I'm sure I'll totally hate life as a professor. 10) #7 here, and yeah, I agree that the final comment there from #8 is uncool. Seriously, the answer to people's concerns is not to tell them to grow a pair, man up, get a thicker skin, etc. People's concerns are legitimate - I, personally, find it comforting that people have been firing back at the lame comments. There are so many more good intentions than bad ones, so let's make sure those productive voices far outnumber the unproductive (intentional or not) x2 11) Could you point out some examples of the toxic discourse here (serious request)? I am not sure if I am ignorant to it because of some bias, or simply immune to it at this point, but I judge the discourse on this board as quite civil. x3 12) my gut feeling is that there are fewer jobs in academia, yes (continued low or reduced funding from states, increaing retirement age of current faculty, increased reliance on adjucts), but that given all the other uncertainties in the metric of ""jobs on the wiki"", it's probably close to last year. 13) #4 here - I should say that I was only giving my personal reasoning for not using the wiki as much last year - I'm sure it's not the same reasoning for everyone. Anyway, some of the really nasty stuff has been removed (although the ""disco tech"" comment is still there on the Fitchburg State position). But generally, I don't like the ""not eco-evo,"" ""internal candidates,"" and ""any updates?"" debates that are constantly ongoing on the jobs list, especially when they get nasty. I'm just here for the jobs and the extra insight that people can provide, and I don't want a debate to be raging in the comments. Last year, there were also a lot of comments putting down specific jobs and places. The ""not eco-evo"" people bother me personally, because despite being very eco-evo, I am a physiologist, and I interviewed for three physiology jobs (plus two other eco-evo jobs), but the ""not eco-evo"" comments every time a physiology job goes up makes me feel unwelcome. Anyway, that's just my take on the stuff that irks me. Nothing earth-shattering, but I have a feeling that cumulatively it will drive people away who don't need the extra negativity in their day. 14) Where else do you go to find job listings? Just curious if there are other sites that compile jobs, or if you end up doing a piecemeal search. (I guess this is maybe a broader question, but seems relevant to this thread.) 14) Thanks for pointing out some examples # 4, I can definitely see how those types of comments might drive someone away. 15) For job searching, I set up email alerts on HireEdJobs (they call them ""job agents"") and I have saved a biology search on https://chroniclevitae.com/ and http://jobs.sciencecareers.org/. That may sound like a lot, but it's pretty manageable. I check all three once in the morning to see the previous day's ads. I haven't missed an ad yet this way. 16) Thanks, #15",NA,"Jobs without cover letters Does anyone have insight(s) as to why some search committees don't ask for cover letters? 2) They don't know how to correctly check boxes on the HR website' 3) I would email the SC Chair and ask what they really want. I applied to a position that did not explicitly request a research or teaching statement but upon asking the SC, I was told that it 'would be appropriate' to include my research and teaching statement with my letter of interest 4) #3 I agree this is a good idea, but two thoughts: 1) some ads don't have contact details for SC, and 2) not receiving the same ""set"" of application materials from each candidate surely violates some HR rules i.t.o. fairness? If places are truly open to diverse candidates, surely the ""rules"" need to be set in stone - not open to those who have been trained the ""right"" way to play the game? Note: this is not aimed at becoming a venting post!  5) I agree with @2 and assume not asking for a cover letter specifically was an oversight or taken for granted. I then try to find some other way to submit it (optional attachment, as part of my CV pdf, etc). If the SC really didn't want it, they can toss out/ignore those 1-2 extra pages. 6) I had a phone interview last year for a position that didnt request a cover letter. If the SC requests future research, past research, teaching statement, diversity statment, and cv, they already have lots of information about your background. I acutally prefer this model, rather than searching for hot air that isn't too repetitive to the rest of my application. 7) If chair of SC is not listed, then email the query to the department chair (or call dept secretary to ask). Cover letter is NOT simply to repeat other parts of your application.  Write one even if not asked for.  Cover letter is your letter of rec you write for yourself. 8) Disagree with#7 to always write cover when not asked unless it's for job on usajobs.gov. If really concerned, ask email the SC chair. When the application asks for multiple documents, it's usually a strategic reason that cover is not requested. 9) Agree with #8 to always write a cover letter, but disagree about not writing one ofr usajobs.gov. I have been advised by federal employees to add a cover letter to both my CV and transcript that explains how I am a fit for the position and meet the course requirements. The USDA application page that you get taken to after uploading files on usajobs.gov also has a space for a cover letter. This may vary greatly by agency, though.10) #8 here. Wanted to clarify that I DO think cover should always be included for usajobs, even if not asked. 11) #9 here. Glad to hear #8 and I were given similar advice!",NA,"Including a diversity statement even when the ad doesn't ask for it Yay or nay? 2) I just squeeze a shorter version into my teaching statement. x6 3) Nay. It's fine to include it in your teaching statement, but to just add another item that wasn't asked for makes it seem like you didn't bother to read the ad or can't follow directions. x2 4) Add into your teaching statement for sure. 5) Wouldn't including it when not specifically asked demonstrate that it is important to you and your potential role at that university? 5) @4: search committee member here: no, it just shows you can't follow directions. Further, most US and Canadian search committees are obliged by law and university HR policies to evaluate all applicants on an equal footing. If they're doing their jobs well, they won't even look at additional unasked-for material from you, because that would be unfair to other applicants. As other commenters suggested, just say something about diversity, equity, and inclusion in your teaching statement if you want to. 6) #4 here - Thanks for clarifyng @5, I can see that perspective. Sorry for a naive follow-up, but why then have options for additional documents to be uploaded if they can't or shouldn't look at them? x2 7) At some schools, the HR application forms are generic and some positions can request materials for which there is no drop down in the menu - in this case you'd have to use the ""additional documents"" to upload."
NA,"SUNY Southampton I Just got a letter from them about last April's search - it was canceled - may be opened again this coming fall. I was wondering about that, thanks for the update.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Dr., Professor, etc. I'm curious how eco/evo people feel when students address them as ""Dr."", ""Professor"", or by their first name.  I truly hate being called ""Professor So-and-So"", and being called Dr. is almost as bad.  Also, do people in eco-evo tend to use ""Dr. xxx"" or ""xxx, Ph.D."" in their email signatures?  (I don't use either, and I find it strange when others do.) 2) As a young (under 30) female, I have all of my students refer to me as Dr. SoAndSo or Professor SoAndSo. It feels weird to go by that and pretentious to insist on it, but it's the most effective way to ensure that they don't treat me and talk to me as if I were their drinking buddy. I have Dr. FirstName LastName in my email signature, but delete that when emailing someone besides my undergrads. 3) I am female and also have Dr. xx at the end of my email and refer to myself as Dr. with students.  It seems to reduce the number of students who call me Mrs. xxx, but it still happens a lot. 4) Dr. keeps undergrads in line - in class it establishes authority and I find that to be helpful. I don't sign my email with either Dr. or PhD, but when I see other people that do, I don't think they are pretentious at all. It takes a lot to become a doctor!  5) #1 here.  I'm also curious why people think students need to be kept ""in line"".  I let students know from the beginning that I will be grading them (fairly) because I have to, but I try to be friendly, and I really don't care if students talk to me like I'm a drinking buddy.  Also, it takes at least as much work to be a successful farmer as it does to get a doctorate.  I really couldn't care less about being addressed as ""Dr."", but I guess that's just me.  6) Google can answer your first question, as for the question of why doctors are known as doctors has to do with a degree. Historically, degrees were conferred or awarded for achieving a certain level in a trade guild. Tradespeople travelled to new destinations for work and had to have some identification for their level of skill. Originally, these identifiers were handshakes or symbols only known to certain levels of crafstpeople (e.g. master carpenter, journeyman stonemason, or apprentice blacksmith). Later, these people would (and still do) carry cards identifying them at their level of craft in a trade. Academics adopted the same system of degrees, and achieving a degree earns a person all the rights and priveleges to be identified at that degree (if they don't 'feel strange about it'). Unfortunately, farming was never identified as a skilled trade (althought it takes a lot of work, knowledge and skill to be a sucessful farmer), and thus there was no guild, nor ever any master farmers. That is why people with doctorates are identified as doctors, because there was a historic necessity for identifying ones skill level. And, like many anachronistic norms in our society, it persists. 7) Is #1 a man? There are stats on women's credentials being dropped more often than men's. My boss called me ""Miss"" once. 8) Undergrads are sexist as all hell.  I make a point of referring to my female colleauges as Dr. so n so around them (=undergrads), and if I'm going to do that for women, I might as well do it for men as well.  I also address all messages to colleagues I haven't interacted with before to Dr. so-n-so, since it can never hurt to be slightly too formal but it can hurt to be slightly too unformal.  9) I'm with #7's guess 10) I'm not #1, but I'm a woman and I agree with #1.  I'm also apparently intimidating to my students at first so I don't mind if they are more informal with me because I enjoy having a collegial relationship. I also joke with them that if they are not respectful that they will be the only student in class who must now call me Dr. SoAndSo 11) #3 again, I have students that work with me in the lab/field call me by my first name.  But it bothers me when students call me Mrs (which doesn't just assume I don't have a phd, but also that I'm married) because I think that they are much less likely to call my male colleauges Mr.  It just bugs me. 11) A relevant poem, by Susan Harlan: No, you can’t call me/By my first name,/And yes,/I know that/A male professor/Told you that titles/Are silly/Because a certain genre/Of man/Is always dying/To performatively/Divest himself/Of his easily won/Authority. 12) Interesting to see #8 writes to colleagues as Dr. X for first interaction. Do others think that's a good idea? Now that I'm a Dr I usually just use first names when writing to colleagues, but I wonder if anyone minds / thinks it seems disrespectful. I'm alson on the west coast, where everything is a little more relaxed.  13) #1 here. I also think that it's interesting that people think that a PhD gives them ""authority"".  My background is computing science and the best computer scientists I know are not the ones who have PhDs.  I don't think a PhD is a necessary or a sufficient qualification to get ""respect"" or ""authority"".  I also think it's strange when people frame their PhDs and put them on the office wall, like my banker does with his BBA.  You're a prof... Everyone already knows you have a PhD, so why put it on the wall? 14) Carpe diem Mr. Keating. 15) @#11, I <3 that poem-- thanks for sharing! 16) @#12, I write all letters to professionals that are not in my friends group as ""Professor so and so."" If they respond with their first name, I will use their first name in all future exchanges. 17) I also prefer that students in class refer to me as Dr., but not the reason that I think that I am special, but much for the same reasons as the other posters here: I am a person of color and a women, and sometimes it helps people remember that you too can have the same creditials and be respected like your white and/or male counterparts. Like others, I have many stories of students thinking I am not the one teaching their class on the first day. 18) 12 here--sure, students in class is one thing, but would you expect colleagues to initially address you as prof / dr?  19) #1 here. Definitely I would find it bizarre for a colleague to address me in an email as ""Dr. So-and-So"", even if we hadn't been introduced before.  Just not done, in my experience. 20) @18, As so many others have said, on first contact, I always address a colleague as Dr. So-and-so. Whether you expect colleagues to call you Dr.? That's up to you. @19, I don't know what your experience is, but it seems to clash with that of many of the rest of us. Let's take this opportunity to recognize that gender, race, economic background, family background, LGBTQ status, etc, lead to vastly different experiences, and dismissing the experiences of others, or telling them that their hard-won title is pretentious, leads to division rather than understanding. I, personally, hope that we are all trying to boost each other as well as ourselves, and #1, this doesn't seem to be your goal based on your comments here. If it is, I hope that you'll re-examine how you frame your thoughts in this type of forum, because it's not coming across as friendly or useful or inclusive. 21)  I read what 17 wrote, and it is entirely sensible and clear. Why is there still a discussion?  22) @20 #1 here.  I have said absolutely nothing that is not ""inclusive"" nor denigrated anyone's experiences. 23) You said that everyone already knows the prof has a PhD. I guess you didn't read the posts where people explained that, actually, people often assume that they don't. 24) Look up Dr. W. E. B. DuBois, what he did, studied, who he was, and how he insisted that people call him Dr. Why do you thnk he did that? Here is a hint: it was 1895 in America. If you don’t think the prejudice of people (black, brown, women, LGBTQ, differently abled) still exists, I truly feel sorry for you. Some people have to fight their entire life to just have a glimmer of equal standing with others, and calling them pretentious for wanting that is ignorant. Finally, if you don’t understand why a degree gives someone authority, you should be fine with going to the doctors office and having the office manager provide your healthcare. Please. Listen to what these people are saying. Learn and try to do so from a place of understanding. 25) #17 here; I don't expect colleagues to address me as professor or dr. The original question focused on students, so I responded about students. ",NA,"letters of rec as asst prof I'm in a bad place and applying for other position out of a TT job (sorry--one of those people). Two of my references from my last job search feel either out of date/unfamiliar with my recent career, or have retired. Has anyone else been in this position and can offer advice? I have a few recent collaborators who would be wiling to write a good letter, but they have been quite recent additions to my professional life. Selecting references now feels less straightforward than as a postdoc... 2) Send them an updated CV and give them a rundown of what you've done recently. I'm in the same situation. Getting letters from a current colleague (who knows I'm leaving and is highly supportive), PhD advisor, another PhD committee member who was also a close collaborator and mentor for a lot of other things (who is retired now), and postdoc supervisor. They've all been super supportive. I would make sure you have letters from a more recent collaborator/colleague as well as from further back. Good luck! 3) Similar here.

NA,"U.  Wisconsin La Crosse They're asking for LoR'ss FOUR DAYS after the deadline?  (1) I got a phone interview at another school <4 days after their deadline and a campus interview invitation just hours after I hung up the phone.  I think SCs may be looking at apps as they arrive to get a jump on things since they know they're going to get a LOT more this year than in the past.  That's just my opinion, but other job searchers in my dept have been reporting similar speedy activity. (2) I just hope that they do everything as fast... (3) So if I didn't get asked to submit letters, I guess I'm out of the running :-( Although I didn't submit my application until Jan. 15th.

That way I am not disappointed, AND, I can claim that I am a clairvoyant, since, so far, I've been correct 100% of the time :-) (5) To #4- I think I'm going to adopt your strategy!! (5) I don't understand what is surprising about this.

I went on a full  jacket and formal pants with a blouse the first day and most of the people I met where wearing t-shirts and jeans, so the second day I wore my blouse and sweater, that made me feel more comfortable. 3) I was on an evo search committee once and someone had a clearly well loved outfit that was in complete disarray for most of the interview.

Do you think they have an advantage over outside candidates? 2) My personal experience: Been involved in 20 searches at 3 institutions. Four different searches featured one internal candidate. Zero internal candidates were hired. Three of the internal candidates were fairly long-term instructors in terms of career stage. One of the candidates was a short-term adjunct. Within a year, the adjunct accepted a much better position at a different university. The instructors are still instructors at the same universities. 3) See this post and the comment thread: https://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2017/09/23/hardly-any-ecology-faculty-positions-are-filled-by-internal-candidates-and-you-cant-reliably-identify-the-ones-that-will-be/ 4) I don't disagree with either 2 or 3, but I'll add that I know several hires that could be considered ""internal"" in multiple R1 departments. The dynamic ecology estimate of 2-4% is probably right for those moving directly from a non-TT (usually postdoc) to TT position in a department, but if you consider someone who was recently a postdoc and then was hired back into the department later as TT, that is more common in my own circles. I think as #2 alludes to, moving from an internal non-TT lecturer to TT in that dept. is fairly rare. 5) It can vary dramatically. I've seen it happen several times in searches within my department or for jobs I applied for. My sense is that it is much more common at liberal arts colleges, but I don't think it should ever prevent you from applying to something you want. 6) Jeremy Fox from Dynamic Ecology here. No, the estimate of the frequency with which ""internal"" candidates are hired does not increase appreciably if you count people who do a postdoc somewhere, leave, then get hired back into a TT position at that place as ""internal"" candidates. I'll go back and compile some data on this, but from having looked at over 400 cv's of ecologists hired into tenure-track positions in the past 3 years I can tell you it is very rare. Also, before anyone asks: I've checked where over 250 recent hires got their PhDs, and *none* got them in the dept. that hired them. Again, that does happen (I know of one example from several years ago, before I started systematically collecting data), but it's very, very rare. 4 again) @6, thanks for the additional info, I just mentioned it was more common in my own professional circle. I'll add that none would be considered ""ecology"" departments, but rather plant-related departments in Colleges of Ag/Natural Resources. That said, the three I know from the last 2 years could be the only 3 in the country! The perils of anecdotes and small samples...7) I agree that the end result of an internal hire is rare and that they do not have an advantage when it comes down to interviewing 3-5 people and, in fact, may be selected against. Based on personal observation, I do think that ""internal"" or ""in-network"" applicants do have an advantage in the advancement stage though, the search committee is simply ensuring the search doesn't fail &/or nurturing networks and contacts. Bottomline - if you're interested, apply, apply apply!  8) the stigma against internal candidates is very real x2 9) I often sympathize with internals wayyy more than externals. A lot of them are geographically restricted to an area so they took a crap instructor job just to have a job. In doing so, they often sacrifice their productivity and when a TT opens up at their university, they are often behind in recent productivity in comparison to external candidates. Furthermore, if they suddenly lose that geographic restriction, they run into the same issue when applying for external jobs. It's a tough situation for a lot of them, and on top of that they get villainized by external candidates. They are just people looking to be gainfully employed similar to everyone else. x210) As a recent unsuccessful internal candidate, thanks for your comment #9. Being intensely scrutinized by your colleagues for weeks-on-end is isolating and soul-crushing 11) It's too early in the year to start grumbling about this again ",NA,"interviews in Canada I'm an American going to my first job interview in Canada. Are there any cultural differences to be aware of as far as how the interview process works, or other things to be aware of? 2) Canadian prof here, who's from the US originally and interviewed many times in the US back when I was job hunting. Canadian interviews are similar to US ones. There's some variation in details among institutions, but the same is true in the US. Have a look at the international comparisons tab here if you haven't already.  3) When I interviewed in Canada they wanted a fluffier chalk talk.  Wax eloquent about the philosophy of mutations.  They wanted less detail about how you would get the work done and how the methods would hold up.  They were more likely to ask about things like organizing workshops, again I think because of differences in the funding landscape.  Some of that is related to the differences in funding bodies.  Ask your search chair for explicit guidance and be up front that you have been trained for NSF/NIH style grants but are adaptable.  Be aware that there are a lot more grad student fellowships, as opposed to rolling grad support into grants for the PI.  3) I did two Canadian interviews, no chalk talks, and no huge differences there. Def be aware of the differences between NSERC and NSF grants- an NSERC Discovery funds a whole research program, with a lot of focus on you as the PI, while an NSF grants funds a more specific project. Other bigger NSERC pots of money often require some collab with government or industry. Great tip I got was to bring a couple paragraph summary of my first NSERC discovery to share, shows you've thought about it. Also- Canadian unis (at least all the ones I'm aware of) have twelve month salaries! No summer salary funding needed. God Bless Canada. 4) What 3 said - NSERC funds research programs whereas NSF funds projects - so when they ask you about funding, talk about your program and not future projects. Google NSERC discovery and give it a quick read. 5) One other thing- be aware that it's easier to fund Canadian MS and PhD students, but hard to get enough money in ecology to routinely fund post docs! So be careful about saying you'll have a huge lab full of post docs unless you have some genius stratagy to fund it. "

Your research statement and publication record already tell me what you're working on and what you plan to work on, so listing rejected grants doesn't give me any additional information about that.

When an applicant lists grants they've applied for (but not received), that counts as strong evidence the candidate will seek funding.  Seeking funding is a requirement of the job.  So when applicants list it, it is a positive.  We do assume those that don't list funding probably will seek it, but when the applicant lists grants they have actually applied for, it is nicely concrete.  I mean, lots of people claim they'll apply for funds from everything from DARPA, NIH and HSFP simultaneously, but if you've actually listed grants you've applied for, it's an indication that you're not simply claiming it, that you're actually doing it.

(3) Eocsystem ecologist job offered (3/2010)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Tailoring job talks What are your thoughts on tailoring job talks? Lets say the position is Evolution/Ecology but the job ad clearly emphasizes the Evol. Bio aspect. Most of my research is more ecological, which is what I talk about in my ""standard"" job talk. Is it worth revamping my talk to discuss some of my less interesting/ lower profile evolutionary work because it seems more aligned with the ad/ SC is looking for? FWIW, the position is for a liberal arts college with a high teaching load;  I'll also be giving a teaching talk. 2) Just my two cents, but I would focus on giving the very best talk you can. If the link between eco and evo in your work isn't really obvious, perhaps include _something_ evolutionary in it. But I would not tell a story you find less interesting (and based on less impactful work) just because it's more ""evolution"" than your ""ecology"" talk. I think there's usually enough overlap between the two, but having something related to evolution will give your advocates fodder to use against the jerks who don't want you ""because your work isn't evolution enough"" (this is a lie of course, they just want somebody else). The ones who flat-out don't want you will not be persuaded by the focus of your talk, but I think you'll gain more advocates by giving a really kick-ass talk. And I'm not sure it matters that the position is teaching-centric -- giving a great, well-polished talk speaks to how good of an instructor you'll be in the classroom. Good luck! 3) be ready at the committee interview to justify why you're X, where X is the topic of the search. Agree with #2, give best talk you can. Use the other interactions to assure them you're a fit for the position. I wasn't a clear cut fit for the position I got, and I got it (in part) from my responses to direct questions about am I really an X.  4) Last year during a campus interview I was asked to give an ""intro to environmental science"" lecture and I would be guest lecturing in a biogeography class. I made my talk about water and tried to make it interesting for the biogeography students. A few faculty complimented me on this and I was offered the job.  5) I agree, the best talk you can, UNLESS the job is a ""skill-set"" job, as opposed to a general questions job.  For example, if the position is a quant or a pop gen position where the department might be looking to fill specific knoweldge gaps, I think it's crucial to demonstrate job-relevant skills (flavored with your area of interest). I just had to completely recast my job talk from the general questions I address to the methods I use to address them. It took forever, but I got a ton of positive feedback -- I think having a strong conceptual frame to pin the specific skill demonstrations on helped a lot, but for this particular position, I think they really wanted to see demonstration of skill.  6) I lost out on a job almost certainly because I didn't emphasize molecular work enough in my talk.  The committee liked me, the dept hated me.  I bet they still would have gone for the senior candidate, but claiming I wanted to do knock-outs and staining for whatever proteins would have given me a much better chance.   Don't try to pretend you are something you aren't, but don't skip over a topic if there is room for collaboration or growth. ",NA,"Diversity statements  If I say in my diversity statement that I am committed to diversity (eg my lab hires and mentees have predominately been from underrepresented groups in science) isn't that basically admitting that I descriminate on the basis of race, gender, identity, and veteran status? I just don't understand what these schools want in a diversity statement, an acknowledgement that I know there is imbalance and a struggle? An acknowledgement of my own priveledge? 1) I think it is very hard to write, but diversity isn't really diversity really. It meant you have to target major minority groups in STEM, e.g. women and minority races. It is very tough to write, and the identity of the writer is very important too. Take the UCSD example that they gave on their website. https://facultydiversity.ucsd.edu/_files/engineeringC2D_Redacted1.pdf . It is written by a female scientist. However, if a male scientist were to write the same statement, it would sound really strange to me. Imagine, as a male scientist, you say you want to hire only females, is that commitment to diversity or discrimination based on gender? I am hoping for some advice on how to write one from folks around here too. 2) diversity statements are very easy to write. You just have to aknowledge the diversity problems that academia has. You don't have to say that you will only hire female students, that is not a diversity statement. A diversity problem also includes the lack of first-generation college grads, people with disabilities, LGBT+, etc. In my diversity statements I write about what I have done to address some of these problems in my career, so far, including outreach events in which I've participated, to recruit and retain POC, first-generation college grads, women, etc. You can also talk about the plans that you have to address this problem, for example, if the university has a SACNAS chapter you can say that you will actively recruit people from that chapter, and things along those lines. And also, you have to be honest about this because lack of diversity is a problem, maybe not in your life personally, but in academia in general, and as a group we have to fix this. So whatever you promise to do, please do it. 3) OP - Thanks very much, that is quite helpful 4) in the UC system at least, these are statements of ""contributions to diversity"". The committee/department is not allowed to consider how the CANDIDATE is diverse, but the diversity statement is about what they DO to foster diversity in their lab, campus, etc. There are lots of ways to do this even if you yourself are a WASP male. Science outreach with marginalized or poorly-served communities counts. Honestly, many of the diversity statements I have read while on SC have been milquetoast. #2 is incorrect, a really good one is not easy to write, or at least, most applicants don't write a good one. A terrible diversity statement may be enough to get you disqualified, while a great one wouldn't make up for a lackluster application in other areas. We had an interviewee a couple years ago with a phenominal CV (amazing # of pubs) but his answers to questions about diversity were one of the things that doomed his candidacy. 4) yeah, #2 here, I was being ironic. and I've been in school where the opposite happens. Crappy diversity statement, stellar CV, usually white male, no one cares he's not committed to diversity. Good to know that you're at a university that values diversity and commitment to increasing it. 5) I mentioned this on another thread, but there is a ton of literature on problems in retaining underrepresented groups in STEM. Considering we are scientists, I would use the literature to construct a diversity statement. 6) I sense frustration on this topic, and not just from this post. I think it's partly attributable to the fact that, generally speaking, grad students and postdocs receive essentially zero training or guidance with regard to diversity. It seems like that wouldn't be too hard to change. 7) @6 this lack of training is true. I'm at a UC and we only recently began to make them mandatory a couple years ago, so it's a 'new' problem and what this document should look like has not fully worked its way into the field, especially in the heads of senior faculty (i.e., mentors). I find that the most compelling diversity statements are ones that are specific to the candidate. What training can do is to help someone see that, oh, that thing X that is a part of what I have done, counts as a contribution to diversity. The hard part is when there's a blank page in front of you and you can't think of anything to say. 8) I think diversity statements are a good idea, but how many of these folks actually followed through what they wrote when they got the job? 9) My guess is a lot actually attemp to follow through. At this juncture, I have not heard that contribution to diversity is a requirement for any university's tenure/promotion criterion. However, b/c diversity/inclusion is really important to NSF, I'm guessing a lot of junior faculty are making a really good attempt at actively recruiting underrepresented groups for experiential learning. Obviously, an ulterior motive exists for many of these faculty, but it's better than nothing.  10) Don't listen to the depression-inducing voices on here saying things like ""everything is easy, everything is great, everything is perfect."" That's the fake-Facebook-type-persona that makes everyone feel bad about themselves. Real life is messy and hard (but rewarding and happy if lived according to your values). I say this because I am working on my diversity statement and it is HARD! That's the truth. If you're struggling with writing it, you're not alone. If you're working hard at your diversity statement and putting a lot of effort into it, you're not doing anything wrong. The people on here generally saying ""everything is awesome and easy"" are just puffing themselves up to look bigger. That's not how we should go about supporting each other. 11) The person says above that they were being sarcastic 12) Yes, #10, I think it's clear from the rest of the statement that #2 was being sarcastic, and I think his/her take is beautiful. If I may, I think #2 meant to say that it should be ""easy"" *to see reasons* to write a diversity statement, because the reasons are right in front of our noses, and they are very serious. As others have echoed here, #2 insists that, ""whatever you promise to do, please do it"". I think we can all agree with that. Let's just stay positive, guys, we're all on the same boat here, and we need to bring more (kinds of) people aboard =) 13) They exist to give an overpaid administrator in the diversity office something to do. x6 14) That's a sad way of looking at it #14, and probably one of the reasons why we still have so many diversity issues in academia in 2018. Diversity statements shouldn't be just a way to please a bored bureacrat, they should be one of the ways in which we aim at advancing our fields. If candidates and search committees don't take them seriously, we won't be able to move forward and make science a more diverse field. Most departments will typically have at least one or two faculty who actually genuinely care about improving diversity and making STEM fields more accessible to underrepresented minorities. Find them, and have an honest chat about it. If you never thought about those issues, that's fine! It's never too late to inform yourself about it, recognize which issues exist and why they exist, and perhaps, with time, actually come up with a couple of ways to contribute to a solution. Echoing #10: let's bring more kinds of people onto our boat! 15) Don't blame 13 x2",NA,"Side trips on interview travel I'm wondering how / whether to go about planning a side trip when I'm traveling for an interview. I think this was discussed last year and the concensus was not to do it. In this case, I will be going thru the city where I want to spend a couple days on the layover on the way back from the interview. It would be kinda crazy not to spend extra time there, since I want to visit there anyway. I'm considering buying a separate ticket home from the layover city so the search committee won't know. But would it really be so bad to let them know? 2) I don't understand why doing this is seen as something bad. I live on the other side of the country, and if I'm interviewing close to where my family lives, what is the purpose of going back to where I live and then go back to where I was to visit family just because it's seen as ""bad"". Plus, what about our carbon footprint? This is just one more ridiculous thing that academia has decided to be deemed as ""bad"".  3) I did this for an interview, and was given an offer afterwards.  No eyebrows raised.  I just asked for 2 separate 1-way tickets so that I could spend a couple of days with family at the ""layover"" stop. OP) This is encouraging to hear! I think maybe I'll go for it then. Also, they're reimbursing me, so they may not even notice. 4) I have gone on sidetrips for just about every interview - its your life mate, gotta live it. 5) I'd ask the search chair how to arrange it. Universities usually have rules for adding personal travel to business trips. ""They might not even notice"" seems like a bad idea. OP) OK, thanks @5. @4, how did you handle your side trips? Did you check with the chair before making arrangements? 6) I've spent extra time in the area I was travelling to, in some cases with the explicit knowledge of the committee. On one occasion, I suggested that it would reduce their costs significantly, and on another I had to wait around for my passport to be returned with a new visa stamp. They'd actually asked if I was going to tack on a vacation anyway. In another case, I was making my own bookings and getting them reimbursed, so they didn't see the dates until after they'd made a decision. I just always make sure to check that it won't cost them extra money. 5) @6, yes the rule at our university is you need to price out the comparable ""strictly business"" ticket and reimbursement is limited to that amount. If your extra bit makes it cheaper, OK; if it makes it more expensive, you end up paying the difference. 6) 4 again, when the secretaries booked my travel, I had them book the nights in the hotel I needed for interview and the plane tickets. I just told them I was going to explore the area and visit people I know. In cases where I flew out from a different airport, I just told them what airport I wanted to leave from and they were like ""cool"". In cases where I booked the travel, I just did it all myself and submitted a reimbursement that included travel into and out of two different airports. I'm sure the business people at your uni have had to deal with much worse hahaha. It is so funny that this is a concern in academics. My partner had an interview in the private sector, they flew us both out in business class, actually booked a side adventure for us, and made sure we upgraded the rental car to a convertible. What a difference demand makes. 7) I've done it two ways- come into the city early to explore (even asking for an extra night of accom in instances where they try to book you on a flight that gets in at 10 at night- nope, bring me in a day early please!) OR ask them to book my ticket back to city X instead of city Y, and then pay the last leg to get home myself. That avoids any questions about buisness v personal travel. 8) I did this to see family in a region that normally doesn't get side trips.  I didn't get the job but they seemed to LOVE it. They'd lost candidates who did not want to live there.  +1 on all the recs above about ticket cost etc.  But I recommend the extra day if you have time for it and telling the committee.  9) Anecdotal, but I was told by a faculty member that their department made a point not to hire people who didn't spend extra time in the area before/after the interview. They were located in a particularly picturesque area, but the point was that they want to hire people who want to be there. 10) I agree with 9. They loved to hear that I drove in a couple of days early to explore the city, it made me seem serious about it. "
NA,"Fordham Any news? I realize if anyone on the wiki had an interview it would probably be posted but any news?

Bio position they posted last July (and filled), and still haven't heard from them.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"application deadlines [moved from UW Biology-Multiple positions posting under Faculty Jobs tab] I know this comes up nearly every year, but this seems to speak to a general confusion regarding deadline dates. Do you need to submit the day before a ""deadline,"" or the day of? This has always bugged me about a deadline date - I don't think I should have to guess when the application is due. As with every other deadline in the universe, I assume that a date given means that one should submit an application by the end of business on that date. What is the point of not being transparent? Different schools word this differently (""Application review will begin on XXX"" or ""Applications received by XXX will receive full consideration,"" etc) but is there a reason why this type of deadline is stated differently than, say, a grant application deadline? How do other people read these? 2) And to piggyback on this, what is the expected timeline for reference letters to be in, when they're requested upon submission? By the deadline? Within 2 weeks? 3) If every applicant is supposed to arrange for reference letters to be submitted as part of their application, the deadline for the letters is the same as the application deadline (or ""full consideration"" deadline, if the ad is written that way). Yes, a committee *might* make an exception and follow up to ask for late letters--or they might just go with what they've got. And re: whether the ""real"" deadline is the stated deadline or the day before, it's fine to go with the stated deadline. But if you're really worried about it how hard is it to get your application in a day in advance? You ordinarily have weeks or months between when the ad appears and the deadline, and your application materials and reference letters don't require all that much customization for one position vs. another. x3 4) So... yes, sometimes it is hard to get the application in a day in advance. Field schedules, current jobs, family commitments, late discovery of a great job announcement, and all sorts of other life events can conspire to make it, indeed, that hard. And I tend to spend several hours, at minimum, customizing each new application - in my experience, the applications I've spent more time tailoring to the schools get me further along in the selection process. All of which speaks to why it seems important for the deadline to be clear. This isn't a game for those of us applying. I would love to know from people who have served on committees - do you have a choice in setting the wording in the job ad about the deadline? Does HR write these, and if so, might input from faculty help make things clearer? I'm most confused by the ""Application review will begin on XXX"" wording, and much prefer the clearer wording ""Applications received by XXX will receive full consideration."" Also, because of the attitude that you should just do it early if you're actually interested in the job, it's not the best question to ask of the search chair, so clarity is very difficult to come by after the job announcement is out. 5) You're making the mistake of assuming that exact wording of the deadline is what matters, and that the exact wording of the deadline dictates the behavior of the search committee. Forget about the exact wording of the ad, just do the only thing you can do: the best you can to get all your materials in by the stated deadline, without worrying about the exact way that deadline is phrased. Also, you may want to reconsider whether you need to spend hours customizing each application to the individual position; see https://dynamic017/09/24/how-much-should-you-customize-your-faculty-job-application-for-each-position/ ecology.wordpress.com/26) Very interesting post, thank you for sharing it. I'd note, though, that even the small amount of customization suggested takes me several hours at least (looking through faculty webpages, course catalog, univrsity mission statement, potential nearby field sites, and then wordsmithing a few sentences each for the cover letter, research statement, and teaching statement - and then getting all the documents into the job-specific format). Maybe I'm just slow?  7) To #6: I do the same, and yes, it takes several hours. Honestly I don't know if it is worth the time/effort, but I keep doing it in the hope that eventually it will pay off. 8) Yep, usually takes me several hours to look at what people in the department do and pick out a few areas of mutual interest to tailor the corresponding paragraph in my cover letter. 9) #6 here - thanks for assuring me I'm not the only one :) Interestingly, I find that I'm less willing to put in the time (i.e., as #7 said, not sure it's worth it) to tailor my application later in the job season, so while I applied to most applicable jobs in Aug/Sept, I have stopped applying to anything that's not just perfect now. Probably just shooting myself in the foot, but it's harder to push on after a lot of rejections have already come through. 10) at #5 the issue is confusion about what the ""stated deadline"" IS in the case of ""review will begin on X date"" deadlines (with many of these X falling on weekends, I generally assume these are the same as ""applicants received by date Y will receive full consideration"" but I understand the confusion.",NA,"Diversity Statements If I say in my diversity statement that I am committed to diversity (eg my lab hires and mentees have predominately been from underrepresented groups in science) isn't that basically admitting that I descriminate on the basis of race, gender, identity, and veteran status? I just don't understand what these schools want in a diversity statement, an acknowledgement that I know there is imbalance and a struggle? An acknowledgement of my own priveledge? 1) I think it is very hard to write, but diversity isn't really diversity really. It meant you have to target major minority groups in STEM, e.g. women and minority races. It is very tough to write, and the identity of the writer is very important too. Take the UCSD example that they gave on their website. https://facultydiversity.ucsd.edu/_files/engineeringC2D_Redacted1.pdf . It is written by a female scientist. However, if a male scientist were to write the same statement, it would sound really strange to me. Imagine, as a male scientist, you say you want to hire only females, is that commitment to diversity or discrimination based on gender? I am hoping for some advice on how to write one from folks around here too. 2) diversity statements are very easy to write. You just have to aknowledge the diversity problems that academia has. You don't have to say that you will only hire female students, that is not a diversity statement. A diversity problem also includes the lack of first-generation college grads, people with disabilities, LGBT+, etc. In my diversity statements I write about what I have done to address some of these problems in my career, so far, including outreach events in which I've participated, to recruit and retain POC, first-generation college grads, women, etc. You can also talk about the plans that you have to address this problem, for example, if the university has a SACNAS chapter you can say that you will actively recruit people from that chapter, and things along those lines. And also, you have to be honest about this because lack of diversity is a problem, maybe not in your life personally, but in academia in general, and as a group we have to fix this. So whatever you promise to do, please do it. 3) OP - Thanks very much, that is quite helpful 4) in the UC system at least, these are statements of ""contributions to diversity"". The committee/department is not allowed to consider how the CANDIDATE is diverse, but the diversity statement is about what they DO to foster diversity in their lab, campus, etc. There are lots of ways to do this even if you yourself are a WASP male. Science outreach with marginalized or poorly-served communities counts. Honestly, many of the diversity statements I have read while on SC have been milquetoast. #2 is incorrect, a really good one is not easy to write, or at least, most applicants don't write a good one. A terrible diversity statement may be enough to get you disqualified, while a great one wouldn't make up for a lackluster application in other areas. We had an interviewee a couple years ago with a phenominal CV (amazing # of pubs) but his answers to questions about diversity were one of the things that doomed his candidacy. 4) yeah, #2 here, I was being ironic. and I've been in school where the opposite happens. Crappy diversity statement, stellar CV, usually white male, no one cares he's not committed to diversity. Good to know that you're at a university that values diversity and commitment to increasing it. 5) I mentioned this on another thread, but there is a ton of literature on problems in retaining underrepresented groups in STEM. Considering we are scientists, I would use the literature to construct a diversity statement. 6) I sense frustration on this topic, and not just from this post. I think it's partly attributable to the fact that, generally speaking, grad students and postdocs receive essentially zero training or guidance with regard to diversity. It seems like that wouldn't be too hard to change. 7) @6 this lack of training is true. I'm at a UC and we only recently began to make them mandatory a couple years ago, so it's a 'new' problem and what this document should look like has not fully worked its way into the field, especially in the heads of senior faculty (i.e., mentors). I find that the most compelling diversity statements are ones that are specific to the candidate. What training can do is to help someone see that, oh, that thing X that is a part of what I have done, counts as a contribution to diversity. The hard part is when there's a blank page in front of you and you can't think of anything to say. 8) I think diversity statements are a good idea, but how many of these folks actually followed through what they wrote when they got the job? 9) My guess is a lot actually attemp to follow through. At this juncture, I have not heard that contribution to diversity is a requirement for any university's tenure/promotion criterion. However, b/c diversity/inclusion is really important to NSF, I'm guessing a lot of junior faculty are making a really good attempt at actively recruiting underrepresented groups for experiential learning. Obviously, an ulterior motive exists for many of these faculty, but it's better than nothing.  10) Don't listen to the depression-inducing voices on here saying things like ""everything is easy, everything is great, everything is perfect."" That's the fake-Facebook-type-persona that makes everyone feel bad about themselves. Real life is messy and hard (but rewarding and happy if lived according to your values). I say this because I am working on my diversity statement and it is HARD! That's the truth. If you're struggling with writing it, you're not alone. If you're working hard at your diversity statement and putting a lot of effort into it, you're not doing anything wrong. The people on here generally saying ""everything is awesome and easy"" are just puffing themselves up to look bigger. That's not how we should go about supporting each other. 11) The person says above that they were being sarcastic 12) Yes, #10, I think it's clear from the rest of the statement that #2 was being sarcastic, and I think his/her take is beautiful. If I may, I think #2 meant to say that it should be ""easy"" *to see reasons* to write a diversity statement, because the reasons are right in front of our noses, and they are very serious. As others have echoed here, #2 insists that, ""whatever you promise to do, please do it"". I think we can all agree with that. Let's just stay positive, guys, we're all on the same boat here, and we need to bring more (kinds of) people aboard =) 13) They exist to give an overpaid administrator in the diversity office something to do. x6 14) That's a sad way of looking at it #14, and probably one of the reasons why we still have so many diversity issues in academia in 2018. Diversity statements shouldn't be just a way to please a bored bureacrat, they should be one of the ways in which we aim at advancing our fields. If candidates and search committees don't take them seriously, we won't be able to move forward and make science a more diverse field. Most departments will typically have at least one or two faculty who actually genuinely care about improving diversity and making STEM fields more accessible to underrepresented minorities. Find them, and have an honest chat about it. If you never thought about those issues, that's fine! It's never too late to inform yourself about it, recognize which issues exist and why they exist, and perhaps, with time, actually come up with a couple of ways to contribute to a solution. Echoing #10: let's bring more kinds of people onto our boat! 15) Don't blame 13 x2",NA,Timeline First Zoom interview took place more than 3 weeks ago.

NA,"Job offers and disclosure advice Original Date: 12/16/2009- How might one handle juggling job offers with looming interviews on the horizon?  for example, is it in the candidate's interest to let SCs know that other offers are on the table when arranging an interview?  Is it wrong/unethical to not disclose that (an)other offer(s) has/have been made when deciding when/where to interview?  That is to say, should the candidate offer up this information or only disclose if asked? I think if they ask, you should answer truthfully, and that will get around quickly.  But if they don't ask, you aren't under any obligation to tell them.  As long as you are interviewing in good faith and are seriously considering all positions, that's not unethical.  If you are more interested in the non-offered position, you could always say ""yes, I've been offered a position at X University, but I really think it would be better for me here"". (2) I wouldn't mention it unless there is a strategic advantage (e.g. they are taking their time making you an offer after interviewing) but I see no reason to offer it up otherwise. It's none of their business. (3) How about the other side?  How do you keep an offer in the air while trying to interview at other places?  Or waiting to hear back about your spouse's jobs?

Advertising contracts are usually based on a length of advertisement. Sometimes the ad goes out for a month and expires months before the due date, giving the impression that it was not advertised outside of the schools website if someone happened to miss the previous advertisement. Basically, it doesn't really mean much. 4) Advertising on ecolog/evoldir/here etc doesn't cost money. x2 5) No one at my institute even knows this ecolog job board exists. 6) Yes. Sometimes there is an internal or fixed candidate but the position is required to be advertised.  7) I agree with 3. I work at a SLAC and we simply don't have a lot of money to advertise our positions. So, we post on our website and all faculty are encouraged to share and email broadly.

Do you have any advice on how to manage morning sickness during your job talk, meetings, flights? how did it go for you?  2) Sorry to hear that you're having morning sickness! I was in my first trimester during one of my job interviews, but extreme tiredness was more of the problem. I didn't say anything about it during the interview, but looking back I kind of wish I did, at least to one person on the hiring committee, so maybe they would have understood why I was dead-on-my-feet by 8pm. Good luck! 3) I'm dead on my feet pounding tea all day by 8pm without being pregnant! The ""don't be rude"" beer at dinner nearly put me to sleep - I think most understand that interviews are a gauntlet. 4) Morning sickness is terrible. I didn't interview while in that stage of pregnancy, but did do fieldwork with an all-male crew. I suggest figuring out what you can eat without throwing up and being sure you can get your optimal breakfast on interview day. (Maybe also get up early to get the queasiest part of the day over with before meetings?) I'm also a big fan of ginger ale in a travel coffee mug. Carry a diversity of small snacks, both salty and sugary. Wear layers so overheating doesn't make it worse. Also, adrenaline will probably be your friend. Good luck! 1 here, thanks for your great advice, I am happy to hear I am not alone. 4) I also interviewed in T1, but thankfully didn't have terrible morning sickness.  My issue was more not being able to stomach any food after about 6pm and the exhaustion.  I found though, that the adrenaline that kicks in during the interviewing process helped carry me through, I carried a big bottle of water that I sipped all day, and just picked at my dinner, which I imagine I might have done anyway due to the exhaustion of interviewing all day.  Make sure to find time for bathroom breaks and wear comfy shoes!  Good luck!  5) I interviewed at current position with horrible morning sickness in first trimester. I was also flying transatlantic to the interview, absolutely exhausted, and had a bad cold on top. The upshot is - I got the job, so you can, too! I didn't say anything to anyone especially since I was only 7.5 weeks pregnant. I threw up in the bathrooms a few times in between meetings and had one bad night after eating too late. I ate sour hard candy and honey whole wheat prezels to keep the nausea down and managed to make it through my job talk, my teaching demo, and all my meetings without vomiting. I think it actually helped that I was clearly sick with a bad cold, so it helped ""cover"" for morning sickness a bit and was a good excuse for not drinking at dinner. You can do this. I'm not saying it will be easy, but you can do this. 6) OP Here, I made it! and I don't think it went bad at all. I did feel absolutely awful during a few meetings, particularly those at dinner and lunch time, but managed to keep it up. 7) Will you start your group before or after your maternity?",NA,"Should i put papers 'in review' on my CV/application? 1) Definitely. It gives the committee an idea of what you've got near the end of the pipeline, both in terms of number of papers and topics. It's extra important if you have only a few papers actually published, to better define your research trajectory. Personally, I find listing the journal name gauche until a paper is ""in press"", and the category ""in prep"" is too vague to be meaningful and seems a little desparate, although I know some people like it. 2)  I agree with 1 x 2 Anything in review should go on there (without a journal name) but I'd skip in prep. I say 'available upon request' as well but noone ever requested :)  3) Attach a draft, preprint, or some committee members will act like they don't exist.  4) If its under review or revision I see why not indicate that? 5) Is it strange to indicate the reviewed journal the manuscript is under? Either if its under review or revision? 1) @5 I think it's a little presumptuous to give the journal name until the paper is accepted. Also looks a little weird when the manuscript that was ""in review"" at Science comes out in Range Science 1.5 years later. Just my opinion; I accept that other opinions might exist on this point :) @To previous comment: Yes I see your point to say ""in review at CNS"" (I can basically hear the eye roll of people). But what if its journals in your society (i.e Evolution, Ecology, MBE, Genetics etc etc)? Does it also bring the eye roll? If not then where do we put the line.... or I guess the line is just don't do it... 6) MBE's rejection rate is somewhere around 75%, so unless you're already past the first round, it seems questionable. 7) Yeah, I wouldn't list the journal unless it's at the 'In revision' stage. Then it seems fair enough because there is concrete evidence that you have a legit shot. "

Do you think it is best to present a modest/low budget to make myself more appealing? 2) It all depends on the university in question. 3) This is such a great question and something I would love people to weigh in on. I have always felt awkward answering this question in interviews. On the one hand, it seems risky to ask for too much, since it could be many times more than a typical start-up package. And I don't want to sound like I can't do any research without X amount of dollars. But at the same time, not asking for enough can lead to not getting as much as you deserve, and can make it sound like your research isn't very exciting or cutting edge. I think this question is particularly challenging at small undergraduate universities, where start-up packages can be as low as 5 grand. 4) https://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2017/03/01/tips-for-negotiating-salary-and-startup-for-newly-hired-tenure-track-faculty/ 5) I was recently asked to do this and I included everything I would have asked for at the start of the negotiation process but also tried to make it clear with my language that not everything was absolutely essential because I'm guessing the dollar amount was higher than what they would typically end up offering.

Based on this, I don't think they were having us bid against each other on startup... and honestly if they were I don't think I would have wanted to work there!

I'm an agnostic and I've seen a few job postings at Catholic Universities that look interesting. Would my lack of religion be an issue for my chances of landing a position? 2) In my experience, no. The only difference is that you might have to write a statement about how you embody Catholic teachings in your application submission. The search committee will undoubtedly not care about that letter. 3) Generally for Catholic universities it won't matter much. Other places like BYU or Baylor it makes a big difference. One school called me to ask about my faith, and when I bluntly said I had none I never heard from them again.  4) I heard of a job getting pulled from a very academic-oriented religious school when they found out the woman's partner was a woman. It depends on the university. Look up their code of conduct if you can.  It often gives a feel for what the expectations are.   As always, apply first, ask questions later. 5) only if you want to be part of al legacy of hate, intolerance, and a full frontal attack on reason that probably slowed progress by centuries. Please read your history of western culture. 6) That last comment - 5 - was not necessary and inappropriate. Religious colleges/universities are legitimate places to apply to for jobs, and this was an appropriate question to ask about that process. My take is that it'll depend very much on the individual school... in my experience Jesuit Catholic traditions are quite open, other Christian sects may be less so (obv. lots of exceptions to that) x4 7) 6--obviously you don't know Western history very well and the struggle of reason vs religious intolerance from the 1st century through the Enlightment and even today. Part of the reason we are in the political turmoil we have today is due to religious ignorance. Yes, many school still have religious historical connections; that is different. However, for those that still see the teaching of science as a secular threat and are inherently superstitious, anti-environment, etc--they should not attract a thinking ecologist. 8) Commenter #5 & #7, tone it down, seriously. No one is denying religious intolerance/ignorance exists. But, first, theistic scientists exist (I, myself, am Christian), and we are working to change things (for example the American Scientific Afiliation and BioLogos). Second, your attitude at the moment is just as intolerant, and the fact that you doubled down in a 2nd comment is not encouraging.  To the OP: Basically an echo of what others have said. Jesuit traditions tend to be more open. Look through the current faculty (not necessarily in the biology department) to see if any openly ID as atheist or agnostic; if you find some, it may be worth sending them an email asking what their experience has been. 9) Thanks all! #5 and 7 here again---my contention is this: One only needs to see the current political climate in this country that is fueled by ignorance-much within the confines of religious fundamentalism--and its threat not only to modern science--but our very republic, without which we have nothing left. Lastly, if one wants to practice their religious belief they are entitled to. I just, however, do not believe that some blended science-theology in a university setting as conducive to the progess of science, and truth in general. I also feel that I do not have to defend against something for which there is no evidence for. That is simply my view after working in a school with dogmatic religious views that allows an administration and faculty members to deny scientific fact if it doesn't fit their theological viewpoint, or exposes their hypocracy and historical wrongdoing. 10) I’m an atheist at a Catholic university, and I got tenure. How much Catholic you see will depend on the school, but I rarely see it here. It certainly doesn’t influence my day-to-day job. I have great colleagues and students (most of which aren’t Catholic). If something for the application makes you uncomfortable, then don’t apply. If not, give it a try and see how the interview goes. I was apprehensive applying where I am, but the interview showed me it was a great place. As an aside, I’ve found numerous opportunities to have discussions about faith and reason, something I find interesting, that I probably wouldn’t get at a different kind of school. #5 again (10) you are probably in a far less dogmatic place than I am. Good for you. However, the Catholic Church is very uniform in its doctines -anti-gay; anti-conception (even in the threat of life to mother) etc. And of course it cannot escape its horrendous history and the widespread pedophillia scandal and subsequent cover-up. Thus, there is some connection to enabling a tradition by participating in it. At this point I am very uncomforatable with it. I am not saying that good meaning people are not present in the institution--I am just saying if you have membership in an institution then you have some ownership in helping to perpetuate it unless you are working to change it.12) 5, your ridiculous diatribes do nothing to help. Please keep in mind there's a sincere question being asked here, and there are several thoughtful responses that will help one of our peers decide where they want to apply, which is an important goal here. Catholic universities, as others have noted, are not uniform, and I honestly believe any job searcher here will find no roadblocks to their scholarly success at most Catholic universities. To the OP, I'd say apply to any that seem like a good fit for you in other aspects, and if you have a chance to interview, let that be a chance to get a sense for the institution. Good luck! #5 (#12) I am sorry you missed the entire point of my responses. The original question legitimized my response.

Are there typically presentations involved? 1) I haven't applied to many Federal jobs but I did apply to one with NOAA and received a phone interview. The phone interview was not what I was expecting. The job announcement listed 6 major KSA's that were expected. I fit 5 of those very well and have taught most of them in class. However, the job was completely focused on the one KSA I had minmal knowledge about. The majority of the questions were about the one KSA and my answers were terrible. I was prepared to answer basic questions about the KSA but they were asking very specific quections about it. For example, I could generally discribe the skill they were asking about but since I have never actively been involved in research or application of the topic, I could not give detailed descriptions of how to do it or examples of when I have applied it. It got to the point of me telling them I was not that familiar with the topic and if I knew the job was focused solely on the one KSA, I would have not applied. I was told that the job announcement was a general annoucement that they often use for a varaiety of jobs. I was later offered the job, but turned it down. My take-away is to be prepared for anything that is on the announcement and don't stretch the truth. They told my references that they were impressed with me being so up front about my experience and knoweldge and that typically get applicants that stretch the truth. Based on my level of knowledge on the other KSA's I could have learned the one they wanted but it was just not what I wanted to do. 3) Thanks! I'm a little worried about the dreaded KSA matches in the interview, but I'm glad to hear that being real about lack of experience with very specific techniques (that I can easily learn) won't doom me. 4) I think sometimes academics can be a bit too humble in answering the questions to get past the administrative review. If you are confident you could complete the required task on your own without additional training, by all means let your answer reflect that. Clearly this doesn't apply if you've actually never done the task before, and you shouldn't ever lie in your answers. But, simply not being the absolute best, most experienced expert in the world doesn't mean you aren't perfectly qualified to do a task. I should add that I'm not at all suggesting you ""stretch the truth;"" just be aware that the first round may be an admin simply scanning your resume and adding up points based on your answers. If you honestly think you are qualified and should be considered for an interview, answer appropriately. 5) Many of those jobs aren't competiive, which is an important thing to note. They are often going through a formality to hire someone they have in mind. Additionally, many of the people already in government positions will inflate their answers - in some agencies, for instance, not appearing to be an expert in every area they want will not get you through the first scan (which is not done by scientists). I wish you great luck, but the best advice I can give an aspiring scientist with the feds is to either already be working for them or to know them very well already. 6) Is this true even for jobs that require a PhD? I can't imagine the majority of those go to internal candidates, but maybe I'm wrong? 7) The entry level fed job for a PhD is GS-12. If the job is offered at that level and requires a PhD (or combo experience including PhD), I would guess it isn't some closet internal hire thing. If it's a GS13 or higher, then yes, it very well could be. If they really want to make it internal, it'll be open to competitive service only. (I am also #4 and a former federal employee, GS7-12). 8) My advice is not about the interview, but rather on getting past the HR triage. First, I agree with #4, unless you can plausibly answer 4 or 5 level of expertise on most questions (5=""I am a widely consulted expert in this"") your application will be ""not referred."" Second, don't use your academic cv. Use the jobs.gov template and copy+paste all the buzzwords from the announcement alongside your relevant training/experience/pubs. HR simply is not equipped to see how, for example, the 2 grants you received as PI translate into your ability to evaluate grants. You have to s-p-e-l-l i-t o-u-t. 9) With respect to 'having someone in mind,' the majority of job ads for GS12 + positions at USDA, USGS, NPS, and USFWS, are 'requirement postings,' where they already have someone they want to hire - and they will hire that person. Worked for US government for 5 years. YMMV",NA,"PUI to research institution I'm a few years into a job at a smaller public university, largely serving undergraduates. I have affiliate status at a research institution and am co-supervising grad students and serving on committees. I'm re-evaluating my choice to be at a smaller school and plan to apply to positions that better reward research, grant writing, and grad student supervision. Have others made a move similar to this? How feasible is it? 2) Would be nice to see some stats on this. My perception is that it is not super feasible. While you (and I) have been time constrained by teaching and service, new grad students and post-docs have been catching up or passing us by (the latter for me). I would assume that the longer that you stay at a PUI, the worse your chances get. My success in scoring phone and campus interviews has dropped dramatically with every passing year at a PUI, although my publication rate has remained similar (3+ average per year). I personally know of no one who has made the jump from a PUI to a R1. I know of one person who made the jump to a R2, and I've made campus interviews at a couple R2s. I know a handful of people that have gone from state, regional PUIs to pretty research intensive SLACs. I've seen a bunch of people move from small state, PUIs to more research intensive state, PUIs that put substantial resources into graduate education and have pretty reasonable teaching loads (functionally 2 and 2 with credit for research and taking on students). At only two years out, I think you have a good chance to move into something better than where you are at, but you won't know until you submit the applications. One other observation: the people I know that moved from lower level PUIs to more research intensive universities all had fairly substantial grants (>$200K). 3) Jeremy Fox from Dynamic Ecology here. The move #1 is contemplating is rare, but so are all moves from one TT position to another. If you want, you can look at the data and do a bit of googling to see where assistant profs who moved from one TT position to another were working before moving to their current positions, and what their cv's looked like: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZLu7r1eJT8d8vkEeuyojk0yHBcaNNzJieJmL_H6VOrY/edit#gid=1229783214. The other commenters have provided great advice on pulling this off. Good luck. 1 again) Thanks for both of these responses. The data are much appreciated, Jeremy. 4) If you don't have major money after being at a PUI for more than a couple of years there is a vanishingly small chance you will be able to move to an R1."
NA,"Univ. Michigan, computational evolutionary biology This question was regarding the interview candidates for this position, which are putatively posted on the department website, but I cannot find this stated.  Thanks! http://www.eeb.lsa.umich.edu/news/seminars.html. Seminars February 4-15 are probably the candidates. (2) Those speakers don't appear to be computational biologists. Do you have additional information? (3) The ad was really broad: ""molecular evolution, evolutionary genomics, evolutionary systems biology, population and quantitative genetics, phylogenetics and phylogeography, and evolutionary theory."" These people fit that bill. Plus, these seminar slots were listed as ""reserved for faculty candidate"" for a few weeks before names were filled in. (4) Makes sense, thanks.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Moving after tenure (moved from under ""job regrets"") Why is moving after tenure harder? There just aren't many positions advertised at assoc / full prof level? 2) Moving after tenure is harder because the department knows they don't have a decent bargaining chip. (Whereas they can easily bargain down the demands of a postdoc who's desperate for their first faculty job.) Also, you're going to waltz in to a position with complete job security on day 1?  What Department wants to make that offer (to anyone but a proven hotshot)? 3) On top of what #2 says, assoc/full profs just cost more money for the school. A lot of searches at the assistant prof level just aren't authorized to spend the additional money to make the search open rank. For the few searches that are advertised at open rank, you are competing with lots of other people who also have established track records. If you are moving between universities with graduate programs you also might want to get funding for your graduate students who will move with you, which costs even more money.  4) Ah, the golden handcuffs of tenure.  I agree with #2 and #3's thoughts.  Furthermore, assistant professors are hired based on their promise, extrapolating from their short record.  As you get older, what you see is what you get, so fewer people can move at that level.  Also, if you want to move to ""upgrade"" institutions, then your productivity to-date has probably been hampered by lack of resources and/or excess of teaching/service in your current position.  So it can be hard to dig yourself out.  5) Translation here: landing a job is as much about potential and skillset as it is being able to be manipulated/controlled/kept down to size  by your department",NA,"Asking for feedback from SC After ""crickets"" in response to several applications where I am PERFECT FIT, dammit! I am wondering if there's any hope of getting feedback from SC as to why I got triaged. I redesigned my app materials this season making them more in line with ""standard recommendations."" I have asked mentors for feedback, but all my people are 20+ years tenured so not necessarily au fait with the latest SC expectations. I feel like I'm wandering a dark plain, randomly racing in one direction then another with no idea if my goal is nearer. So in a perfect world I email SC to ask ""explain in detail why I was not even long listed"" and they generously respond with specifics. In real world, has anyone successfully asked for feedback when you were in the big loser pile? Or other suggestions about vetting my materials? I haz sad. 2) I have received good feedback in the past, but not until after the campus interview stage. I doubt you would get anything meaningful if you were trimmed out in the first cut besides, ""we wanted people that could do 'X', which we didn't mention on the ad, and you didn't note that you could do 'X'."" 3) https://scientistseessquirrel.wordpress.com/2017/09/06/asking-for-feedback-on-job-applications-attitudes-and-practices/ 4) I asked for feedback after not receiving an offer after the on-campus interview, but I made sure to frame my questions in terms of ""how can I improve my chances for the future"", so they didn't feel on the spot to talk about why they selected another candidate. 5) I agree that you will probably have trouble getting anything meaningful from them unless you were a finalist. I think what you did already (asking mentors) is most productive. So do you have anybody like that who has recieved a TT position more recently, or has at least sat on SCs in the last five years? 6) I don't think it is a good idea 7) Read the venting thread ""So, yesterday I did something I don't think anybody ever did"" - that's one reason SCs won't give you any feedback. 8) x2, but really wish that thread would die 9) even if you are a finalist, you're not guaranteed feedback. After 1 visit, the dept chair and I had a respectful conversation about strengths and weaknesses, 2nd institution never responded to question of feedback 10) Responding to # 7. Yes, that could be one reason SC won't respond, but more likely, they're just scared trying to hide their bias'. Sorry SCs! #InconvenientTruth. 11) Look for something tangible done at the campus interview stage. If they fill out an evaluation form at your talk, ask if you can have a copy of those to make improvements on your talk for your next interview. I have done that twice and was given the evaluations both times. I feel that something like that is easy b/c it doesn't really give you a reason one person was hired over the next. However, I did notice in some of the evaluations that I was compared to other interviewees, so it did give me a little idea of what some people found better about someone else in comparison to me. Also, I requested this from the administrative assistants that were running the show both times. I doubt that the AAs even asked the search committees if this was allowed. Also, I was also given a digital video copy of my talk by one of those AAs where I was videotaped b/c of absent search committee members. That was probably the most eye-opening help I ever received in terms of my talk performance. It was awful. 12) @11 what did you do different (or what are you planning on changing) after seeing your video? I'm curious. 14) My experience is that, unless your cv is obiouvsly not competitive (but that does not seem the case), the main reason for getting triaged is NOT having any form of connection in the Department. I only got interviews where I had connections. And same happened to my postdoc advisor. And to many of other postdocs in my Dept. 15) 11 again, my talk wasn't bad, but it just wasn't nearly as good of a presentation as I thought it was in my head. Wayyyy to fast through areas that I was trying to emphasize. When I got to areas I really wanted to emphasize, I increased my volume to emphasize, but also sped up a lot. I also didn't work the room very well (it looked like I was speaking to just the front couple of rows). I would definitely recommend filming yourself giving a deparmental talk before going on interviews. It's a lot like acting. To get really good at presenting, you have to watch yourself do it and make adjustments. It's hard to critique yourself when there's nothing to critique. 16) My experience is different with #14. I don't think having connection is essential, but may help some people at certain universities. To #1 I used to apply to one perfect-fit position, and I think the reason I didn't get an interview (while my lab mates or friends got) is because I am not a native speaker, although I have slightly better publication record than my friends. The problem is that although it might be discrimination, it is ""reasonable"" for search committee to think I may not be an effective teacher compared to some other candidates, they will never be able to tell me the truth (if that's the reason) because that may cause them trouble. A good way to get the answer might be asking your advisor to ask a colleague he or she knows in that department. 16)Re: the importance of ""connections, YMMV and I don't think anyone should try to generalize based on the small sample of own experiences or those they've heard about here. FWIW (basically nothing...), I've had 14 on-campus interviews for faculty positions in my life. At only 3 had I ever even met anyone in the hiring dept, and none of those 3 was the one that led to an offer. 17) I totally agree with #16. Connection never mattered for me. I didn't know a single person in those 5 schools that interviewed me on campus so far. 18) My experience in this regard: UK 7 applications, 4 on campus interviews in places where I did not know anyone. U.S. 60 applications, 2 interviews, and in both the U.S. places I had strong connections.
	",NA,"Dealing with the 'old guard' Just started in a new department. Grad student handbook states only that GA/TA's should *avoid* dating students (weakly defined). I sent out an email about changing it to 'should not date students.' Was met with resistance and a person saying how the provost said 'we can't control who falls in love.' I responded by pointing out how soft polices essentially condones the behavior and mindset that creates the all too common superior ‘unknowingly’ abusing subordinates. Was met by more resistance from old faculty talking about how they've seen students fall in love and create children, and those relationships/children would have been prevented if we put a policy in place preventing relationships (they clearly don’t care about the huge number of underreported cases). What’s the next step? Ask for a supplement to the policy where we directly talk about power dynamics? That would avoid trying for an official policy change and be harder to resist. Ugh. 2) Are we talking about undergraduates currently in the grad TA's course, or any undergrads? I agree that the first should be prohibited, but the second seems potentially fine. BTW, this seems more appropriate for General Discussion than Venting but your call. 3) OP here - Just moved here. 4) What is ""Ugh"" exactly? It's not a policy you can realistically enforce (challenging even when it's a prof + student) nor is it wrong for grad students to have relationships with undergrads. Adding a discussion of ethics related to power dynamics to a manual or already-mandatory class seems like a pretty reasonable approach. (x2) 5) Blatant ageism in the title. Perhaps the ""old guard"" realizes you can't tell adults who they can date when there is no conflict in their roles. 6) I'd say there are better ways to use your time and capital in your new department than arguing with your colleagues about this x4."
NA,"Can't we all just get along?! What's up with the unfriendly, mean-spirited, antagonizing, and sometimes offensive activity on this discussion?

I'm sure it is a reflection of the intense job stress we are all feeling, but it does seem misplaced here.

",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"letter writers I have been at my Post-doc position for about six months and do not use my post-doc advisor as a letter righter yet. I know they would not write a bad letter, but I don't think they have known me long enough to write a very thorough letter. Instead, I have been using my PhD advisor and colleagues. Does this raise red flags in SC? Should I disclose this in my cover letter or when letters are requested? Should I ask my post-doc advisor to write a letter knowing that it would be rather short? I do plan on asking my post-doc advisor for letters next year. Thanks in advance. 2) I've been on a few SC over the years and was the chair of one last year. I personally would not be bothered by that, especially since you've only been there for 6 months. But yes, next year I would ask them to produce letters. 3) I would definitely not explain this type of thing in the cover letter, not the type of stuff you write about in there 4) I had the same concern. One of my current letter writers and my new advisor, both of whom have been on search committees before, told me this would not be a red flag. 5) I disagree with #3, this is the sort of thing you could mention in 1-2 sentences at the end of the cover letter if you so choose. I agree with other commenters that it does not raise red flags if you have letters from your other major mentors, so I also agree you don't have to mention it.  5) I've been on two SC.  Don't put this in your cover letter.  The purpose of the cover letter is to avoid having your application immediately tossed. You're trying to sell yourself, not sound like you're making excuses for something.  If you have a list of references at the end of your CV, include your postdoc supervisor as one, but add a note saying that they are unable to give an informative reference because you've only been there six months.  If anyone has actually bothered to look at your references, then they are already considering you as a potential candidate and will be more willing to cut you a break than if you are just another one if the 50 applications in their pile.",NA,"Phone interview opening statement I've been asked to provide an ""opening statement"" for an upcoming phone interview, which will be followed by a series of prepared questions from the committee. If the whole interview is 20 minutes, about how long should my statement be, and what do you think are important notes to hit in this statement? 2) This is weird. Have been part of tens of these interviews, and never was asked for this. However, they asked me to ""introduce"" myself. Maybe that's what it all meant? In any case, you should be prepared to say (1) briefly about your background, 1-2 mins max, (2) why you chose to apply there, 30 secs, (3) why you're the best fit in the position they wanna fill, 1-2 mins max. 3) I'd just ask the search committee chair what they had in mind. 4) I actually think this is a great idea. It gives you a chance to actually prepare a little and get across the major points you want the SC to know. That also seems like a really short phone interview. Less than five minutes for this opening for sure in that case. I don't agree that you should ask the SC for more details. If they leave it vague, that's intentional, and leaves room for you to impress them. I think asking for more details just signals that you think it's a weird and annoying interview technique. 5) Thanks for all the comments!

NA,"estranged faculty Just curious, how many job seekers here are currently TT faculty? And, what are your reasons for searching elsewhere? Also, how do you go about your searching/applying: are you covert? open to your department? how do you deal with letters of rec? (1) I have been TT for several years I have been seriously looking since last spring due to budgetary writing on the wall.  The admin at this school is VERY vindictive and I keep my searches under my hat.  Unfortunately, the admin discovered I was searching and gave me a terminal contract!  I get letters from former faculty of my current institution, andothers.  (2) Ouch!  how do you explain the situation to interviewers without sounding like you're the problem? (3) I'm looking for geographic reasons. I first started in year 2 and only discussed it with one colleague in my department who was supportive. In my cover letters, I asked schools to keep it confidential for the time being, but if they wanted to speak with my chair, I'd like to be the one to tell him. Now, I'm in my 4th year and I felt I should ask my current chair for a letter of rec, which he generously provided.  (4) ans #4, I don't know.  But be sure you read the ""universities to fear"" thread b4 you accept a job anywhere!  (5) I'm looking because my spouse doesn't have a permanent job and will use an offer elsewhere as leverage - definitely keeping it on the down low from admin - still recently out of my PhD so still using my mentors as references.\ (6) Looking for a more desirable location to live that better suits my lifestyle (not a big fan of the midwest).  Have sent out some apps., and interviewed, but did not tell my dept. head (and felt a bit guilty about it, but if they knew I was looking around, I'd probably get cut off from resources).  Am still pretty recent out of my PhD and postdoc and have letters from them. @ #1.  How did the administration find out about your searching?",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"job regrets Last year, I learned about an unexpected loss of funding and shortly after received an offer at one of the few schools where I sent material (it was a half-hearted search, as I expected a couple more years of applications). I ended up taking the offer, and am having some regrets about the location and department. I know it looks bad to leave in the first few years of a position, but how soon is too soon? I also know it's not cool to be making these complaints to folks actively on the market, but it's worth noting that taking a job while in a tough position doesnt necessarily mean you'll be happy. Sometimes it pays to wait it out. 2) Thanks OP, you are not alone. I would not assume that it's universally viewed as a bad thing to go back on the market within a few years of starting a TT job if the schools to which you're applying are a clear step up, or even just more in line with what you want (I would make this clear in the cover letter, otherwise SCs will jump to conclusions). Folks know how the market is now, and I'd like to think that SCs can see when someone is trying to do what's best for their career and family. Spending time with my dean recently on a long car ride, he had to do some quick business over the phone regarding a TT hire in another department -- person wanted to defer the start date for a full year, and the dean was fine with this but said he'd appreciate if applications for other jobs didn't go out for at least the year of deferment. Hence, I would think that people who have been around and know how the game is played will not view this as a bad sign. But just my two cents. Interested to hear others' thoughts. 3) Looks bad to who? I mean of course the department isn't going to be thrilled about it, but you fulfilled your commitment by going there. It isn't like a case of breaking contract at the last minute, which does happen occasionally. I guess you mean the hiring departments looking unfavorably on your application, but I think #2 is right that you can explain clearly that you are looking for a place that is a better fit and only applying selectively. The worst they can do is not hire you, but at least you've got a job to fall back on even if it is less than ideal. 4) There's always a better job. Won't know if you don't look for it. Why academics feel obligated to sit around a sinking ship is beyond me. We should be more like business men/women...always keep the door open. 5) There are lots of good (or at least unavoidable) reasons that it is way easier to move from job to job in many business careers, but I agree that if it is a really bad situation you should be looking to get out right away. You never know what jobs will be posted from year to year and it gets a lot harder to move after tenure so you have a limited number of cycles to apply in. Plus the odds of getting any one job are so small in this market that you need to maximize your chances. There might be some hard feelings, but they'll get over it and if not it won't be your problem. 6) Now is your best chance to leave. Go for it. As long as you're professional, the broader community will not hold it against you. 7) I don't have direct experience with this, but have gotten advice to wait a couple of years so you don't look disingenuous. No matter what, pre-tenure is definitely easiest. 8) @7, I don't doubt people gave you this advice, but I think it is terrible advice for someone who really needs to get a bettter job given the market. 9) My husband landed what was supposed to be an ideal job and once he started he realized he was in the middle of a political pie fight. A job opened up nearby with no relocation needed and was a great match for his expertise. But he didn't apply because he didn't feel like he had given this one a good go (we were both sold on the dream of this job, really) and now after year 2, he's sick and tired and now we probably have to move to get a job elsewhere. Shoulda taken the chance when we had it - learn from our mistake. *sigh* 10) Good on 'ya #9 for trying to be a team player and contribute...it's a tough call. 11) My sense is that moving around is becoming more common, perhaps to the chagrin of more elder faculty. I personally think it is healthy for the scientist though as anecdotally people I know in these situations are more often pushing the envelope in what I find to be interesting ways. ",NA,"Salary discrepancies One thing I don't think gets enough attention is the discrepancy in salaries between R1s and SLACs/MS-level universities. Starting salaries at R1s can be 90K per year or higher, but at SLACs and many MS-level schools, the starting salaries can be 50K or even 40K per year. I find that very low salaries for tenure-track positions are much more common than is reflected in the ""Negotiations"" tab here, and I don't know why. I suspect it has to do with reporting bias, where only those with good offers are reporting their stats. Others may be too embarrassed. I just wanted to air this uncomfortable truth so that no one feels badly for getting an offer that is very low. Yes, I know you can negotiate somewhat. But a 40K per year offer is not going to go up *that* much, no matter what kind of a negotiating ninja you are. <Cue the unrepresentative response from someone who claims they negotiated from a 40k offer into 150K offer and they swim in their swimming pool of startup money>  2) In some R1 Departments, salaries are soft-funded: you have to pay a goof chunk of your salary with your grants (e.g. in My Dept my P.I. has to cover 70% of his salary). 3) From my limited experience, it seems that (many? some?) SLACs refuse to negotiate the starting salary, saying it's not negotiable. 4) I have heard the same as #3, that negotiations are much more rigid to non-existant at SLACs. This isn't really a surprise. SLACs tend to be private universities and funding is heavily tuition-driven (obviously there are excpetions). Furthermore, they know you are not going to be bringing in large amounts of money, and duties are primarily teaching. I think another thing that should be mentioned is that at SLACs, your potential ability to increase your salary is much less than at an R1 school. That said, I don't think 40k is a common starting salary. Maybe I'm wrong about that though? 5) There is a wide variety of quality and funding at SLACs, and some will use the cost of living argument. I have interviewed at the high end and the low end - the high end is comparable or better-paying than the R1 where I did my PhD, and the low end is... embarrassing. One school made a salary offer of $42k halfway through my onsite visit. They also required research output, but told me any negotiated startup funds would come at the cost of my salary. Surprisingly, 2 years on they still haven't filled the position...6) It's not surprising that big R1s in more expensive cities offer big salaries when they are supposedly competing for the best applicants. Simple economics. 7) So does this mean that any warm body can teach, but it takes someone special to get a grant? 8) @7 that's an odd interpretation of this discussion...x2 9) Nothing very simple about the economics of talented people seeking academic jobs. Quite the opposite, really. I posted my salary on last year's board - 45K, which is among the lower I've seen. But I'm right where I want to be, and it's pretty cheap. 10) That's for a TT? 11) If 10 is asking about 9, yes. 12) I've never heard of a TT/T faculty position at an R1 needing to fund 70% of their salary so I do not think that is common at all. (I'm T at an R1). Of course, faculty do increase their salary by funding so-called summer salary since most positions are officially 9-months, and faculty can also buy out part of their teaching time with research grants. But TT/T base salaries are covered with hard funding. 13) to #12, a lot of positions in R1 medical schools are soft money funded. 70% of their salaries come from grants. 14) And, to add to what #13 sayd, there are lots of evo folks in medical school depts (especially Dept of Genetics and Dept of Cell and Developmental Biology). 15) @13&14, are those positions TT? What happens if you don't come up with the funding (although I imagine it's relatively easy in med schools)?  16) #14 again. Yes, they are TT.  If you don't have funding you do not get tenure. If your are already tenured, you get only 30-40% of your salary until you get a new grant.  Some schools, have some sort of ""Departmental support"", that cover salary of tenured professors for 1-2 years if they don't have grants, but after this either you get the grant or your salary will be just that 30%.  In some other schools they make you teach a bit more, but definitely not enough to cover the missing part of the salary.  In other words: in Medical School Departments you need to have  at least a big grant active ALL THE TIME. 17) Isn't that a bit stressful? 18) #17, yes. That's why some folks moved from prestigious medical schools to lower ranked R1 Dept of Biological Sciences after their tenure, where their salary is at least guaranteed and they could negotiate (based on their previous position at the prestigious medical school) a higher fixed salary.",NA,"Who to ask when you're remote and cannot ask your supervisor for a LOR? (1) I am a nontraditional postdoc without a lab or advisor (I have developed and run my own program). I work relatively remotely, and despite my early career stage am the most senior researcher in my field at my field station.  I do not work closely with any faculty at the main campus (very far away and the field station and campus are very independent).  I have reason to suspect that asking faculty for letters at my institution may hurt my chances of staying here if I end up deciding to remain.  My question is, what to do about letters? PhD advisor and grad school collaborators are still good, but I worry about no new letters.  Those I do collaborate with at my institution are my juniors (i.e. Postdoc and below).  Would it be appropriate to ask them? 2) Recent research uni search committee member here. Hard to give good advice as yours is indeed an unusual situation. I'd say keep getting letters from your PhD advisor and grad school collaborators. If that's 3 letters, then you're good to go for most positions. Letters from collaborators who are only postdocs, and who are junior to you to boot, likely would not be very strong letters, and likely wouldn't carry much weight with a search committee. The alternative is to get a letter from a non-collaborator prof in your field who knows you and your work well. And if you don't know any prof in your field well enough to feel comfortable asking for a reference letter, well, make it a long-term goal to change that. Your unique circumstances have some advantages--you're demonstrating your independence by running your own program. But its sounds like you're kind of cut off from interaction with anyone else in your field except a few junior collaborators at your field station. You should start thinking about how to change that. Finally, why do you think that asking for letters from faculty at your institution might hurt your chances of staying there long term? That sounds a bit odd to me. Faculty know that postdocs need to seek faculty jobs elsewhere rather than sitting around hoping their current institutions hire them. I'd be surprised if any faculty at your current institution would infer you don't like it there just because you asked them for reference letters for a faculty position somewhere else.  (1) here again. Thanks for the advice. To answer your last question, my position is renewed soft money, and those in charge of renewing it are doing so with the hope I'll get a big anchor grant and stay.  I have some reason to believe that if I am seen as actively looking elsewhere the likelyhood of a renewal for next year will go away."
NA,"U Florida Theoretical/Quantitative ecology what's the scoop on this job?  the spreadsheet says interviews scheduled ""12/??/09"".  does someone have it on good authority that interviews were scheduled? Yes 2) Interviewees are listed on the department seminar web page. ",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Spousal Jobs Does anyone have a spouse outside of academia?  In talking with my spouse the number of potential jobs to apply for drops off precipitously because their job needs and living preferences.  I don't want to miss out on opportunities, but I also don't want to undercut my spouse' professional life either.  I'd love to hear how y'all work that out with your loved ones. 2) This is my life right now and it's really making me question whether I want to stay in academia. The conversations were more fun when talking about moving was abstract and it seemed like we could move anywhere we wanted, but now that I'm getting interviews for rando jobs in not-so-great places, I feel like we have a lot fewer options and I'm trying to get creative about finding jobs in our hometown. (x2) 3) Definitely is constraining the job locations I would consider... but probably ultimately in a good way, because spouses' career considerations will keep me out of tiny town schools in the middle of nowhere 4) (1) again, I'm glad I'm not the only one!  I've started to look into non-academic jobs and that seems to be a plausible alternative (I do water quality).  I feel anxious only have applied for 5 TT jobs this cycle (2 of which my spouse is nto a fan of), we'll see what happens I guess. 5? I'll echo all of these sentiments. It's hard! I'm lucky to have a ridiculously supportive spouse, but still potenitally moving far from friends and family all for ""a job"" is a tough thing to convince someone is worth it. 5) Not sure it is any easier having an academic spouse (in an entirely different field). Sure, they get the reason for the national search, but we could both end up in not-so-great places that aren't even the same....this part of academia sucks. 6) I choose spouse over job every time. Not a lot of hope in academia for me, but I've never felt better about a decision in my life. I'm content with my life in a way that nothing academic could hold a candle to. 7) I would suggest applying broadly to every plausible job. Some locations may not seem like a natural fit or dream city but sometimes once you get the offer, you re-evaluate the place with your spouse. Some universities do offer spousal hires in adminstration or support positions. Who knows, you might fine a home in an unlikely city. 8) Non-academic spouse here (yes we too stalk jobs for our spouses and incessantly check this board), I just have to say that supporting an academic spouse is this fine line between stopping at nothing to make their dreams happen and balancing the desire to throw in the towel (on the search, not your marriage) at any moment.  Number 6, you give me hope.  I have found jobs at the universities we have been at for post-docs and his doctorate.  We've always found a way to make it work - even after adding a little one.  I hope everyone finds a way to have it all.  Good luck! 9) I applied for, and was offered a job a few months ago in a location my non-academic spouse was unenthusiastic about. He didn't actually say ""no"" until I had an offer in hand, but finally did when a decision was needed. I'm still sad about the lost opportunity. 6) Best wishes to you, non-academic spouse. It's not easy doing what you do, and I hope you can find a good situation for both of you. Best wishes to you, too, 9 - it's completely okay to feel disappointed about those things. 10)The two body problem is hard, even if both bodies aren't in academia. I'm also a non-academic spouse, and we had to have a discussion after an on campus interview last year. Didn't end up getting the offer, but it would have been turned down because of the complete lack of job opportunity for me in that location. We've been in the same place for grad school, post doc, and now a VAP position, because I have a very well paid, stable job here, and it made the most sense for our family. That may be hurting the TT job search, but it's the decision we made, so we'll see how it goes. 11) I am a new TT with a non-academic partner. I had been on the market a few years, and we had made the decision to go where a good job would be. When the offer finally came in (across the country), we bit the bullet and did the move. I think it was the right move for us. We are at an R1 now, partner just got a job, our lives and careers are ahead of us. It was very hard to pull up stakes near family with kids, but we felt we had to live our lives, which meant going with the flow rather than against it. I love my new job...12) Yes--spouse outside of academia (in the IT field) so they are extremely flexible. I honestly thought going into science was going to be the more ""stable"" position but now I'm so thankful for their job and the stability and flexibility it brings. 13) On the job market for the first time with a spouse with a mostly-non-geographically-flexible job. Any tips about how to broach (and continue broaching) the subject of possibly moving somewhere non-super to a spouse with no understanding of the academic job market? I'm restricting myself somewhat but not completely in where I apply, and I'm anticipating it being really tough if I get an interview somewhere spouse is unenthusiastic about (if I get any interviews at all). (x2) 8 again) to 13, as a non-academic spouse what really helped me was sitting down to understand the circumstances under which we were working.  As our journey has progressed and we have gotten further and further from family with a masters, a doctorate, and then a post doc, I have realized that proximity to family has become important to me.  And I felt terrible for noticing that so late in the game, but happiness is important on both ends.  I am realisitic in that there are only so many jobs in our target area, but we literally rank every job that gets posted based on my likelihood of moving there.  He can apply to everything, but I always reserve the right for a no based on our established priorities.   So honesty and constant evaluation is what has helped.  Good luck, it ain't easy!  And hey, hopefully it becomes a non-issue!!!! 14) Agree with previous poster. Important for partners to understand the market and odds so that the best decisions can be made without regret. 15) Another non-academic spouse here (with a Master's that mostly allows me to be mobile). I've been a major part of the job search/organization (also stalking jobs like #8) to both make it easier on my partner and to have some say in where we might end up. He's getting really burnt out on the whole process and I hate my current job, so it's been difficult to see that end-of-tunnel light. He has an interview in a non TT job that's still mostly research based and also in a city that would have more job opportunities for me, but I think he really just wants to stay in academia. It's a hard balance to strike, especially when there aren't too many offers on the table yet. Anyway, it's nice to have an outlet to discuss with others going through the same issues--there aren't too many opportunities for that. 13 again) It's not always a black and white decision of spouse vs job. In many cases it's quite difficult to know whether my spouse will be able to get a job in a particular city. Also, I just came across this and now feel guilty for being another data point in favor of search committees doubting the movability of male spouses of female candidates: https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/10/27/hiring-junior-faculty-positions-study-finds-bias-against-female-candidates-who-have. But thanks for the discussion! 8 again to 15) I wish we could start a support group, you sound like my life twin right now.  Best of luck to you and your spouse.  16) So glad to have found this discussion. Thanks to all for sharing. I have a non-academic spouse, and we are using the same procedure as #8 in that he gets to automatically veto job postings based on location. I won't even apply to anything that gets a ""no."" Sometimes I cry at my desk when a great job gets posted in a location where I know he won't want to move, but I figure I would cry more if I moved by myself to said location at the expense of our relationship. Best of luck to everyone - I hope you all find a situation that works for you. 15 here to 8) You know, that's a great idea. We could get that started... 17) @2 I'm right there with you. It's tough to imagine leaving my home and partner (he has a good job and owns a home in his dream location, so he has stated he will not move) but it's also really hard to imagine throwing in the towel on what amounts to more than a decade of work to get on the TT. I'm applying but like @3 am really limiting my applications to places that are within a day's drive of our home. Part of me hopes I land a job since it's the dream (or at least what I *think* is the dream), but another part of me hopes I don't get the jobs and after a couple years on the market I can say ""well, I tried"" and move on with figuring out another path in our hometown. Unfortunately, the latter will be difficult because our hometown is smallish (~6k people) and very rural (next town >1 hour drive away)...  18) I've come to the realisiation that my non-academic spouse is not ""wrong"" for putting location first and refusing to move, but that at the same time, I am not wrong for putting career first and needing to move. It doesn't make him a bad husband and it doesn't make me a bad wife, but I have just accepted a job a four-hour flight away from home and I am actually super excited about it! I had serious doubts (I'm #9 and this is the dream job the I declined 6 months ago -- I changed my mind and they were still happy to have me as it hadn't been offered to anyone else in the interim). I'll spend summers and spring breaks with my husband, and for the rest of the time, there's Skype. We'll make it work. In the past 6 months I have spoken with so many colleagues who are in remote relationships for the long haul... I'm surprised how common it is, and most of them seem to make it work. 17) congrats on the job #18 and good luck with the LDR! I think you're right that a lot of couples do make it work, but it totally depends on the personalities and priorities of the individuals and the couples. I know two couples that have been doing more-or-less what you are planning to do for *years* and seem pretty content with the situation, even if it's not ideal. I've also known three couples where similar arrangements did not work and the choice had to be made between partner and career. A brutal choice for lots of people (not just academics) no doubt. ... But mostly I want to say that it's kind of incredible that your dream position was still available for you six months later!! What a score! 18) Thanks #17. I was indeed very lucky! They were looking for a very specific and fairly uncommon subfield, and they are in a location that appeals to me but that isn't everyone's cup of tea. So when both I and the runner-up declined the first time around, they decided to wait a few months before re-advertising. That worked out well for me! 19) So can we ask where you're headed?? (I'm particularly intrigued because I also find that I am drawn to locations that are often turn-offs for others) 20) A small city in the tropics. 🌴🍹 21) Ohh. Well maybe not so tough to get the spouse to come for visits then! 22) You'd be surprised. He grew up in a cool climate and hates warm weather -- that's the main reason he won't move there with me. 23) @22 Lol. I feel his pain. Temps >75 feel like the surface of the sun -- and I'm from the mountain west, so the humidity of the tropics??? Forget it! ",NA,"Thank you notes for phone interview Are this too much? I also want to add to what I said in the interview (just a sentence or two worth of info). Any thoughts? Is this overkill??? I was thinking of sending one to the SC chair and then saying that he/she can share the email with the rest of the committee but I can also send each of them a note. 2) I'm a complete novice to this (just had my first video interview this month), but my impression is that a thank you note is more of something that you send after an on-campus interview rather than a phone interview. It might not hurt to shoot a quick email to say thanks for your time and enjoyed talking with you all about the position yada yada but maybe not much more than that (I think they are pretty restricted with the types of interactions they can have with candidates anyhow, so you might get a terse generic  response).  3) Can't often go wrong with showing courtesy. Sending to everyone might be overkill, but to the chair won't hurt you and can help. I will say not doing it after an on campus interview is noticed. 4) I'd just send it to the chair, not everyone on the call 5)  I would send a short note to everyone on the phone interview. It won't hurt. x2 6) Didn't you thank them at the end of the phone interview for their time and the opportunity? Sending an email after that seems like overkill to me. I didn't send an email but still got an on-campus interview. 7) I also made sure I thanked for the opportunity at the end of phone call. Felt weird to follow up email afterwards. So I guess if you never thank them clearly at the end then email? 8) It shows earnestness.  Can't hurt, just keep it short. 9) OP here, the purpose of the note was mostly to add something I thought was important that I didn't mention in the interview but come to think about it, I am sure I said thanks but I may have not said ""thank you for the opportunity"" during the interview but that's because I was too dam excited about it! LOL Anyway, in the end I did sent out the email to the SC chair and I thanked him and everyone in the committee and then I added the one sentence and that's it! Maybe I will update y'all if I get an on-campus! 10) I send a brief thank you to the committee CC'd on the same email. Professional courtesy is free and easy, and people dont react negatively to them, whereas some people might have a negative impression if you dont. I'm not willing to take that risk, considering how inexpensive it is to send a simple courtesy email. 11) I didn't send thank yous at all last year, and had several on-campus invites, culminating in accepting a VAP and withdrawing from a couple searches. This year, I sent a thank you following the phone interview because the job is a perfect fit in a dream location. So...

The comments are forwarded to the Head of Department who decides whether these shall be sent to the selection board for assessment. Please note that none of the applicants have a formal entitlement for their comments to be submitted to the committee"". How is that usually handled? Can you comment on everything negative like in a rebuttal letter. Or do you address only major misunderstandings & misjudgments by the commitee? I appreciate any help! (2) I have no experience responding to the report, but suspect that unless there's a major misunderstanding it might not change much. It may just be a legal requirement.

 (1) to answer my own question, it doesn't seem as though jobs have dropped as much in the humanities, but the trends of using more adjuncts and TAs for teaching probably apply... (2) I definitely agree that the downward turn of academic jobs is not something recent. Some blame the weak academic job market of last year on the economic recession of 2008/2009, but it's been bad as far back as I can remember. And like the author of that article, I don't think it'll improve any time soon (if at all), even with all the talk of economic recovery now. My problem is that with specializations like ours (community ecology, etc.) I wouldn't even know what to do outside academe. It's not like there're tons of businesses waiting for us like they do for biochemists. (3) I work at a large state university where all adjuncts (across disciplines) have lost their positions due to budget cuts. As a result, I don't see the recent trend of using more adjuncts continuing; I just see more qualified and unemployed PhDs.    4) In response to comment 2 here's one possibility: http://www.usajobs.gov/",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"""Any updates?""

It helps to define when nothing is happening and I think it is useful, like a null set in math. I think it also helps to know that there are other people out there that are wondering and waiting for information, just like you. (x5) 4) So why should there not be an ""any updates"" for each job, each day? Isn't that a pretty good null set? 5) Also, having a few people respond and say they don't have any updates doesn't give meaningful information. Most likely there will be many people who don't get updates from each job. 6) Any updates? 7) Sorry, no, I don't have any updates. 8) I don't have an update either. 9) Nor do I. 10) I do have an update, but I am choosing not to share. <-- lol  11) I never share any updates.

A TT position I am applying for doesn't close until mid-January. Is there any benefit to apply now or is it okay to wait? If I wait until January I can add the new courses I will be teaching to my CV which will expand my current teaching experience. 2) There's no benefit to applying early. But if you'd rather apply now for whatever reason, you can put the new course on your cv now with a note like ""(upcoming in Jan. 2019)"".  3) I've usually heard that there is no benefit to applying early. A lot of times, applications are managed by the department administrator before sending them all together to the search committee. Especially if there is specific advantage to waiting like in your case, I would definitely wait. 4) There's not much benefit to earlier if you can improve your application by waiting, but now with online systems search committees do see the applications as they come in. They're no longer going through a department administrator. 5) Thanks for the responses. I anticipate two things happeining that would change my CV between now and January (new classes to teach and hopefully have a manuscript accepted, it's been in review for 4 weeks). I'll follow #2's reccomendation on the future classes since they will happen no matter what. 6) @4 yes we have the *ability* to see the applications as they come in... if we wanted to. But no sane SC member is going to make extra work for themselves by reading the applications early. At my R1, all the SC I've served on, after the application deadline passes, we then have a meeting in which we divvy up the applications and discuss how we will review them for the first pass (long list). Jumping the gun just makes for extra work. 7) And in my experience it is still not uncommon for applications to be emailed directly.

I think if you highlight your TAing and any teacher training work you've done, that helps. Also, can you get a guest lecture or two in before the app is due? Maybe for a class taught by a letter writer, who can speak to your teaching / desire to teach? 3) Jeremy Fox from Dynamic Ecology here. Here are data that speak to your question:   https://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2019/07/10/a-crude-statistical-summary-of-the-teaching-experience-of-recently-hired-n-american-tt-ecology-faculty/. As #2 notes, you can't get a job you don't apply for. Do your best to highlight the teaching experience and training you do have (e.g., explain how your outreach experience informs your teaching), don't oversell (e.g., no search committee is going to think a couple of guest lectures constitutes substantial teaching experience), and write a thoughtful teaching statement with concrete examples. But yes, the truth is that recent TT hires for the teaching-intensive positions in ecology almost invariably have served as instructors of record (or in rare cases as co-instructors, or some other substantial form of teaching experience going well beyond just TAing and/or guest lecturing.). Good luck. 4) thank you! This info is really helpful! 5) I've had interviews (but no job offers) at two Cal States in the last few years and have only TA and guest lecturing experience (no instructor of record). Not sure if that contributed to my ultimately not getting offers, but it didn't seem to be an issue for getting an interview. 6) I'm an example of someone that got a teaching heavy position (60% teaching) with only TA and guest lecture experience. I highlighted my participation in teaching workshops and certificate courses, to indicate that I really want to be a good instructor. I also put a lot of effort in preparing for the teaching part of the on-campus interview. I think I had 5 course syllabi prepared with assignments that demonstrated my teaching philosophy. Rather than doing a standard research seminar, I also ""taught"" them my research, if that makes sense. Good luck. It can be done! 7) Believe me they really don't care about teaching experience. I have tons of teaching exp (25 years). They want young minted PhDs. They know the teaching will develop in time. They will hire you (with no exp) over me 10 out of 10 times. I know.

I am also curious about whether I am expected to wear ""formal"" interview clothes. Thank you! 2) I wear a blouse (female), but not my ""interview"" pants or shoes. One tip re. clothing: don't wear narrow stripes! They create an appearance of movement on the screen. Make sure you do your research on the school and department, so can talk about your ""fit"" there and not just about your own research/teaching.  3) You can ask the search chair if they can share who will be on the call then make sure to look those people up and know their areas, etc.  I also followed much of the advice in this professor is in post: https://theprofessorisin.com/2011/10/31/thephoneorskypeinterview/.  And congrats! 4) Question that always comes: why did you apply? Answers that work: people in the dpt with similar interests i could talk to/collaborate with. I could attract good students in your department, etc.. Another question that I got at every single skype interview is what will my first project. At this point you want to tell them read my research statement you damn $%^&%, but really you have to repeat what is already in statement as short term goals. As crazy as it sounds I suspect many committees do not read research statement extensively for the people they skype interview. It is usually 10-15 people so you would think they would at least do the effort for those ones. Also, ask questions that make you sound interested. Teaching load is not as good as a question as asking about freedom in creating courses. It then shows more motivation and interest in the position. Always try to ask at least two questions. Only one question is not enough to signal actual interest in the position. 5) I set a timer for myself every time I started to answer a question so that I could really try to make sure I didn't drone on and on. I kept my answers to 2 mins apiece. 6) #4 you're not being totally fair-- you have your statement memorized, but the committee doesn't. They might confuse you with someone else if you don't remind them who you are. Your statement is a series of talking points, and the need to repeat your talking points is a standard practice in communication with an audience that doesn't already know you.  Also, you'd be surprised how often someone says one thing in their written materials, but you ask them the same question straight up and they don't give you the same answer (!!). Asking questions you already know the asnwer to is a way of revealing red flags. So, smile, answer the question the same way you have it in your research statement.  Finally, many committees are required to ask questions from a pre-determined ruberic (helps to avoid implicit bias) and thus have to ask you all the standard questions, even if they already know the answer from your application materials. 7) I reinforce what #5 says about keeping your answers short. Practice being able to describe your entire research program in two minutes. I once answered this question by starting with the very big picture and the interviewers had to cut me off before I even got to the specifics. Also, one question that threw me off was where they asked for 3 concepts I would teach; I started rambling on and I wasn't sure if I had said 2 or 3 or 4. So it could be good to think of your answers as lists in case they ask for a specific number of, say, research goals or teaching goals, etc.",NA,"job talk: future research directions How do you approach the ""future research directions"" part of your job talk: ""with this I am interested in continuing/expanding my research on..."" ? and how much time do you talk about it? 2) Depends if there's also a chalk talk or not. If so, then I spend less than 10 min on it. If not, then it'll be a bigger chunk of the talk. 3) I think ten minutes should be the maximum even without a chalk talk. 4) Agree with 3, I've never seen a job talk with >10 minutes of 'future directions' as a standalone section. Some talks have future directions more sprinkled in throughout and then the total might add up to 10 minutes. If there is a separate chalk talk I think the future directions can be very short.",NA,"CV order question Age-old question: publications first, or funding first? My pubs are very good and I listed them first in the past, but just got a big NSF grant as PI that would be transferrable. Should that go before pubs now? 2) I put grants first, but I can't imagine it making a difference. BTW, congrats on the $!  3) I once heard someone say that you will list items in the order that you value them.  Are your grants the best thing on your CV?  List them first.  Papers?  List those first.  It's not a set and fast rule, so long as the CV can be read from a distance.  Make your headings clear when peeking out from under a pile of papers on your desk. 4) Recent N. American search committee member here. Ordering of cv sections varies among applicants, and doesn't matter. Any non-weird ordering is fine (where ""non-weird"" includes both ""pubs first"" and ""grants first""). Frankly I bet even a weird ordering that nobody ever uses, like ""committee service first"", would probably be fine. If your application is at all competitive with the others in the applicant pool, everyone on the search committee will look at all the sections on your cv they care about, no matter what order those sections are in.   3) I never heard anyone say their committee service was the best thing on their CV.  ;) <- hence why that would be weird. 4) order them to match the job description.  Is it weighted toward research?  Grants and pubs first.  Weighted to teaching?  Teaching first.  Weighted to admin?  Admin and service first.  "

",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Salary desired?

I honestly just wrote NA and moved on because I felt so uncomfortable but it required that I put something. 2) If it's a public institution, I look up what other early stage TT faculty make and round it (I always look up men in case there are gender gaps). 3) This one is private 4) I noticed this on a recent private application and you could just leave it blank wihch is what I usually do 5) You could write ""To be discussed"", I don't think that's something set by the SC, that's a HR thing 6) I always write $999,999. This is just HR bullshit b/c HRs often don't have separate online applications for jobs accross campuses. I've had websites ask for expected hourly wage. Just ignore and move on. 7) If it was on the Marquette application, it didn't have an asterisk as being required. Their form appears to be super-generalized for all positions at the university 8) You could also look at the 'Negotiations' tab from last year. Folks often post their starting salaries there.",NA,"Horizontal hires putting pressure on the job market?\ I'm not sure if this is a long running trend, but I noticed that quite a few Assistant Prof level positions last year were taken by people who already had faculty positions and had been there for 1-3 years. I'm sure this trend must be very damaging for the market- presumably those people have already spent a chunk of their start up on non-recoverable expenses (meaning the uni is down resources for the next hire) and in many cases it's unlikley that a department would get permission to rehire directly- especially if the 'line' came from outside the department- and if they did it would likely take quite some time. My theory is that this practice of a quick starter job is hurting the market for everyone. Thoughts? 2) I think you are right about this trend, but it would be interesting to see some data to see if our assumptions are correct. I think there could be two things driving it: a) the more competitive market leads candidates to accept less than ideal positions at first, with the hope of moving later, and b) a higher percentage of faculty have a ""two-body"" problem than in the past, and so moving is often required to accomodate both careers. As for the point about university resources, maybe, but one only has to look at the proliferation of administrative hires and associated salaries to realize there is always money in the banana stand. 3) Jeremy Fox from Dynamic Ecology here. I've compiled systemic data on this. 10% of TT N. American faculty positions in ecology or an allied field that were listed on ecoevojobs.net in 2017-18 were filled by someone who was a TT AP at another institution at the time of hiring. So no, the ecology faculty job market is not becoming dominated by APs playing musical chairs. I hope these data are reassuring to folks who were worried about this. 4) Thanks, Jeremy Fox! I've actually been wondering if the opposite is true - if it's getting harder to make a horizontal move than previously. I know many senior ecologists who went through 1 or 2 universities prior to their current position. But it seems like many people, especially on last year's wiki, seemed to think this wasn't happening nearly as much any more. Anyone have any data/thoughts on that? 5) I know 3 that did it last year. All were pre tenure. Previous to last year, I knew of no one in my inner circle that made a successful jump, though many had tried. I don't know what to think anymore. 6) I think this happens more frequently with people are being hired into top programs, but I see just as many people jumping ship from those programs after tenure. 7) Jeremy Fox here again. You can't generalize about the small number of faculty who change institutions in any given year. Last year, the asst profs who moved from one TT ecology position to another included people moving from, and to, the full range of institutions, from bachelor's colleges to R1 universities. @4: Sorry, I don't keep track of hires above the asst prof level, so don't have data on post-tenure (i.e. associate and full prof) ecology faculty moving from one institution to another. I can tell you it is rare and always has been; in any given year only a very small minority of associate and full profs will change institutions, even if you restrict attention to associate and full profs at R1 universities. But I don't know *exactly* how rare, or if it's any more or less rare than it used to be decades ago. 8) Thanks to Jeremy for the data! I'm guessing there is no data on the average spread of applicants among ABDs, postdocs and TT/T profs? I have thoughts from the search committees I've served on, but I'm sure it differs across sub-fields... 9) Jeremy Fox here. I don't have data on applicants, but the large majority of new hires were postdocs at the time they were hired (too lazy to look up the exact fraction just now...). That's equally true at all types of institutions, from bachelor's colleges to R1 universities. So based on that fact, plus my own anecdotal experience serving on search committees, I'm sure the large majority of applicants to TT jobs at all types of institutions are postdocs. I haven't broken the data down by subfield (subfields are too fuzzily defined for that), but just offhand I haven't noticed any difference in fraction of new hires who were postdocs comparing between, say, ecology vs. fish & wildlife. 10) still doesn't answer whether there is more horizontal pressure because you have no historical data, so there could be more horizontal pressure. 8again) @ 9 (Jeremy) I'm sure you are right that most applicants are postdocs, I was more curious about the TT/T percentage and if it's changed over time 10) Original poster here. Thanks for the specifics Jeremy, having data like this is so useful! Must have just been a fluke that all the jobs I interveiwed for were taken by other TT APs. 11) @10: So you're saying that, if the fraction of TT asst prof positions filled by people who are already asst profs goes from some low percentage (say, 5%) up to 10% (i.e. still a low percentage), we should be worried about job-hopping asst profs putting increasing ""pressure"" on the job market? 12) Nope, 10 didn't write that. 13) I think the trend is real and reflects a new normal for better and/or worse. 14) @13: Um, what ""trend""? How do you know the % of TT jobs filled by people moving from one AP position to another isn't the same or lower than it's been in the past? Do you have data you can link to please? 15) There probably isn't data over time but Dynamic Ecology estimates it was about 12% for the 2017-2018 season (https://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2018/03/08/is-it-common-for-newly-hired-tt-asst-profs-in-ecology-to-have-held-visiting-or-tt-faculty-positions-before-being-hired/)",NA,"Appying for more than 1 job per department I have noticed this situation coming up twice this year so far: a department will want to hire new faculty in one of 2 areas, and both areas relate to my research, for instance one physiology job and one climate change biology job. Well I study thermal physiology under climate change conditions, so naturally I would have applied for either.  How do I approach this? Should I put in my cover letter that I would be a good fit for either? Should I pick one and run with it pretending the other doesn't exist? What about if they are two separate calls? Apply to both? Is there a down side to applying for more than one position at a time? (2) I was in this boat, and I recommend applying for both. These two jobs likely have different search committees, so it probably won't be relevant unless you make the short list for both. Also, sometimes, it is unfortunate but true that there are hidden criteria that might make you a stronger candidate for one job than you would realize based on a superficial read of the jobs. (3) Defintely apply for both. When I was in this position, I emailed search committee chairs to ask how to approach this and they suggested putting in just one application with a clear statement in the cover letter that I am interested in both positions. This might vary from search to search, so I would contact the search committee chairs. Plus it might put your name on their radar. 4) If it is two separate searches, then apply for both. You can't count on one search committee communicating with another, even if they're in the same department! The exception would be if there's a single application link, as in the  jobs (#57/58). In case of doubt, ask the search chair.  5) There may be very little cross talk between committees. I've even seen the same candidate get 2 interviews and score very differently on each.  Go for it.  6) Absolutely apply for both because sometimes there is an issue on the HR end that would make it impossible for your file to be viewed by both committees. (7) I agree ob ""absolutely apply for both!"". Happened to me as well, I submitted the same application, but mentioned in the cover letter that I applied for both and highlighted the positive side of that, that there will be likely a good fit with the other appointment. I think it shows a positive character trait if you are open with it (everybody wants a coleague that is honest and, comittee members might talk. Latest if you get one job people will find out.). Sending in different applications would be weird in my opinion, because it makes it look like you have no clear idea where you are going but just adapt to what the department wants."

Research area is open and faculty in the department study behavior and ecology of bats and crayfish to pick two examples. x2 3) As a wise person once said, ""save your outrage for the volcanologist positions."" 4) Actually, what I said was ""save your snark for the volcanologist posts"". But regardless, it's also true here. 5) The position is titled ""Biomedical Science-Anatomy and Physiology"", there is zero mention of the terms ecology or evolution, and the ""complement"" to others in the dept likely refers more to the molecular/cellular/health folks...this is worse than volcanology. 6) It is very common for human evolution folks to have positions like this one. Last I checked, human evolution was more eco-evo than volcanology. (x2) 7) So all biomedical jobs should now be included on this wiki?  Human evolution is not mentioned in the advertisment.  8) @5 - go to the faculty research interest page and search for ecol and evol. 2 and 14 hits respectively. 9) Those of us who study human evolution are often advised to acquire the skills to teach cadaver-based human anatomy to make ourselves more marketable to non-anthropology departments. Thus, we might very much be eco-evo in terms of research, but often end up in med schools or biology departments teaching anatomy and physiology. 10) #9 also applies to animal eco-physiologists- I commonly teach human a&p because I can get paid for it.  11) This position isn't eco-evo.  Arguing that this is eco-evo because other people in the department study eco-evo is ridiculous.  Other people in my department study cell biology.  I study mammals.  Mammals have cells, but those two facts together don't make me a cell biologist.  And by this logic, all biology jobs are eco-evo jobs... All organisms evolved. 12) arguing that a job that you wouldn't apply for shouldn't be listed here is ridiculous. This is one that lots of evolutionary people would like to apply to, and this resource is for them too. 13) I don't get why this has become such a battle this year. I have been on this wiki for (ahem...too many years). In other years an occasional job gets a comment about not being eco-evo, but it has never been as pervasive or as back and forth as this year. 14) I was hired on for an A&P position. I advise biomedical science majors. I primarily teach A&P-based courses. My research is all evolution of structure and function in ""lower"" vertebrates. Any morphologist/physiologist is mostly acceptable for these types of jobs, especially at smaller schools that have a hard time attracting model organism biomedical science faculty. 15) ""This job is ridiculous and no one would here would apply for it"" seems rather easily falsified by ""I'm here and I apply for those jobs as an eco-evo person.""  16) Too many wiki nazis here. 17) Too many nazis, in general.  18) I was hired to teach A&P originally, but the area of research was open.  At the time, I was a molecular phylogeneticist and a behavioral biologist.  Leave the job postings along a-holes.  19) On the other hand, it is called ""eco-evo jobs"", not ""jobs for eco-evo people (which may or may not be eco-evo jobs)"".

Keep cover letter under 2 pages max and B. Keep it less than a page. What do people here do? 2) 2 pages max (x4) 3) Always 1 page, except for jobs that don't ask for both research and teaching statements. I like Anurag A's example letter. 4) No limit, but under 2 pages is what search committee probably wants as nobody is gonna read more than that. And I disagree with #3. Research & teaching statements are supposed to be supplied separately than cover letter. 5) I've seen lots of successful applicants from friends and mentors and very few (maybe 1 in 10) are less than one page. All were less than two pages and many more like 1.5 pages. That seems like a pretty standard length, though I've also heard some people express a strong opinion that <1 page is better. 6) How many words per page? ~500? 7) I've heard the ""1 page"" argument a lot but I've seen 5 sets of applications that made it to phone interview at R1s and SLACs and not one was less than a page. Keep it under 2, but I'd say 1.5 is pretty standard.  8) I know some search chairs who would kick you out for a 1 paragraph cover letter due to ""your lack of interest"".  I know some other fields have cover letters that say ""Attached is my application"" with little else.  In Evo/Bio that would be deadly.  3 again) @4, I think you misunderstood what I meant. I keep the letter to 1 page if the application includes research and teaching statments. For the rare aplication that does not want research and/ or teaching statements, I send a longer, more detailed cover letter that includes some of the stuff that would have been in the statements. 10) In the UK, applications sometimes request a great deal of information in the cover letter (specific questions to respond to). As an American, I find it weird, but in those cases the cover letter can be several pages long. 11) 1.5 is reasonable regardless of other materials asked, and in response to #3, Anurag's letter is wonderful but I would keep in mind that a) he writes that letter in 1998 and b) he had already published in Nature and Science at the time of application, so if you haven't then maybe talking more about your experiences is a better idea than keeping it too short. 12) I was advised that up to three pages is fine for early-career Asst Profs looking to do a lateral move. That's me, and mine is three pages.

The 'Totaltotenuretrack' tab is new this year and was started after a post that got a lot of circulation on twitter where people were listing stats on the number of applications submitted, etc, before finally landing a tenure track job. So those were kind of meant to be people combining xx number of years of job searching attempts and listing only after getting a job. It was added to the wiki this year and as far as I can tell the two of them have kind of been confused and filled out interchangeably. 5) I'm just shy.  6) AFAICT, everyone posts on TotalToTenureTrack, making the Anon Quals tab redundant and worthless.  It should be deleted. 7) AFAICT, TotalToTenureTrack never should have been added here. It makes no sense on a job board where most poeple have not reached the tenure track (I know some people on here have and are applying to move positions). It was interesting to see those come in on twitter, but on this board it isn't helpful. 8) It wasn't helpful on twitter either - it surprises me that anyone would seriously discuss an analysis with such garbage data. 9) I agree that the data is garbage in several ways, but the alternative is no data!

From what I've been told it varies a lot by which CSU, but none really sound good to work for. 3) It definitely varies a lot across the different CSUs and some have manageable work loads while others are crazy. 4) Most (all?) campuses offer MS degrees but not PhD, at least in Biology/EEB. 5) Echoing what ppl here said re: unreasonably high research expectations. Maybe has to do w/ the fact that the CSUs attract a lot of would-be R1 candidates because of their prime locations... 6) indeed, #5, I'm thinking of applying to a couple of CSUs mostly because I want to move back to SoCal 7) I work at a CSU. It is teaching-intensive and they are also focused a lot on service. At the one I'm employed at, they don't require many papers for tenure. However, you are still supposed to do a lot of research, and involve undergrads and master's students. A lot of the faculty do their personal (without students) research during the summer. I'd continue working at a CSU, mine is just not in the location I desire so I'm looking to switch campuses. The requirements at a different campus would likely be much different depending on the ranking. 8) I work at a CSU, and I love it. I do think it varies a lot across the 23 (!) campuses, but my campus has a really strong mission of providing an affordable education to a broad diversity of students. That mission really motivates me, and it makes the job so much more enjoyable. Our research expectations are reasonable - a few papers [impact doesn't matter], try for grants [don't have to get them], and involve Masters and undergrad students. That being said, I have more time for research than my colleagues at R1s. Note that we are unionized so the tenure process (at least on our campus) is quite clear. 9) Q for ppl who work at these schools: is the salary sufficient to not have to commute >2 hrs a day? 10) That depends where you're located. If you're focused on campuses based near the bay area, I can't answer that but suspect it would be (extremely?) difficult. In the more rural locations, it's absolutely sufficient. Note that the pay for an Asst Prof (~72k, give or take) is somewhat uniform across campuses, from what I've been told. I could be wrong, and hope that the ones located in more expensive areas actually do get more, but that's not what has been communicated to me. That being said, perhaps you can find a situation that works for you in an expensive area on that salary. I also echo the sentiment that the union is great. I had never previously experienced such a dedicated team of people who work for your rights. "

If you're not interested just ignore it. Sure, it may not be useful information for your job search, but neither are half the topics discussed on this wiki. x2 4) Then make your own, separate tab for it. All the rest of us really want is to have a tidy way to keep track of jobs. 5) Isn't that what this tab is for? Shouldn't be in the way of anyone keeping track of jobs. 5) If you put it on the Faculty Jobs tab, it gets in the way. Inevitably, someone starts it on the Jobs tab and it has to get moved elsewhere.  6) Keep the internal candidate crap off the faculty jobs tab. x4 7) And so what if there is an internal candidate? Would you really not apply just because you thought that there might be? It's just a pointless discussion to have at all. x2 7) I didn't apply to a job because I was told about an internal candidate on good authority and it turns out it was correct. Internal candidate got the job. 8) I say a ban is unecessary. As someone writes below, you may prepare an application, get an interview, and do really well, and it goes to someone they had pegged all along. So what? As far as I'm concerned, at least knowing there was an internal candidate that the job eventually went to rules out feeling bad about myself or having to worry about random forces in the job market. It becomes the most plausible hypothesis for why I didn't get the job. And there are plenty of stories where the internal candidate gets stepped over so you are doing yourself a disservice if you take yourself out of the running. 9) The issue is that ""this reads like an internal candidate"" shows up an awful lot, and appears to be based on conjecture (and I agree that it clutters threads). If you have it on good authority (which the rest of us must take on faith), sure, but ""Hm, the way this is worded sounds like an internal hire to me"" doesn't actually help anyone. 8) https://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2017/09/23/hardly-any-ecology-faculty-positions-are-filled-by-internal-candidates-and-you-cant-reliably-identify-the-ones-that-will-be/ 9) Just because they're not at the same university doesn't mean there isn't an internal candidate. My colleague had an inside track for a job position at a different university and was eventually hired by that university. 10) @9: According to the comments in the post linked by #8, it's rare for people to be hired at the uni where they did their PhD, or where they'd previously worked. So your colleague's experience is the exception, not the rule. 11) You're missing my point: candidates have colleagues at universities that grease the wheel and increase their chances of getting hired. He was applying to a collaborators university, he didn't work there or get his PhD there. There are other types of internal candidates than working at or graduating from the university that's hiring. 12) if ""internal candidate"" means ""the candidate knows somebody who knows somebody at the hiring institution"", then half the people who apply for any given position might well be ""internal candidates"".   13) I think you're missing the point of #11, just because you met someone at a meeting and you're applying at the university, doesn't make one an internal candidate. But if you have a working relationship with someone on the search committee, then they can push harder for you. 14) I think it's definitely easier to get an interview at a place where you did your PhD or postdoc, but perhaps because of this, these folks often have slightly less impressive CVs compared to the other interviewees and tend to get passed over. 15) several years ago I interviewed against an 'internal cadidate' (meaning a favored candidate, since they were faculty at another university).  Said 'internal' candidate was also a mentor/role model of mine, meaning I knew a lot of the background on the search. On the interview at the lunch with the grad students, one said something subtle and I suddenly realized what was going on. But I think fixed searches are rare, and there certainly was no tell in the job ad. 16) It is almost always worth applying, even if there is a genuine internal candidate. Last time I was on a SC, there was a candidate we really wanted, invited to apply, and had in mind while we wrote the job ad. She did apply and got an offer, but declined it as she got a counter-offer where she was. Another applicant in the same search was someone we have working with us now on a fixed term contract, who we'd really like to keep permanently -- but there were other candidates who we didn't know but who clearly beat him on experience and publications, so one of them got the job. So inside candidates may not get an offer, and may turn it down if they do. There's an ad about to go out for which I am the inside candidate. The position was created with me in mind and I was asked to comment on the position description before it was finalised, but HR processes require a competitive advertisement and interview process and are enforcing a fair process (they couldn't make the position description or selection criteria too specific, for instance). I do really badly in interviews, so I am hoping there won't be really strong external candidates, because I could still lose out. There's one person on the SC who would like to see that happen. I have a friend who was in a similar situation 3 years ago, and who did lose the position (created with her in mind) to a stronger candidate. Bottom line... don't worry too much about internal candidates. (Except for this job coming up where I am in the internal candidate. Don't apply for that one. Please.) 17) There are indeed ""fixed candidates"". We had to create a position for a spousal hire but HR says we had to advertise the position since it is an academic position. So no matter who applies, we already know who we are going to hire.",NA,Chalk-talk ,NA,"Use of professional email account I already have a faculty position. Is it ok to use my university contact info on applications? 2) That would be the norm, right?   Unless you're worried your Uni is spying on you. 3) Just wondering if it's a misuse of resources - using their email/letterhead/etc. for a reason that isn't related to their goals. 4) No. I think that the norm is to use their letter head, email address etc. However, I'd like to know about how to proceed with getting letters. It's not like you are going to ask your department chair for a letter. (In fact, I was told that at my uni, only HR can provide a letter, and all it will say is that I worked from this year to that year....). 5) Definitely OK  (X2) 6) A lot of people do ask their department chair or a senior colleague to write a letter. 7) Re letters, I'm in a similar situation as the OP, and I've asked a senior colleague that I trust and who shares my concerns about the things pushing me to apply again, but I've been told by folks in other departments that it isn't necessary to have one from the current institution in this situation 6) Yeah I'd defintely be hesitatnt to ask.

I was at a Jesuit school for two years, Jesuits are the most liberal of the Catholics and generally support academic freedom. My department and admin were great, very supportive of eco/evo, supportive of academic freedom. However, I know of another Jesuit school to be great at the department level but the admin sounds like a mess (fights over whether to cover birth control under faculty health insurance, for example). I think you can tell a lot by whether schools require a statement about religiousness with their application and also asking about specific department cultures. 3) I don't think you'll have any issues with the ones I've seen listed here. 4) Besides having a crucifix in every classroom and not covering birth control, Catholic unis are quite typical. 5) I can't speak to a Catholic school, but working at a Methodist-affiliated institution, I've had no problem with being non-religious and openly gay. I respect their faith and they say nothing about what I teach, as long as it is relevant to the subject (evolution fully included).  6) School names can be deceiving.  Would you have a problem accepting a position at Boston College or Georgetown University? Probably not, but they're both Jesuit.  College of the Holy Cross?  Also Jesuit and one of the most liberal of the bunch.  Jesuit colleges and universities have an excellent reputation for academic freedom and you can't go wrong working at one of them x3. 7) Currently a postdoc at a Jesuit school. I was nervous too but its more liberal than the other places I've worked! 8) but what about the diversity of the student body? I want to work somewhere where everyone regardless of religious beliefs can get an education. I would think the pool would be fairly homogenous at a religious Uni, even if a fairly liberal one. 9) Same as 7 again.  The diversity here is much higher than I anticipated.  We have students from all major faiths working in the lab concurrently.  This may be due to the fact we are in a major city?  The classes I've taught have also been very diverse (most non-white and female, many 1st gen immigrants). 10) If you've seen it posted here, it's hardly a problem for staff or student body (excepting the odd BYU post, which is completely the opposite). 11) How widespread is the birth control thing? 12) Looks like in California it was ruled that university health insurance cannot deny faculty birth control or abortion http://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-mh-abortion-rights-victory-20140825-column.html, not sure of other states/universities 13) I worked at a jesuit university for years. Diversity of races/cultures was high...at least as high or higher than a rural state school. Diversity of student-family income was low. These schools will take anyone that has a checking account with a high balance. To me, working at a jesuit university was no different than working at a state institution. How the universities are funded is different, but that has little impact on your day-to-day job. On average, the students were far more prepared for college than a state school, mainly because they were on average from wealthier families with better high school preparation. Did I receive emails about prayer services and such on a regulary basis? Sure. Did I ignore them all? Sure. Did anyone ever say anything or pressure me into going to any religous events? No. ",NA,"Anon Quals Are there plans to have an Anon Quals tab on this iteration of the wiki? 2) My sense is that everyone hated it last year; the data aren't very useful anyway and then got all screwed up by people entering inconsistently.

Would rather have a #totaltott tab with (years on market, no. applications, no. interviews, no. visits, no. offers) 3) eh, the totaltott thing has been done and was better on twitter, I think. Presumably the majority of most active users on here haven't gotten tt jobs yet, so it doesn't make much sense (though I agree with #2 that the totaltott info is more informative). Last year there was a lot of confusion by having both the typical anon quals tab and an added totaltott tab with people entering different kinds of info in each one. 4) I found Anon Quals somewhat interesting and informative.

NA,"Race column on Anon Quali sheet Just curious, what's up with the race column on the anon quali sheet? I don't mind it, nor does the sex column bother me but, no one seems to be entering race, except for a couple. (1) I don't really like it. Creepily, someone entered my race for me! (2) Ah Ha, So you are white! (3) What about adding disability status, sexual orientation, veteran status and the like? (4) Go for it. But, like race, most of you won't answer. Is this too taboo for biologists? Or are we all White, straight, able bodied, conscientious objector, males? (5) Half of us are female. (6) I'm not white; straight, though. (7) We wouldn't know that half of us are female if we hadn't entered our gender. (8) I propose adding columns for name, address, and phone number in the anonymous qualifactions sheet. (9) Yeah, go for it. Post yours.(10) Fisher woudl have predicted that half of you are female... (11) Fisher was also a Eugenicist and would have predicted (or at least hoped) that ALL of you are white. (12) You're probably right #4 and #11. Are there any non-whites here? It seems that there is more diversity in the molecular, genetics, microbio, and like sub-disciplines, but that's just my observation from being a student in 3 schools and having worked in 4 others across the country. EEB programs seem to be pretty homogeneous (faculty and students). (13) Same here, I've seen 4 E&E programs, and observed the ESA meetings. From the Women and Minorities Report II for the ESA, from 2006 - only 8.78% of the ESA members reported themselves as minorities. Up from 6.33% in 1999, but hardly a diverse crowd. Women were at about 25% of the membership. So, diversity-wise, we suck. (14) What is your point? Good science is what matters, race, sex, etc. just don;t matter (15) So does using the right punctuation, dude. My point is that, if you think that all we deal in is science, or that science is, somehow, disconnected from society at large, than you should get your head out of the sand. Otherwise, you'll wake up one day and discover that your funding has evaporated, and that the implications of your research conclusions are ignored.(16) Why 15? Because we are white chocolate? I'm not following the logic. (17) Let me explain, than, 16. We are funded by the public. If we do not relate to that public, if we're not part of that public, or cannot interact with that public, or that public doesn't understand what we do, than they may decide one day that they don't want to fund us. Furthermore, If they don't understand what we're saying, than they won't listen to us. Living and working in magnificent seclusion in an Ivory Tower is not an option, not if you really care about ecological research, and about environmental issues. Looking, as a group, as though we're a bunch of rich white kids, doing stuff that rich white kids do when they don't have to worry about getting a real job, is the quickest way to not being publicly funded, and not being taken seriously. We can sit here and argue which university has the most prestigious grad school program, or which journal is the best, but none of the reasons we mention will convince Joe Smith, Jane Smith, or Jose Morales to part with part of the paycheck they worked for, in order to give money to pay for your study of Nitrogen flux through a plot of eastern deciduous forest or for your salary, capisce? (18) I am ethnic Chinese and can speak with insight that there are so many more Chinese (and other Asian) researchers in molecular, genetical, biochemical research than E&E is because the former is much more ""profittable"" (for lack of a better word). You get much more funding, and more applied business opportunities. This stems from the general preference of pragmatism over idealism of the Chinese. This may or may not apply to other minority groups. The way I see it, no group is being left-out of the E&E because it is for ""elite rich white kids"". Rather, it's just not as an attractive career option to some. And if you want to argue that most white (or any) ecologists can afford to choose this career because they have no financial burdens, you are out of your mind. 
(19) Please read what I wrote BEFORE you respond. I wrote that, because of the lack of diversity, ecology is likely to be PERCEIVED as a place for ""white kids with no financial burdens"", and therefore as unimportant. While nobody is being left out on purpose, this perception is making Ecology an unattractive choice for many people, and can harm support for ecology research and education. I agree that minorities and first generation university students often prefer Majors with higher prestige and higher potential for income. That, however, is not something we can do anything about. We can, though, make a case for ecology being important and relevant for people from all genders, ethnic groups, and income levels. Do you see the difference between that and what you THOUGHT that I wrote? (20) As far as I can tell, most in the general public who perceive ecological research as unimportant use the pretext that there is little practicality to it rather than the apparent lack of diversity. One of the most famous example I know is when John McCain ridiculed funding earmarked for USGS research on grizzly bear population genetics, where he questioned why would anyone want to ""do paternity tests on bears"". Such disregard for ecology and its funding come from a lack of understanding of the use of our work and can only be allayed by ecologists better informing the public. Of course it's good to have diversity, but some problems cannot be solved simply with a few token minority members. (21) Actually, I think the sad truth is that most ppl will perceive something as unimportant if it does not affect them directly and immediately. This is why cancer and stem cell research have access to so much more funding than we do. I'll also argue that this is why Copenhagen was a success.  (22) I totes agree with 17/19!  The liberal-arts/Ivy-league-white-kid perception of E&E definitely contributes to the anti-ivory tower mentality of lots of people.  Having even a few ""token minorities"" (really?  we did get PhDs, same as you...) pulls quite a bit of the air out of this.  Besides, diversity is GOOD for people who are always trying to come up with new ways to answer questions and solve problems!  ",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Late letters How much do late letters of reference hurt you? One letter writer of mine has missed two deadlines. 2) I would use a different letter writer for future apps! Or give them false early deadlines 3) Depends on how late. For some committees, if they had started to review the applications and your letter is not in, either they will contact the letter writer if you are a top candiate or they will just leave you out of any shortlists if you are a marginal candidate. 3) Concur.  If you're a viable candidate, most SCs will not kick you off the list just because of late letters (unless they absolutely can't get your letters). x3  4) IT depends, sometimes not at all since the committee knows this is not your fault. But...at my university: A) the dean cannot approve a short list with an applicant that has an incomplete application, and B) the committee cannot contact a single applicant to let them know their application is incomplete.  So if we want to include U on our shortlst but your slacker writer hasn't submitted a letter, you're SOL!  Point is: some committee's hands are tied by pretty stupid rules. Also: I've never heard of an application with an extra letter getting rejected. So one option is to ask for an extra letter just in case (if you have a slacker).. 1) yeah it is my Phd adviser, so maybe going with the early false deadline route ... 5) To 1: when I was on job market, many of my letters were late or missed. It was mostly due to my bad habit of applying near deadline. I would never know if I lost opputunities because of it, but 2 of my R1 interviews were given when only 2 of my letters were submitted. Overall I will say that it's case by case. However, if your letters are just late but not missed, as a SC I cannot care less about it.  6) Just to reiterate what 4 said, at some universities the committee cannot contact candidates regarding late letters - and I know of universities where a) the search committee doesn't get to see incomplete applications, or b) the search committee can't consider applications with late letters. These rules are dumb, but they exist - 2 of my 3 letter writers were chronically late - I started having to send repeated emails about letters- I wish senior faculty would understand the implications of not providing letters in a timely manner (the situation is different from when they were applying for jobs) 7) Reasonable letter writers will appreciate email reminders. Some of the letter requests are confusing and are easy to be missed.",NA,"Application Gaffes After seeing a recent post about mispelling a university name (and I've switched the order of two-part university names... looking at you ""Forest Lake"") I though it would be ""fun"" to hear about what other people have accidently done in their application process (including interviews) that might bring us some levity. 2) I have definitely submitted applications that still had another schools name or location in the text somewhere and only realized it much later (and probably have done it sometimes without ever realizing). Very embarassing, but I find it really hard to fully proofread all my material over and over for each job...Also, I submitted one job where I accidentally included the text ""I am not a Canadian citizen"" in my cover letter for a job in the US because it had been required for the previous application in Canada. I guess that one just seemed out of the blue to the SC. 3) lol about ""I'm not a canadia citizen"" bit 4) A cut-and-paste error allowed the phrase ""to examine by examining"" to sneak into the first paragraph of a few of my cover letters 5) Last year I was at dinner with the search committee and we all ordered drinks before dinner. After the amuse-bouche, I went to sip from my unreasonably thin martini glass and missed my mouth. I spilled more than half of the drink all over my pants. Fortunately, everyone at the table was engrossed in a conversation about a student, and the restaurant was quite dark, so no one noticed. I excused myself to the restroom and blew-dry my trousers for four minutes - I timed it on my phone so I wouldn't accidentally be in there too long. Honestly, walking back to the table, I didnt even care. I was so pumped because I felt like I absolutely crushed my job talk, and I was so very hungry for my incoming steak frites and the tour of the city I planned with my wife the next day. In the end, they offered me the job. Whether they knew I wasted $18 dollars worth of gin into my breeches, I will never know, but I think about that story so often and laugh while I write new cover letters. I have another interview story that happened a month later if you want more. 6) lol, yes more @5 7) Not nearly as funny as @5 but I as I was leaving an interview with a dean I said, very confidently, ""thank you for the conversation (Wrong Name). She played it off. I didn't get the job. Face palm. 8) The departmental letterhead template I got so I could use it for my coverletters had spellcheck turned off. Took me many rounds of application to realize. So as a result I misspelled words you'd think I would know, like 'species' and 'evolutionary' - sometimes in the job title. -_- 9) This thread is making me feel so much better! I used a cover letter from a previous application for a new application and just replaced the name of the University. The old application was for ""The University of X,"" and the new one was for ""X State University,"" resulting in my cover letter reading ""The X State University"" throughout, like ""I would be thrilled to work at the X State University."" Clearly a find-replace error. Face palm.10) @9 unless you were applying for THE Ohio State University, in which case they would have been flattered that you remembered the ""The"" :-D  11) I study animal behavior and was at an inteview. I was talking with an older faculty member in a loud restaurant. She mentioned something about how the students she is teaching just love reading all the studies by ""blahblah"" but it was so loud in the restaurant and I couldn't hear well, so I just responded ""Oh I don't think I've heard of him before"". She looked at me like I was crazy and then said much more loudly ""You haven't heard of Niko Tinbergen?!"" *face palm* I did not get the job. 12) my lunch with faculty was absolutely horrible, I knew my talk had not been great but on top of that I was talking with food in my mouth. obviously I didn't get the job.  13) I started a video interview with the camera pointed straight at my boobs.  They didn't have a way for you to see yourself on their custom video chat, so there I was up on their big screen, showing off my assets.   No in person interview but now that I'm faculty they've invited me for a seminar.  14) Thanks, OP, this is a great thread! Also you misspelled 'gaffes' :) OP) ... I wish I could say that misspelling was intentional. Big thanks to everyone that has shared their stories so far! 15) blanks where I meant to put collaborating labs... 16) My research statement proposes a local setup, so I adjust the species as necessary, so I've submitted one or two where I write at length about researching local species that don't exist. I think most committees have a sense of humor about them, as I've had in-person interviews on a couple of those. When I tried #13's interview tip all I got was a ""Sir, you're embarrassing yourself"" 17) lol 18) My department fairly often gets applications for University of X but we are X State University. You can survive that gaffe, but it doesn't help. 19) I just noticed that in all of my applications this job cycle I have written ""biostatics"" instead of ""biostatistics"" in my teaching statement. Happy times. 8 again) Welcome to my club, @19! It is a pretty shit club! 20) @19, maybe just switch to electric eels and work on the biostatistics of biostatics? 21) I've made several blunders. that I wrote the wrong job title i.e., Assistant Professor in Evolutionary x instead of Evolutionary y. This was in the first sentence of my cover letter. looool. Balls. ",NA,"Picking references after bad job I had a kinda rough time in my first postdoc - my supervisor was fine, but the rest of the research group was difficult, at best, and I just didn't perform well. I don't think I can ask for a strong reference from that postdoc supervisor. My PhD advisor still should provide a good ref, and my current postdoc advisor, but will using a committee member or other colleague be a red flag, with a missing ref for that 1st postdoc position? Anything I might do to address it? 2) Sorry it didn't work out in your 1st postdoc. I was told that in a situation like this one of your other letter writers (perhaps doctoral advisor) should address it in their letter. The thinking is that coming from a third person the explanation for no productivity during this time would look more impartial. If you were to mention it in your cover letter, then you're running the risk of sounding like you're making excuses or complaining about your situation. 3) I think the fact that you can get a good reference from your current postdoc advisor (and PhD advisor) is the most important thing. 4) I don't think you especially need a reference from the first postdoc as long as you have your current advisor and your PhD advisor and the third writer is someone who makes sense (knows you well). My guess is that most committees wouldn't even comment on the fact that the first postdoc advisor isn't included (unless that advisor was especially well known). 5) (OP) My first postdoc was with someone who was fairly well known in his field, and well-respected - I guess it will mostly depend on who's on the committee, and whether there's anyone who is close to our field   6) I had someone submit a bad rec.  I dropped it and my success rate at scoring interviews went from zilch to several options.  Don't list them, get senior profs in your 2nd pdoc you know well but haven't worked for to write a rec for you.  If asked have a very brief 1-2 sentence explanation that there was a conflict.  Be aware that they will likely contact that supervisor anyway.   A lot of schools are risk averse but some will be willing to hire.  Apply broadly.  It will be harder but can be done.  It may help if everyone in your field knows that lab had issues and if you have published well since. 7) I have a similar situation, but not entirely the same. I would not assume that your PD supervisor won't give you a letter because you didn't get along with the lab. I would be direct with him. From what you described, you aren't on bad terms personally. He might think that you underperformed, but whether or not he liked you might be more important to him. Send him and email, explain that you are applying for this job and ask him ""would you be comfortable providing me a letter of recommendation for this position."" If he isn't, either he won't respond, or he will tell you that he can't. If he is, he will say that he can. Just because he is a big name, doesn't mean that the search committee is going to be in love with him. If you are a big name in the field then a lot of people also have opinions about you. The bigger the name the more polarized the opinions tend to be. So, your advisor's letter may not carry as much weight as you think if the search committee isn't a fan of him. Also, your poor experience in that lab may just reinforce what others in the field already know about that lab. I have come to this realization after having a PD advisor who I am really tight with. Everyone has opinions about everyone else they never share them with students and only sometimes with PDs. Academia is strange. Don't assume anything. 8) I'm working through roughly the same situation, PD#1 was rough and I ended up with a bit of a gap in my publishing record as well as not being 100% confident in PD advisor's ability to write a strong letter. PD#2 is goign well, and I'm sure my current advisor will write a strong letter, but how bad is it if there's an obvious lull in productivity for that PD AND I don't have a letter from them? 9) OP here, that's basically the exact situation I'm in. I'm using committee members, instead, which I think still makes sense"

Curious about whether people tend to wear their wedding rings on interviews... particularly women, as young married women may come off as a hiring 'risk' if they're married (you know, because we're just going to work for a few years, have a baby, and never do any productive science again...) 2) I would certainly hope people would not penalize especially if they are trying to promote diversity in STEM 3) I think it falls into the implicit bias category, so whether or not people are cognizant of avoiding those biases may make a difference, though I agree with #2 that in an ideal world, it wouldn't come into play 4) I take off my rings (which aren't wedding rings), in case anyone makes any assumptions. 5) I've never head of this mattering, and it could also work the other way (eg, if some old-timer sees it as a sign of immaturity or something) 6) Well, someone who is implicitly biased will hardly go around talking about the applicant with the wedding ring, because it's *implicit* bias. 7) These aren't necessarily from Eco-Evo, but I doubt we're really all that different: https://www.theatlantic.com/sexes/archive/2013/01/being-married-helps-professors-get-ahead-but-only-if-theyre-male/267289/ and https://jezebel.com/fathers-and-childless-women-in-academia-are-3x-more-lik-1758704068 8) I'm visibly pregnant this round so that should be fun.

In the end, I wore my wedding band. I did get a job, so obviously it doesn't matter to some. But I didn't *talk* about being married (or having a small child) to any of the people who interviewed me.

Decided to wear my ring because a) my husband doesn't need a spousal hire, and b) the interview was in an area with a very conventional marriage culture.  I was asked what my husband does (got the question I was trolling for!), but only after I mentioned I was married. I felt like this was the most honest way to play the game, but it was also a strategy tailored to the particulars of the institution where I was interviewing. 12) I was told to take it off (female), but left it on.

NA,"When unsuccessful What will you do if you do not get a job in science? (1) After the last strong of rejections, I am going to look for different types of work. (2) Faculty positions are not the only jobs in science. There are NGOs and government agencies at all levels that need good scientists. There are also all kinds of organizations that need the kind of skills that a PhD program in biology provides. Some of them may not even know it yet. We have almost all of us been done a disservice by an educational system that holds the Professor up as the only legitimate role model for young scientists. Maybe this explains why we're all killing each other to get jobs that, in many cases (to judge by some of the comments on this wiki), we don't even particularly want. There are places to look other than academia before calling it quits; some of these places actually offer jobs with good salaries, good benefits, and reasonable demands on one's time. Why everyone thinks of these as a last resort, or doesn't even think of them at all, is beyond me. (3) Lawn Care!  My summer job during high school with no responsibility and plenty of sun.

(7) true 6, the nonacademic posts need people who produce.  However, I think we should look at it as good academic jobs vs good nonacademic jobs.  Here you will find that both are equally competitive.  A great Museum job, or USGS job will have just as tough a playing field as a great university job.  However, a state/fed job that amounts to little more than pushing papers will be hit or miss depending more on the interviewer than the interviewee.

How common is this? Of course I know that expectations and startup ranges vary hugely from department to department, but this seems quite different. 6) And keep in mind that it's all relative, at some places on the wiki this year you literally get just a sewing machine and thread. 7) Do SLAC typically offer startup money?",NA,"References I have a list of references that includes academic mentors and colleagues. The list includes Associate Professors and Full Professors. A colleague that works for an agency and a current collaborator on an external grant has offered to be a reference for me. We have a solid research history together and if I was at a different institution it would be easier to fund my research. Is it common or beneficial to have professionals outside of acadmia be a reference? Specifically, this reference would speak to the future funding opportunities I would have from their agency if hired. 2) I don't think it would hurt, list it at the end of all of your references though. 3) I'm also interested in this. I have a reference who is a director of a regional section of a federal agency. I've wondered about how best to utilize him. Research heavy positions seem ideal since they are a major source of funding in my field, but not sure whether search committee's are looking for only academic folks. 4) OP here. I asked the same question to one of my academic references and their response was, it is not uncommon to have non-academic scientists as references as long as they are in a senior roll. The individual I was talking about is not in a senior position but does have control over some grant funding. I ended up not including them as one of my references but will bring up the collaborations in my cover letter or research statement. 5) Rather than start a new thread, does anyone have advice on this in terms of SLAC's? One of my references is a collaborator and a bigshot with a federal agency that controls lots of funding in my field. They are well respected acadmically, a great person, able to weave a good story, and I have no doubt their letter is excellent. My other two references cover teaching in-depth so their input is mostly on research. I wonder though, from the perspective of smaller schools, whether his position is seen as *big shot* like it is in more research-oriented places where his letter signifies $$$$$? 6) @5, I would imagine SLACs also see that his letter signifies funding potential, and would be to your benefit!",NA,"CV formatting question A search committe member from last year gave me feedback on my application. One piece of advice they had was that they felt like my first authored publications were a bit 'lost' because I've had a lot of collaborative papers where I am a middle author. My total number and journal placement for first author papers is very good and my ratio is about 1:1 first author to middle author, but in the last year for various reasons I had a large group of co-authored papers come out, with just a usual number of first authored papers. The result is that some pretty recent first authored papers are pushed far down my list of publications. This committee member suggested that I might think about having two separate sections for a) first authored papers and b) collaborative papers OR that I might think about having some kind of selected publications or most relevant publications or (?) to highlight the papers that I was the lead on. Now that I'm revising materials for this year I'm thinking again about this comment, but it just seems very odd to me to split the section up like this and I've never seen an example (other than something like a biosketch for a grant) where this is done. None of the example job applications I've seen have done this. Does anyone think this is actually a good idea or is it better to just stick with the usual reverse chronological order? 2) could you ""cheat"" a bit and put some recent, but slightly older, first author pubs ahead of co-authored papers? 3) I wouldn't do it. It would look odd. Most people bold their name, so a quick skim should see where you are on the author line. But, you should always be trying to match 1st authors with collaborative works.Switching order within a year so it looks better for you is valid, though. 4) Recent N. American search committee member here. I've never seen anyone do this, and never heard any other search committee member express a desire for this. Reverse chronological order is indeed the convention, for good reason--search committees want a sense of what you're currently working on and how it's developed or changed from what you used to work on. But it's not a big deal; if you're competitive, your cv will get a close look, even if your cv is formatted slightly unconventionally. 5) It's odd advice and I'd take it with a grain of salt. No one should be punished for being involved in collaborative papers if they are still leading a decent number themselves. I'd stick with a standard format (a decent search committee should have no trouble) and highlight some of your papers in the research statement 6) I agree with the others - stick with reverse chronological order, but do bold or underline your name so it's easy for people to see when you were the lead author 7) OP: Thanks all. I agree that it seemed like odd advice but this person suggested that it was a point of discussion in deliberations (I was on the short list but not interviewed). I do have my name bolded and I'll maybe change the order within each year. 8) #5 here again. If a search committee is slightly concerned that you're over-focusing on collaborative work recently, there are other, better ways to allay that concern besides rearranging your cv. For instance, you could talk in your cover letter and research statement about your various lines of independent and collaborative research, talk about how you balance your independent and collaborative work, and note that it's just happenstance that you had many collaborative, middle-authored papers come out recently. 9) To be honest, this just sounds like a lazy criticism of your CV from the SCM. I highly doubt this actually affected their decision very seriously. It's not like having fewer co-authored papers would make your record look better. 10) I second #8.  Talk about your most important recent work in your cover letter (in 3-4 sentences) and in your research description (a couple paragraphs).  I also agree with #9. 11) I suggest listing the # of first-authored pubs (as well as total number, citations, etc) at the top of the references.  Also bold/underline etc your name.  Also suggest highlighting cases where the lead is your student or a student you mentored (depending on career stage).  Also keep in mind that in some fields the senior author is last, so that is a cultural convension that may warrent explanation depending on your background and dept applied to."

Does this always mean move on now or has anyone heard something from a school even after not making the initial call back? Just curious.  2) what does ""move on"" mean? there still may be a chance they'll contact you but I wouldn't count on it. In my experience (last year) many committees never let me know of a rejection. The few that did often did so well after the search. 3) Agree that knowing others made the short list doesn't look good for your chances... in my apps last year, hearing back until months after (e.g. apply in Sept, radio silence until end of December when notified search was complete) was the normal if I didn't hear about an interview within a few weeks 4) I've had a couple of times where I saw that phone/skype interviews had gone out on the wiki and then ended up getting an invitation for one 2-3 days after the first posting on here. My guess is they were sending out invitations and filling the schedule in stages. But after a couple days my impression is that it would be pretty unusual to be contacted. 5) #1 here again--thanks all; that gives me some perspective. Moving on just being not holding out hope that I'll be contacted (even if it is for a rejection). 6) I know someone who didn't make the short list, they interviewed 5, couldn't agree on any, then called up the 6th person much later, asked them for an interview, they were great, and got hired. Very rare, but does happen. This is why if you're on the long short list but not the short short list, you tend not to get a rejection.  The committee is keeping their options open just in case. 7) I ended up in a second round of skype interviews a for a job a couple of years ago - I guess they didn't like enough people from the first round to fill campus interviews.  I ended up with a campus interview but didn't get the job.  This seems rare but no need to totally give up hope if you're not in round 1! 8) People also drop out of searches for various reasons and often are replaced by runners up 9) #8, not all. some folks drag out the process in order to get a better deal with another offer and in the end manu searches fail because of that",NA,"Applying for R1 jobs when you don't want an R1 job?

I'm super excited about the public R1 job I took - I will be teaching two great classes, working with great colleagues, and will have the chance to reach a huge diversity of students who might not have the chance to attend a private SLAC.

I am an extreme introvert, but do work well with others; I am collegial and have had several successful scientific collaborations. The interview process as it currently exists (Skyping with a group of people, 3 straight days of conversation) is not where I shine. Any one else experience this? Do you think there is ever a chance of multiple formats being offered? Just like standardized testing, I feel like this interview format reflects how well people do at that specific format rather than how they might truly perform on the job. Are SCs overlooking some of the best candidates because they are introverts? 2) I wouldn't count on the standard interview process changing dramatically over any timeframe that would be relevant for your goal of landing a job. I think a huge percentage of us are introverts and not naturally good at interviewing. So, I think the best way to overcome this is to practice your interview skills. 3) Absolutely with the practice, #2! I'm thinking about this outside the context of myself. When all of us introverts (or you extroverts who know how wonderful working with us introverts can be) land jobs, perhaps we can work to make the hiring process more inclusive in the future! Who's in? 4) if u cant handle 3 days of conversations with interested parties, im not sure how you think you can be successful as a prof. the job is far harder than that, for introverts and extroverts alike. 5) I experience that too OP 6) @4, you seriously can't see a difference between the job of a professor and a series of 30 minute 'interviews' that involve making impressive small talk with strangers? Of course we have to do it and practicing helps, but there is totally disingenuous to deny that those types of interactions are much much easier for some people to pull off based on personality and that there is little reason to believe that doing those well is directly related to overall job performance (yes, I realize that some small parts of being faculty will be similar, but writing grants/papers, teaching, and advising have a much different structure than those short interactions). Two years ago I had an interview in which I was told afterwards that the committee agreed that I had the best record, the best research talk, and the best phone interview (which is different because it is easier to prepare answers to structured questions), but that I just wasn't perceived as 'excited enough' about the position in one on one interactions. It is hard not to interpret that as a popularity contest in which extroverts will always win over introverts, so I sympathize a lot with the OP here. Incidentally, I had a very similar experience at the grad student and postdoc application phase, but once I got into both of those positions I have been very successful and have lots of ongoing collaborations. I just think that these 30 minute 'interviews' are not very informative and are so vulnerable to various kinds of subconcious biases. I do agree with 2 though that none of this is likely to change anytime soon. 7) @6 what is the alternative? dont talk to people before hiring them? you cant be serious. 8) I agree that it's not really reasonable to do away with in-person interviews altogether (not sure if that was OP's suggestion though). I don't really think you can be an effective all-around professor if you aren't able communicate with people, and the in-person interview, while not perfect, is a good way to judge this skill. Plus, the on-campus interview is only one aspect of the overall interview process. You don't even get to this stage until you are a top three contender. I think there might be something to be said though for changing the standard 2-day meetining with 30+ people. 9) I agree, the campus interview schedule should just be toned down a bit. In my experience, I'm usually scheduled with 12+ hours of meetings/meals/socializing per day over several days, and I'm always completely wiped out for the last few hours of each day. It's hard to shine in your 9th straight hour of high-pressure small talk, especially for the extremely introverted. 6) @7 I did say that I don't see the culture changing anytime soon, but lots of industries outside of academia hire highly skilled people by evaluating the actual skills they are expected to use in the jobs rather than through a series of informal/kind-of-formal interview/kind-of-chats with people. If you describe the length and design of the academic interview to people unfamiliar with it they think it is crazy. I realize there are some reasons for it to be set up the way it is in academia, but the idea that interviews just have to be this way is simply wrong. 10) Also worth noting that academic culture in countries outside the US often involves many fewer of these type of interactions with shorter and more focused interviews overall (often with multiple candidates interviewing together) and (in some cases anyway) more transparent evaluation procedures. x2 11) OP here - thanks for your support @6 and others (except @4 - lol). It's certainly not that we introverts ""can't handle it."" I personally have had 3 fly-outs and I think they all went really well (still waiting to hear on all of them, but have gotten positive feedback) and I think I'd make a great professor. I'd just love some collective conversation about how we might be more inclusive in hiring when we're in charge. For example, perhaps a half-day team brainstroming session around an idea that could substitute for a half-day of 30-minute interviews could be informative? I agree that the skills demonstrated in the 30-minute interviews are valuable, and I wouldn't propose cutting them all together. Just like universal design in the classroom though, I think the entire process could benefit from considering different modalities of processing information and communicating. We'd all be better for it and we'd capture tthose introverts who have a LOT to bring to the table but that aren't as good at mimicking extroversion. x3 12) Interviewers in most other countries are far shorter and feel less of a stamina test as a result. My total interview process in Europe for multiple positions has been <3 hours. This has obvious downsides; you don't get a good feel for the department and they get less of a feel for you. But it avoids this problem, which does seem extreme. In what other job is an interview effectively a 16-hour x 3 day affair? 13) Not even MDs do this and they are real doctors. 14) I think chalk-talks are a good way to increase the diversity of interactions, similar to the brainstorming session that 11 suggests. 15) @13, I make this joke a lot too, but I recently learned that PhDs have a much longer history as doctors than MDs. It's only the last century, give or take, that MDs have had to go through an intensive training process like PhDs. 16) At this (sad) point, I think I have done every kind of interview under the sun, from 30 minute UK affairs to 3-day 14-hour-per-day marathons in the U.S. There is definitely a middle ground that I absolutely prefer, which is a 1.5 day visit, where the first afternoon includes the more formal committee interviews/seminars/chalk talks, and the second full day includes meals, tours, and 1-on-1 meetings with faculty, admin, and students. That is really more than enough time to suss out the department IMO. 17) OP here - update - this introvert got an offer in an expanding department, and I will absolutely implement this to the best of my ability when I'm on future SCs for our dept 18) My experience at primarily undergraduate institutions: (1) ""I understood every sentence in that talk [it was at a first grade level] and the speaker was super fun...let's hire them!!!"" (2) ""That speaker really made me think about biological processes and is doing cutting edge research, but didn't involve the audience and was monotone....hard pass!!!"" Prepare accordingly. 18) @6, if I didn't know better I'd think I had written your response! It was super frustrating to be told: we all liked you and thought that you performed best on every objective criteria that we evaluated and probably would have put together the best research program if you came here, but another candidate was just more enthusiastic (i.e., extroverted). I would have rather not gotten the feedback. 19) OP - again. This is EXACTLY the kind of thing I want to avoid in the future, @18. They missed out on you, and I don't want our institution to miss out on others like you. Any thoughts on interview activities which would have highlighted your talents (other than the SC getting bias training)?"
NA,"the lone ecologist. Boo Hoo :( It's hard enough to get a job in academic biology. But what if the job is in a department with NO other ecologists? Any one have any experience with this kind of position. How do you attract students, etc. Can always keep postdocing, but I've got a hungy family to feed. Obviously, it a personal decision, but hearing what others think might help  (1) Don't do it! Get a job with the government if you need to. (2) If it is a primarily teaching college/university, that may be more common than you realize. It will also be less of a problem than you realize - teaching issues are similar for most physical sciences. On the other hand, if it's a research university - do not take the job! No collaborations, and often unrealistic tenure expectations (for example, their funding expectations are based on access to NIH and biotech funding grants). (3) Get what you can! (4) I agree with 3.  You can always job search again if it sucks too bad, but at least your family is eating.  This job market is too bad to mess around.  On the other hand, if you keep postdocing, that's 1 less on the market competing with me ;) (4) If you're desperate, then get what you can and make the best of it. If you have money, hire a post-doc or two, rally up some undergrads, recruit grad students at meetings, invite some EEB speakers, do anything to stay plugged into the EEB scene. Again, to echo what was written on the Texas school post (under 11/25/2009), being the sole ecologist can be miserable! So if you're not DESPERATE, why put yourself throught it? (5) My 2 cents: I was the lone ecologist, but eWhineually was able to expand our department to include 3 other ecologists in the department...the first 3 years were tough though but we are currently hiring yet another ecologist (the score is now Cell Smashers 9, Tree Huggers 5).

I miss the daily face-to-face interaction I had w/ecologists at the larger R1 where I was a postdoc, but am glad I have a permanent position.   Many advantages to having a monopoly on ecology.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Optimism First time on the market... am I stupid to be so optimistic about my chances of getting a job? After each final read-over of my applications I think to myself ""I could get this!"" 2) I think it shows you've made the best possible application you can, and I think search committees see that when they read through things (vs. mimimally tailored apps). Or maybe I'm just stupidly optimistic too... though the alternative of being super negative likely doesn't improve your odds of success at getting a job... so here's to optimism!  3) My strategy is cautious optimism, i.e. if something works out, I'll be pleasantly surprised. 4) I, too, was optimistic my first year, and although I made a few shortlists, nothing materialized and I was rather dejected. What I did notice, however, was how random the people getting hired seemed to be. People who I would consider superstars would get passed up for people with less-impressive CV's. In some strange way that comforted me. x2 5) Keep up the otimism as long as you can.  For many, perserve long enough and something will come through.  When you quit thinking you could get this job, it shows, and becomes a self-fufilling prophecy.  Also, @ #4, it's usually not (totally) random but can be due to subtle things such as ""fit"", including (especially) dumb-ass things the person with an awesome CV said in person on the interview.  Ya gotta have a good CV, but ya gotta also not be an ass, or clueless about the institution. Last search I was on we passed on a ""superstar"" or three. 6) ""Fit"", pedigree and contacts matter.Sometimes, they'll shortlist someone with a much shorter CV (in a comparable time frame). 7) One common instance where they will pass over a rockstar is at teaching-focused institutions. They don't want to hire someone that's going to leave in a year or two and is only working at that institution as a placeholder. 8) I am having this issue right now. I would be more than happy getting a more teaching oriented position and I have extensive teaching experience, but my CV suggests I could get a position in a more research oriented R1 institution (as also shown by where I got campus interviews). But I do not get interviews at less prominent instituions more focused on teaching because I think they get scared I won't take offers, or leave later. As a result, I have not had any offers. Not quite to rockstar level but good enough that I scare less prominent departments... 9) Take a careful look at how you present yourself in your applications for these positions. Move your teaching record in front of your research record in your CV and make sure your cover letter shows evidence (not just motherhood statements) of a real interest in teaching, if it doesn't already.",NA,"Tracking down prospective colleagues before applying for a job The application deadline for a position I really want is after a major conference where faculty from that university will be. Am I supposed to find as many of them as I can and make sure they know who I am? Or is that too pushy and desperate? And what should I even ask/say to them? 2) Sounds like a great opportunity to introduce yourself, talk about research/teaching (depending on institution) and the specifics of what they're looking for and how you fill the need. Keep it light, show genuine interest, but be realistic about what you're doing and your application. If your CV doesn't stack up this isn't going to take you from the trash heap to the in-person interview, but if you're on the border between getting a phone interview and going to the trash heap it has a good chance of earning you a phone call. 3) brief interactions at conferences won't make any difference to the fate of your application. 4) How about you email them in advance and invite them to your talk/poster? That doesn't seem too pushy and might put you on their radar. 5) I disagree with #3.  The two interview invitations I had so far in the U.S. this year came from Departments in which I had previously met people at conferences and made connections with them.  Networking is the number 1 strategy.  It seems different in the UK, in which I had three interviews without knowing anyone. 6) I've had 14 on campus interviews in my career.

NA,"Interview ""attire"" Was wondering if people had advice on what to wear to the campus interview (for guys).  Is a suit too much?  I was debating between suit or sport jacket, nice shoes and ""dress"" pants...what is common protocol? Suit.  (2) suggestion from last year was to dress up one level from what you would normally wear on the job.  Don't think a suit is over kill if you have one.  (3) I've always heard that you won't offend anyone by over-dressing-up. (4) get a tux. seriously though, business-casual to business-semi-formal is appropriate. (5) Suit is an overkill, however, a jacket of some sort-is advisable.  You can't go wrong with a nice ""tweed"" coat! (5) The best advice I received was, ""wear something that is not memorable, but be sure to look like you care"". Since I'm a woman, ""something memorable"" might have a slightly different meaning, but the take home message is that you don't want them to remember your clothes, but you do want them to know you are taking things seriously.  (6) Because I am not accustomed to wearing suits, I won't wear one to an interview - I'm fairly sure my discomfort in one is obvious and detracts from my confidence.  Everyone has his/her own comfort level and dressing up for the sake of dressing up can (at least in my case) have negative consequences. (7) What about for women?  I find this so confusing! (7)The advice given by #s 4 and 6 is good to consider for women. Most importantly, nothing too revealing or suggestive. After that, wear something that you feel comfortable in and is nice enough to show that you have taken the time to think about it. Nice pants and shirt/sweater or skirt and shirt/sweater (with your own sense of style) seem about perfect. I've sat on a few of search committees and in all cases clothes didn't matter much except for a couple of cases, and then they really seemed to color people's opinions. The first was when someone just didn't appear to care at all (crumpled jeans and t-shirt) and the other was a woman who wore A LOT of make-up and showed a little too much. Personally, I didn't think either assessment was fair, but unfortunately those silly things made a difference.  (8) I usually wear a head dress made from feathers of endangered birds, rhino skin cowboy boots, fluorescent hot pink leotards, and vampire fangs.  Ok, seriously, dress nice, this is not an interview at McDonalds. (9)  On the other hand, if you do wear a suit - make sure that it fits and that it looks good on you.  That feel that you're ""lookin' sharp"" helps your self confidence immensely.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Phone Interviews First time on the market...when should I expect contact for phone interviews if I made it into that pool? I'm sure there is varability but I'm wondering other's experiences. Thanks! 1) Highly variable. I have kept track over the years and it's usually around 2 weeks after the closing date, if there is a hard closing date. The longest I waited was 7 weeks. 2) 2-6 (not counting some final-round interviews that were phone interviews for logistic reasons). 3) From other forums the average seems to be 6-7 weeks 4) I would say 3-5 weeks in my experiences. The earliest has been 2 weeks once out of 60 total applications across the years 5) Two weeks is the earliest I've heard anything, but it has usually been more like 1-2 months. x3 6) just heard back after 1 week for one application. By far the fastest that I've heard back. 7) @ #6 for where?! 8) Jeez - one week for an interview request is nuts! 9) #6 must be a rockstar. I've never heard of a turnaround that fast. 10) @9: Senior faculty member here who's sat on search committees. Turnaround rates vary widely for many reasons, having nothing to do with whether the candidate is a ""rockstar"". You cannot glean any information about anything from the speed with which a search proceeds.   11) Remember how hard it was to get three profs into a room for a committee meeting?? Now try doing that three times in one semester when search committee members are traveling.  And some searches have to present at faculty meeting first.  Scheduling will be chaotic, but occasionally it happens fast.  ",NA,"Research Statement Length (not poll) Of those of you who have served in search committees, do you care how long research statements are? I have one 4.5 pages long, very detailed, versus one 2.5 pages long not so detailed. Which one should I submit to places where they don't specify research stament length? 2) I've served on one committee. I don't recall ever seeing a statement as long as 4.5 pages, most are under 3 pages. I think most people would have been annoyed with a 4.5 page statement.x2  3) I wouldn't say that I would be annoyed...but I might not read it all in ""detail."" Thus, your shorter less detailed research statement would probably suffice. 4) I would be annoyed at a research statement that long. At the same time, I've been adamant on the SCs that I've served on and chaired that we specify the length we want in the job announcement. 5). I've served on search commitees and there was a recent twitter poll and thread on this. The consensus was 3-4 pages for R1 (and other reserach-heavy institutes) and 2 pages for more teaching-focussed institutions. 5) Thank you #4! Please tell us how long of a research statement you want. 6) OP-Thanks! I guess it also depends on font size, line spacing, etc. I'm applying mostly to R1s so I guess I'll stick with the 4 pages long but will make it a bit shorter so that it's 3-3.5 pages long.

NA,"transcripts Is it just me or that more and more SC's are asking for transcripts these days? One of my old mentors said that in his days he never bothered answering any ads that asked for transcripts. But it seems everyone asks for them now, including many RU/VH schools like Florida and Penn State. It may just be you - I've never heard of such a thing. (2) varies. The one that irritates me is reference letters. A LOT of places ask for them up front. I will never do this when I run a search committee. 90% of the time they are of no use until very late in the process. Also, if everyone did it this way, all of us would have fewer letters to write for people too. Its a win-win situation. Lets face it, there is no need for letters for someone whose resume alone doesn't even rank in the upper half of the applicants! (3) To #2, the question was about transcripts, not LoR. However, I agree with you about LoR. (4) to #3, yes I know. I was just stating! (5) #2,4, the question was about TRANSCRIPTS, let's read the question, eh! :( (6) to #1: what haven't you heard? That there are more transcript requirements? That more RU/VH schools are asking for them? That applicants in the old days could afford to be more selective? (7) right on #2, couldn't agree more. (8) to #6: I was answering the question :^). 7) I agree w/ #1...haven't had any transcript request....seems bizarre (8) ...I have noticed this trend (of asking for transcripts) also, and I don't like it. I have not applied for jobs (that I otherwise would have) when they ask for transcripts. I feel this has no bearing on my past research record. How I did in a class on the Geography of Australia, or Special Relativity Physics is not relevant compared to my direct and measurable contributions (i.e. publications/presentations/grants) in my current field of ecological research. I have been an independent research scientist for the past 10 years (grad school + postdoc) - if they can't judge me on that, then I don't want their job. (9) Good for. If some committee ( or more likely a University requirement) wants to see what classes i took 10 years ago, big deal. (10) Probably because of those high-profile cases where different admins were discovered to lack the credentials they claimed, so HR departments are now required to check ALL degrees. It is, of course, illogical, since all they need for a faculty hire is evidence of the terminal degree, but again, logic and HR ave little do do with one another. (11) Yeah, you'd be silly not to apply on this basis...it's probably just an odd HR requirement of a few schools (12) Silly old me ;) (13) I am on a search committee that requires transcripts, for a couple of reasons. First, we want to make sure you got the degrees you claim you did. We require undergrad transcripts as well because we're a liberal arts school, and if you claim to have a LA degree, we'd like to confirm that. Second, if you don't want our job badly enough to send copies of your transcripts, we don't want you to apply. Seriously, I've got enough work to do as it is. I should point out that unless the job ad specifies OFFICIAL transcripts, it's (probably) okay to send a photocopy or scan and note in your cover letter that you're happy to follow up with officials should they be required. 
(14) It is a somewhat logical requirement for teaching-focused schools, since you want to know which courses the applicant took, and therefore can teach. However, for research universities it's ridiculous. I write somewhat, since courses that an applicant took 10 years earlier are a bad indication of teaching ability in the present, and from the words of the previous poster, it looks like an additional hoop to jump through (to quote: ""if you don't want the job bad enough...""). Be that at is it may, it's a buyers market, and we jump through the hoops to get the jobs. As a requirement, this is truly not an onerous one, especially since the great majority of the locations do not require official transcripts until the hire, so, at most, it's the cost of a photocopy (or a scan). LoR's up front are a bigger annoyance. (15) I pretty much have to agree with 14...it's a pretty easy hoop to jump through. I personally don't care if they ask for 8x10 glossies of my father-in-law's dog in a tuxedo...if it's in the ad and I want the job, they're going to get it from me. That's the way it goes. When I get the position and am on a search committee in the future, I can worry then about what is logical or not. Until that day, if you think it's too much hassle to follow the instructions in the ad, feel free to not apply...it will help me out in my own search. (16) To #15, your facetious comment: ""personally don't care if they ask for 8x10 glossies of my father-in-law's dog in a tuxedo"" suggests that anything a hiring committee asks for is fair game. But, in fact, most people would agree that this is not true. If they asked us if we were gay or straight, able-bodied or disabled, jewish or catholic, married or single, many of us would rightfully object. Similarly, we might object if they asked for blood work or imposed a drug test. Many of these factors can impact job performance (positively or negatively) in an academic environment, but the fact that we have excluded these areas either by collective agreement in the academic community or by law, means that there can be debate about what is ""fair game"" in a job search. I don't put academic transcripts in the same category as sexual orientation, but many people might have valid reasons to object - and it doesn't seem reasonable to quash those objection simply by pointing out that academic hiring is ""buyer's market"" right now. (17) My facetious comment was not meant to imply that people shouldn't object...it was meant to inject some small amount of humor into a tense job market. However, the fact remains that if the SC asks for anything legal (unlike sexual orientation, etc. that you mentioned), you must make a choice to either send it (and remain in consideration for the job) or not to send it (and send the message that you don't want the job after all, or, worse, that you can't follow instructions). I will admit that I can't think of a valid reason to not send a transcript other than that it is a hassle, but that certainly doesn't mean there isn't a valid reason. Again, I'm not trying to dismiss, belittle, or offend anyone, but, in my opinion, until we are in positions to change the system, we have to work with it.(18) Lighten up 16, 15's comment about the dog was hilarious. I already have my transcripts scanned in - so for me, it adds an extra 5 seconds to attach them to the email. Certainly not worth the time this discussion has used up. But I do look forward to more dog tuxedo comments from 15/17! (19) Thanks for the support 18. Mine are scanned too, and this discussion has definitely gotten out of hand. The saddest part about the whole discussion...my father-in-law's dog doesn't even OWN a tuxedo ;) (20) Ha! you think you've got it hard - MY father-in-law doesn't even own a dog :-D (21) Crap! I don't even have a father-in-law! (22) My father-in-law is a dawg! (23) @15, 19-22: thanks for the laughs! I needed that!",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Curatorial Experience Does anyone here have insight into how much curatorial experience matters for positions that include some amount of museum curation in the job description? For example, if you study birds and could easily teach an ornithology class and maybe even have done some collections based research but have never specifically worked in a museum based position, is it even worth applying for this kind of job? Many of them (even at some fairly large collections) seem to least curatorial experience as a 'preferred' rather than 'required' qualification. I also have known some 'faculty curators' who seemed to have relatively little day-to-day responsibilities in the museum. I'm sure this varies from job to job, but I'm just trying to gauge whether it is really worth spending time on applying for those positions. 2) Depends on what the museum is looking for. A lot of museums these days are looking for cheerleaders of the museum that are doing sexy research and a lot of outreach. In those cases, the people who have been hired are not what I would consider your traditional curators. Other museums are still focused highly on taxonomic studies and building museum collections and tend to still hire people with a lot of curatorial experience. Just depends on the direction of the museum. 3) Yeah, I think if you're an ornithologist, to get hired as a curator you'd have to have some kind of research using the collection as well as contributing specimens to it, though there are exceptions. 4) It depends on whether you're talking about a staff curator position, or a faculty curator position. When I was a grad student in the MVZ, one of the job candidates (who did great research) showed up and said ""I don't think we need to collect any more, all we need to do now is scan everything and put it online!' (I'm paraphrasing).  Needless to say, this person was not offered the job.  But I think a person who understood the importance of the collections and whose research used the collections could land a faculty curator position, even if they personally had never filled a loan or done an accession themselves. But if the position is for a staff curator, previous experience in this would be important. OP) Thanks for the answers. This is pretty much in line with what I was thinking. My takeaway is that my chances for these kind of positions are pretty slim, but that there is probably just enough of a chance (at least at some places) to make it worth applying. I guess I'll bite the bullet and add those to my list... 5) Doing molecular phylogenetics certainly helps... 6) Also phenetics too...  7) I'm at one of these positions, and we are hiring in our museum this year, FYI. If the material doesn't show that you can walk in and grow a nationally-reputable collection (permits, collecting, specimen preparation, etc.) and that you could manage a collection manager, you won't make the short lst. However, as #2 says, it depends. You should look at the other curators, are they figureheads, or are they collections-builders? It should be really easy to tell.",NA,"Question for current professors  Do you feel satisfied when you finally get a job? I ask because of the idea of the hedonistic treadmill - the anticipation of getting a new thing is much better than the thing, and that the joy wears off. I have seen it in my own career, climbing higher and higher, but at each step the hours are longer, the competition is stronger, and my happiness is lower. I have a feeling that it will continue into a professorship. I turned down an offer last year and I'm applying this year, but I'm curious if it just keeps getting worse? Thanks in advance for any comments. 2) I had five years of postdoc (2 research and 3 teaching) before landing my current TT job. Yes, I'm pretty happy. Things could be better (pay, support, some of my colleagues, etc.), but that will always be true. One of the main things I like about having a more permanant position is that I feel like I have a vested interest in things (details about my courses, my research, service activities, etc.). I feel better about investing energy in things because it feels a bit more like I'm investing in my own future and the future of my dept, college, etc. When I was in temp positions it just didn't feel the same in that regard. I knew I'd be leaving sooner or later. Also, now that I've been in my TT position for 5.5 years, I have a growing number of students and ex-students who I've helped see through their entire undergrad tenure. And it's really satisfying to be part of that. 3) I haven't been in my position as long as #2, but YES. I love my new gig. I didn't spend too terribly long in a postdoc, but I landed the kind of job I wanted (non-R1 primarily teaching with light research) and I'm very happy. It's nice feeling more in control. Our tenure expectations are crystal clear from go, so I actually feel like I have a say in my future more so than I did on the job market. 4). Yes! I have been an assistant professor at an R1 for 3 years and I love it. I agree with #2 that being invested in a place long-term is a great feeling and really rewarding. Of course the job comes with stress, deadlines, rejections, etc; but I have learned to manage those, and my expectations, and I love going to work every day. 5) OP: Thanks so much for your stories. They make me feel good and excited :) 5) I am not TT but as a non-TT professor at a SLAC on my 3rd year, I too love my job. As with any job there are things I don't like or that I wish were different (The stress is pretty high.) But overall, I am very satisfied. Having a ""light"" research load with low expectations means that I can do the kind of research I want and not what a funding agency wants... Its great... Teaching is fun but can be frustrating when you don't feel like you succeed. I guess that is another negative... Summers are great. Oh, and I never get bored! 6) Several years into a TT gig at an R1. I think there is some truth to the OPs sentiment, things do get busy and stressful. That being said, I would echo what another said about seizing control of your life. Life has more officially ""started"", versus the feeling of being on perpetual hold. On the whole, TT jobs are satisfying when you get one you like, despite what some may (in some cases legitimately) say.  7) I'm in my 5th year a very good SLAC and love it.  Plus, my spouse just landed a TT gig in the same dept, so life is good! 8) The hedonistic treadmill is a more general function of the human condition. It's easy to never be satisfied in life unless one actively works against that feeling. Finding happiness can be made easier by circumstance (such as finding a permanent gig), but the other part of the equation, aside from circumstance, is to have a happiness-centered mindset that acts against the human tendency to always want more and to discount what one has acheived under the notion that it's ""no big deal/not enough.""

I know there's been some discussion of this previously, but what do you all think is the best response when ghosted by the search chair after an on-campus interview, and you've already heard or it's been publicly announced that someone else has been hired? a) just ignore it, b) e-mail the chair asking about the status (without mentioning that you know someone else was hired), or c) e-mail the chair, mentioning that you heard that someone else was hired, and thank them again for the opportunity? 2) Option ""b"" is lying. Otherwise, I don't think it matters.  3) I don't think option b is lying.  It's giving the search chair a chance to come correct and do what they should have done earlier. 4) Is there anything to gain from options b or c? It might feel satisfying to force them to respond (they really should have contacted you beforehand, no question), but I can't think of anything you or they will gain from it. Leaving option a as the clear winner for me. x3  5) I think it probably doesn't matter a whole lot what you do, but I do think option b can have benefits - just sending a friendly, collegial email asking what's up can sort of 'clear the air' so that when you next run into this person things are less awkward. The chair can say 'oh sorry, we picked someone else, but you were great too' and you can say 'oh thanks so much, it was a fun experience nonetheless (even if it wasn't)' and you can both move forward as colleagues, rather than weird ghost-frenemies. x3 6) I wish at least one of the membes of the committee would contact me to let me know it was nice meeting me but I didn't get the position.

(HR is afraid of lawsuits... see the relevant post, from an applicant who feels they were wronged, under venting). So when job candidates have emailed post-interview, asking for feedback or just saying thanks for the interview, I usually don't reply. Ghosting per the rules.  The rules were not written with collegiality in mind, they were written with lawsuits in mind. 11) @10, I think those rules are typical across institutions, but we are mostly talking here about no notification even after the hire has been publicly announced. X2 12) @10, so if the candidate they made an offer to, has accepted and actually started their position and I still have not been notified, is that acceptable? I have no experience being in search committees so I'm just curious 13) Most policies I am aware of explicitly say the chair of the committee or department should contact interviewed candidates after an offer has been accepted. 14) As a chair of a search committee, I can tell you that you are often hamstrung on responding to these request.  HR would only allow me to say ""you are still a top candidate for the possition"" during negotiations.  After negotiations, the official ""hire"" paperwork still too forever and was actually not even official until after the person was here working.  I was not allowed to communicate in any meaningful way with the other candidates until the contract was signed, even after offical announcement the protocol is to just move on.  We are not always being jerks and not communicating information.  Hiring policy often really limits our contact with candidates in (many, many) cases. 15) In my experience, it DOES happen that search committee chairs get annoyed by candidates following up to find out when a decision will be made; in those cases, you have just hit on the fact that the department is run by toxic assholes who make candidates walk on eggshells just so they can be in command. Thus, following up politely to find out the status of the interview *can* hurt you, but it can only hurt you with departments that have a shitty culture where you would be miserable.

I have come accros many of these job ads and it seems that all of them are non ternure track. Is this true? 2) There are exceptions where R1 universities have a separate teaching tenure track, but most rely on fixed-term folks for short-term teaching needs.  Of course, almost all faculty are expected to have some mix of research, teaching & service.  At less research-intensive institutions, the research expectations are lower. 3) like #2 said, non-TT is the norm, but that is changing. Some Unis see the value of a separate TT teaching stream to make sure that they hire good people who are dedicated to teaching, even at big research institutions (i.e. UBC in Canada). 4) I'm at a master's granting institution and there are tenure track folks hired on purely pedagogical lines here  5) Some Universities have an equivalent to tenure for teaching faculty, but HR rules may stop them from calling it tenure track. Sometimes it relates to faculty council rules on P&T, recourse or right to contest under specific scenarios.   Email the chair to ask if it's a long term position or not whenever you can. X) Thank you all for your responses - they are very helpful! 6) IN the University of California, there is the ""LPSOE"" -- Lecturer with Potential for Security Of Employment""-- after a few years the position turns into LSOE (Lecturer with secutrity of employment).  So we don't call it tenure, but... "
NA,"""internal candidates"" What does it mean when a SLAC is noted as having ""internal candidates""? Are these alumni? (1) Generally means that (as rumored) the university has someone they want to hire (spousal accommodation, research associate converting to TT) but has to go through the process of posting the position.  I will note that at least one case like this I know about (adjunct faculty ""converting"" to TT) the position did go to one of the outside applicants.  (2)  There is a difference between the two cases above.  In a spousal hire, the position is usually created for the candidate, and, as a rule, nobody else is actually invited for an interview.  In the case of an an employee (post-doc, lecturer) applying for the job, that candidate has just as many disadvantages as advantages in the search process. (3) Some universities require that the department go through a search process even if it is a spousal hire.  This has happened at two universities I have been at (they posted the job and had to bring in at least one other candidate to interview in order to meet hiring standards for the university). The department had no intention of hiring anyone but the spousal hire.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"University of Nevada, Reno internal candidate Candidates should have expertise in state-of-the-art methods for quantifying and modeling the demographics and dynamics of vertebrate populations. The ideal candidate will have a strong and demonstrated commitment to research on avian systems, but will be able and willing to apply their expertise to other vertebrate groups. 2) I think there's an internal candidate for this position. 3) I personally know a member of the search committee and do not believe that is true, I'll see if I can get him to write in. 4) There's a post-doc that at UNR that works on quantitative ecology of birds. 5) In response to this thread, the chair of the search wrote: ""Thanks for the heads up! The job is totally open."" 6) That UNR post doc is actually the search chair's post-doc 7) Smells like nepotism to me. 8)  Not nepotism at all...the search is to fill a long-held position in the department on the population biology of birds.  9) Who gives a shit if there is an internal candidate. 10) People who spend a lot of time tailoring their application to a job to find out its been all for naught because the interview process was just for show. 11) And go to an interview, nail it, and still have the job go to a less qualified internal hire...so it does matter to a lot of folks if there is already a candidate in mind, still apply but it helps moderate expectations. 12) There are post-docs that 'work on quantitative ecology of birds' at every single instituion in the country.... 13) This does seem like it could be a fixed search. You can't just ask the search chair to confirm/deny these things. Legally they're required to pretend the search is open and objective, especially in writing such as an email. On the other hand, it would be really dumb for the department to go along with giving the job to an existing post-doc. Inbreeding in departments is never a good sign, and it would shift the balance of power in the department towards the advisor + former post-doc. I'm sure there are plenty of people in the department that would resist that sort of internal hire. We're not talking about a ""two-body problem"" here, involving trying to keep a star faculty member from leaving, which is a totally different scenario. 14) I am fully aware of the search committee and circumstances of this position, I have zero sense that this is a fixed position, and nor does it read like one. In fact, its nearly identical to the positions being advertised at Utah State. If you don't believe me, don't apply. 15) Maybe there should be a conjecture and rumor column  16) I agree, the situation is less than ideal for an external candidate  17) This is honestly really confusing me.  Could someone explain why they think it’s fixed, or “smells like nepotism” or is “less than ideal” for external candidates?  Because the search chair has a postdoc who worked on bird demography once?  So any search where the chair (or any committee member?) had a postdoc (current or past?) who could fit the description is unfair? 18) Just another person with connections to this hiring committee - they also say no internal candidate. Luckily, no one is making you apply so if you are that concerned about it, simply dont.  You probably dont want to work in a department full of people you suspect may be so deceptive, right? 19) There are no legitimate searches.  Every job is already filled before it is even advertised.  All of this is for show.  You will never get a job and should never bother applying.  Signed, Internal Candidate. 20) LOL ",NA,"Long time window for interviews I will have an on campus interview in the third week of January.  However, the Department has already interviewed the first candidate (out of 6) this week.  I will be the last one and I am a bit concerned that since they are already interviewing now, by the time I will have my interview (3.5 months from the first one!) the Department will have already made an implicit decision.  What is your opinion? 2) Will it be painful for you to go? As long as it isn't a strain on your personal life/research program, worst-case would be an ""invited seminar"" at a department that you think is interesting, right? 3) OP here: No of course it wouldn't be painful and I will go.  I am probably just overthinking here... 4) Some people say the last slot is the most ideal slot, it's easier to stand out if they already know what the range of quality / ability is. x3 5) Experienced search committee member here. Congratulations on your interview. Don't worry about the order in which candidates are interviewed. It doesn't affect anything. x2 6) If they're waiting for you I would take that as a good sign! x2 6) OP again: Thanks you'll!  7) don't over think it!  #5 is wrong, order does matter, especially with a 3-month window, but how it matters are unpredictable from search to search, can either help or hurt. Nothing you can do about it, so try to only think about how you'll go in and show how awesome you'd be if they hired you. 8) I didn't know that ""#5 is wrong"" and ""my experience differs from #5's"" were synonyms... X4 9) I am not aware of any literature on how interview order affects/does not affect probability of getting hired. So we're all speculating here, unless someone can produce data. #5's hypothesis is seasoned by experience but still requires empirical verification. My belief, also as a seasoned search committee member, is that the last person to interview over such a long span is in the best pole position. Humans have imperfect memories that become more and more confounded/reconstructed/distorted through time. The last interviewee would therefore be the freshest impression in the minds of the department when they meet. Memories of the other candidates may become vague or distorted over such a long time period. Of course we want to believe that search committees are equally fair to all candidates, and of course they strive to be so. But humans brains are fallable, and memories are especially so, so unconscious slants to the process, such as interviewee order, can slip in. Other aspects of ordering play a vast role in behavior (see the literature on the effect of birth order on personality). Why do we assume human neurological biases and idiosyncracies play no role when it comes to interview order and hiring decisions? I would hytpothesize, therefore, that interview order does play a role. My two cents.",NA,"Aesthetic suggestion for 'Appointment' column Why not just keep the appointment tab to ""TT"" or ""Tenure Track"" rather than ""Tenure-track/tenured""? Seems nedlessly long and forces each row to be two lines. 2) Yeah I thought about that. Some sticklers have said ""Tenure Track"" means on the road to tenure, so not appropriate for assoc/full profs, so I thought I'd accomodate that.  What do y'all think?  I also considered ""Tenure Stream"" which covers both, but maybe not as widely recognized.  AP 3) I think just TT is fine. Already-tenured folks are smart enough to see that it's open rank. 4) I would suggest changing it to something like ""TT or equivalent"". That would also cover universities and countries that don't use a tenure system. 5) OK what do y'all think of that? AP 6) I think ""TT / Permanent"" and ""Fixed term"" is the main distinction. The information under Rank offers more detail."
NA,"Pittsburgh Has anyone heard anything back from them?  1) Nope, I sent a followup email yesterday (12/9) with no response yet (2) I received snail mail confirmation that they received my application a couple of weeks ago- nothing else",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Places you'd want to live Just curious for people who submit tons of apps in a hiring year (>15? >20?). Are you really excited about living in the places where all of those institutions are located, or are you just looking for any employment? Also, do you apply to places in sub-optimal locations hoping you'll move elsewhere after a couple of years? Interested in what drives people... not trying to be judgy. 2) I did not apply places that I absolutely dislike. But if it's in a city that I am not excited but the job is a fine opportunity, I applied.  C'est la vie. 3) I've never liked the location of any place I have applied. This is what I hate most about academia. Since I hit the market, a job fitting my research description has never been offered at a place that I would want to live (I have very specific geographic desires). So waiting for a ""perfect"" location versus taking a job at a ""shit"" location is a double-edged sword. If you don't take a ""shit"" location, a better location might not come along. If you take a ""shit"" location, you might end up getting tenure there and have a harder time moving when the ""perfect"" location finally offers a job that you are qualifed for.  4) Yeah, the locations of most schools I've applied to (especially this year, so far...) seem pretty dismal and I'm increasingly becoming open to greener pastures abroad. 5) I hardly think >15-20 is tons of apps!! I have friends who have applied to 60-80 in a single year; of course that is really stretching to apply to everything possible. Still, the best correlate of job offers is number of applications and unless you are a superstar applying very selectively is a hard way to get a job, I think. I'm also in a specialty where there are only ~2-6 jobs a year that are really in my field in the whole country, but I can span general ecology to general evolution, so that opens up a lot of jobs that are various degrees of a stretch in terms of fit. Getting back around to your question: yes I have applied to lots of places where I am not excited about living though there are a few places that are too undesirable for me to even try. I also balance location and desirability of the job, so I'll apply for a not so great job in a place I'd really like to live (or a job that is a stretch for my research) and I'll apply for a great job in a place I don't really want to live, but if it is just a so-so job and a not great location I'll probably pass. 6) I'll take what I can get. There are places I would really like to live, but I also know that many of the schools in those places are full of politics, drama and arent a great work environment. There are also places I really don't want to live (I'm unreasonably scared of tornados....). So, Im applying everywhere and just seeing if anything sticks. 7) Following up on 5's tangent about correlates of offers, the data (at least in this self-reported group) don't really bear that out. 8) ya I agree with 5 and 7, the whole correlation with number of applications and success seems to work in a few cases, notably the very public ones that have been blogged/written about! But there are lots of examples of people being successful with a much more targetted approach - which could be based on where you want to live 9) A bunch of people on the anon quals page this year seem to have put in search results from last year and the whole thing is kind of a jumble (not that it was ever that useful). In other years jobs applied was a good predictor. Of course there are all kinds of caveats about those data in the first place. https://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2017/01/04/you-cant-tell-much-about-your-odds-of-getting-an-interview-for-a-faculty-position-from-common-quantitative-metrics/ 10) In other words, those results are likely spurious. 11) Just my two cents worth. I applied for around 50 jobs last year and got one offer. That offer wasn't what I expect, not a department that I fit in nicely and not a city that I expect to move to. I did not get even get on the shortlists of some applications that I expected/hoped that I would, but finally I got an interview at a place which I did not expect would give me an interview, much less the final offer. After settling into the job, I found that I really enjoyed my work here and my colleagues are really awesome to me. I find myself setting up unexpected collaborations and new projects which I never thought I would be interested in. So what I want to say is, just apply for anything suitable and maybe you get something that you will never expect to get. Life is like a box of chocolates. 12) I applied for 43 jobs last year - 28  R1s, 7 R2s and and 8 SLACs. I ended up with 3 R1 interviews, 1 R2 interview and 1 SLAC interview and got 1 job offer at an R1. The SLAC and R2 were in very desirable locations but were much worse jobs than any of the R1 jobs. 1 of the R1s was in an amazing spot (did not get that job, alas), and the other two were in locations that some folks might find bleak. I'm still negotiating with the job to see if we can make a spousal situation happen and will apply again for jobs this year in case it doesn't. Like some of the posters above, I am only going to apply for SLAC and R2 jobs that are in amazing locations. And I would most definitely take an R1 job in a sub-optimal location. The difference between an R1 and even an R2 job in terms of start-up, teaching load, and other kinds of resources is huge, and it is very difficult (although not impossible) to transition between R2s/SLACs and R1s. It is less difficult to transition between R1s if you are kicking ass. ",NA,"Drug screening for postdocs?

I bet a lot of universities drug test facility staff because some work with heavy machinery. If post-docs at those institutions are coded in the same staff directory, I could see drug tests being mandatory. 6) I took a drug test (post-doc).

NA,"Vasser Probably related to the previous - but where did you hear that there are four internal candidates?  Looking through their website, they have a single non non-TT faculty, and no postdocs, so where would these be drawn from? (1)  Were was this posted that this was an inside hire?  I was really interested in the job too.... oh well. (2) Generally it's best to ignore rumors like this. I'm still applying. (3) I do as well, and these rumors pop up everywhere, but a rumor of FOUR internal candidates is strange.  (4) I heard there are 400 inside candidates for one position, its the one I want to get.  (5) Nah, there are at least 4,000  candidates. (6)  Well, I got phone calls from 4 different individuals who told me that they were inside candidates and that I better not apply, or else...BTW, the online application program at Vassar asks you if you're a Vassar Alumnus, and where you got your PhD from.  Most ask if you're an employee are were an employee, this is the first time I've been asked if I studied there.  I would guess that here is where being from any Ivy-league school becomes an advantage... (7) My guess is that the four people you talked to are full of sh*&. They just don't want the competition applying so they can have this to themselves. (8) Oh that's funny, they called me too and told me to apply so they would look better in comparison. (9) I would laugh more at (8)'s response if it weren't so true for me.  I cry when I look at the anon quals page ;) (10) I hear ya #9, don't cry. I look at the anon quals page as a glass half full. The bigshots on there will undoubtedly get the jobs I applied to (Kudos!) and I can only hope that they will also get enough money from their start-ups to hire me as a post doc. ;-p  (11)  don't cry about quali page.  Everyone has something to sell, and what is good at one school can be really bad at another. (12) I doubt that a couple of Science or Nature papers, 250K- 1million $ grants, and independent teaching exp. under your belt can hurt your chances or ""be really bad"" at any school. Boo hoo hoo hoo!. (13)  True, except that, for an RU, independent teaching experience will not increase your chances, though I'm sure that big grants and big pubs would help you in an application for a primarily teaching institute...",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Spouse during campus interview Do you take your spouse when you go to a campus interview? You know, so that the partner can see the place and all that, and to have someone to talk to at the end of the day. Or do you think that it complicates things even further? 2) I think it's a bad idea. Better to bring them for a visit after an offer is made. x2 3) I've never heard of anyone doing that except in cases where the spouse is helping take care of an infant or for some other very good reason (i.e., not just to see the place). Definitely better to go back for a visit after an offer is made. 4) I've seen it happen while on a search committee. No one cared. I'd notify the search committee of your intentions to bring your spouse a priori so it's not a surprise when checking into hotels or pick-up at airports. Be cognizant that this could alter your reimbursement; i.e., in some states, if only one person is being provided a hotel room by the state, the reimbursement for a double occupancy hotel room will be halved.   5) I have seen two applicants for one search each bring their spouse. No one on the hiring committee cared. 6) Ive only seen it once, but it was the husband of a candidate that had a very, very young child that was breastfeeding, so he came along to help with childcare.  7) If you do, under no circumstances do you want your spouse at the interview influencing your chances of being hired.  7) That would seem really presumptuous where I'm at (an R1). Right now, we want to know if we want you. If you become the top of our list (i.e. we make an offer), we fly your whole family out and treat you all nice, because now the ball is in your court. 8) I'm about to bring my spouse and young (but not very young) child to an interview.  Why not?  I think it's likely they'd fly us out for a return visit if an offer was made, but that seems like a lot of extra work to go twice, and honestly if it's going to cause a problem to have them there, it's not a school I want to be at anyway.  And this way I'll feel more solid in my decision on an offer if I get one.  But I'll post back here if it turns out to be a terrible idea. 9) I've participated in SCs where the candidates brought their spouses. One was a woman who was breastfeeding and needed help with child care. Another was a man. His wife got a tour of town/real estate while he was in interviews. It really depends on the departments policy on spousal accomodation. Legally SCs aren't allowed to consider your marital status, so it is OK to ask if you can bring a spouse. Having said that, I'm not sure what I'm going to do for my first on-campus interview next month.",NA,"Interview advice (skype or in-person) I just want to give you all general interview advice (skype or in-person) -- this is motivated by the thread below. If you get an interview, please, please, prepare for it. If you're not told, you can ask who is on the search committee, and you should look up all of their research. If you get an on-campus interview, you should look up the webpage of every person you will meet with. You should try to find some reseach connection with every one (this can be a stretch, its okay, it makes it seem like you're curious, and interesting, and will be able to have good conversations with all of your colleagues). This is what the elusive *fit* is all about. If you want the offer (I don't see why you wouldn't) you should also make it seem like this is your dream job, this is where you want to be, and have *reasons* for why this is your dream job. These should be specific (not, it seems like a great place). Related to the question below about your research in the next 20 years. This is not actually such an odd-ball question. You should have a vision for your research (especially if you're applying/interviewing at R1s). Of course you won't know what your greatest achievement will be, but you should be able to say what your dream research looks like (just like you probably have a dream vision for what other aspects of your life will look like).  I know the job market is tough, and tight, and a huge part of being the chosen applicant is being prepared and enthusiastic and coming across as being a great future colleague. 2) OP, I think you are 100% right, but I can't help thinking that successfully pulling off what you describe is so so much easier for extroverts than for introverts and doesn't necessarily have much to do with how an applicant will actually perform in the job. I know it isn't going to change anytime soon so we have to deal with it, but it can feel more like a popularity contest than an evaluation of your work or suitability for a position. 3) How is this advice new, it's on every generic job blog. This feels more like a sc member demeaning than uplifting prospective candidates x5 4)  No one who is interviewing knows what the departmental constraints are, which are what really determine output in a 20 year period. Do SC want to hear what interviewees think their departmental constraints are? Not likely  5) I don't get the negativity of the previous 2 comment. The OP had a different take, mostly on the 20yr question. The OP's take on it was reasonable. No one cares about ""Departamental constraints"" when they are hiring. Most likely the question itself is a different version of the more popular question ""What are your long-term goals?"". Again, I don't see an issue with the question althought I admit it's weirdly phrased... OP: Thanks for your contribution! 6) Nah 7) #7 from post below. The point that I appreciate from the OP here is that you should come sufficiently prepared that you *can* answer the 20yr question with something reasonable and enthusiastic, although it's a really weird way to phrase a question about long-term research program goals. I don't blame #4 for being thrown off by that phrasing at all. As scientists, we are often highly detail-focused. The trick to this question is probably not to take it too literally, and instead launch into a summary of where your program is going (something that you hopefully have already thought about) 8) This is 4 here: sorry for the negativity, but it comes from the fact that most academics love their jobs because despite all the hardships, they can usually avoid corporate awfulness. Asking about long-term goals is perfectly reasonable: asking someone what they think they could achieve at their own institution is a pretty meaningless question that is just asking for a bullshit response and often will get people to say something stupid which is not feasible because there is no infrastructure or support to achieve any of it. Personally, I would love to install a Hadron Collider by the end of my 20 year tenure at your liberal arts college. X3 9) Agreed. It's just more ridiculous bs that can be gotten away with in this exploitative job market. 10) The saddest part is, these professors don't even realize they are a large part of the problem. 11) Hey all, I just wanted to give you some advice for interviews. You should prepare for interviews. Also, when I say prepared, I mean every question possible. 12) Prepared like knowing what your future plans are. Be able to say what questions most interest you and why should they interest me. And know something about the faculty in the department. If you can't take ~2 hours to look at everybody's web page or publication record, then maybe you aren't going to be real motivated in the future to prepare good lectures, manuscripts, or grant proposals. 13) yeah everyone, you should prepare for interviews, just my $0.02. 14) Thanks guys! Before I read this I just went in to interviews with my mouth open and looked at the committee with no preparation. This thread has blown my mind and I will now prepare for interviews. 15) @14, don't forget to prepare. Don't go in there not prepared. 16) Something else that isn't so obvious is to limit your smoking breaks. I've found that my interviews go better when I don't take smoke breaks all the time and don't smoke in the offices of my interviewers. If you've had trouble getting the offer, this might be something to consider. 17) why is this not in the venting tab...or should we start a sarcasm tab? 18) @17, this is an important discussion. Apparently, not sucking up to SCs and the wonders of their careers is bad. You can't possibly be the right ""fit"" for a university without knowing the birthday of every person you meet in a department. You should also know their career highlights. If not, you are considered ill-prepared and someone will write another post about how ill-prepared candidates are these days. So, what we are trying to solve here is decreasing the number of asinine posts so that we can have more fruitful discussions in the future. This is easily accomplished by being sarcastic assholes. PS, I am ultimately happy that someone told the truth about job interview prepration...it's not how good you are, it's how good you make the SC members feel about themselves. 19) #12 here. Spin it however makes you feel good. But people do show up to interviews with no apparent knowledge of things like who else is an ecologist in the department, who might have similar research interests and skills, or what biological systems people work on. Seems obvious to investigate who the faculty are, but I'd say roughly 1/3 of interviewees don't or they hide their preparation very well. Call it sucking it up if you want. 20) We had a candidate who came for an on-campus interview who could not name a single faculty member when asked who they could possibly collaborate in the Dept. On the other hand, we had another candidate who presented at least three possible collaborations with current faculty members and possible collaborative projects when they presented their research seminar. Guess who was chosen? 21) Always good to pad the egos, even though at most schools smaller than R1s, very little collaboration ever occurs between faculty because the faculty all do dynamically different stuff. Unfortunately, all faculty came from R1s at one point and for some reason ""ability to collaborate"" is still considered some big bean in applying for jobs. I'm a full prof...seen people come and go...have only ever collaborated with one other faculty member, and it was one that no one would have guessed coming in. In my opinion, ability to collaborate should not be a huge buying point for any candidate.  22) OP here. I get the bitterness and sarcasm, I really do, and its fine. But this isn't about the ego of search committee members, this isn't even about forced collaborations. This is about being prepared to talk about *your* long-term goals, and being able to make interesting and informed conversation with your potential colleagues. Also, by knowing the research of the search committee members, it gives *you* a much better sense of the sub-text of what the department is looking for (all those people are on the search committee for a reason, usually because they have some kind of vested interest in who is selected). This is about you being the best candidate you can be. So scoff if you want, but don't be the person that shows up unprepared. 23) Maybe your shortlist selection process needs help 24) haha, @23: Yeah, we liked your CV, the phone interview went great, we thought you were good enough for the job based on your past performance, but you just didn't titillate us enough during your interview. Thus, we deem you unqualified and hired someone who was less qualified but really could be a great friend that fosters our egos. Thanks for trying. 25) What happened to you 24? 24 again) Nothing much. Just after 10 years of being on search committees I've discovered that faculty are unqualified to hire their co-workers.  26) That’s fair 27) Oh, FFS #24, if you've been on search committees for 10 years you know that by the time candidates get to interview stage they are all equally qualified, and have equally fantastic CVs and research statements, etc. This isn't about hiring someone unqualified! 28) I didn't say unqualified. I said less qualified. It's a popularity contest when candidates get on campus. From my experience, the candidates that are most qualified on paper often times don't get hired b/c they just weren't the ""right type of person"" once they got on campus. The elusive ""fit"" issue, which is completely bogus. When you get a faculty job, you are working for the university, not the faculty. So why should faculty have so much say in who gets hired? I think faculty should be involved in vetting candidates to confirm qualifications and that's it. What tends to happen is that a clique in a department will all vote together on faculty hires and pretty much drive who gets hired. And if you don't mesh well with that clique on your campus interview, you are screwed. Granted, this is my experience from liberal arts colleges and regional campuses. I have no experience with R1 institutes. 29) If faculty had ""less say in who gets hired"", who is going to make the decision? Deanlets, the Dept Chair, ratemyprofessor? I've been through about 10 faculty searches and have never seen a clique that lasts between searches (I have seen unification around certain decisions), but maybe they haven't invited me into their secret society. 30). Yeah, I agree with 29. Never seen this clique that 28 speaks of. But I'm at an R1, where I think 'research fit' is really important in building strong departments. I agree with 27, everyone arrives for interviews very 'qualified', so its almost never about choosing the most 'qualified' at that point.",NA, 
NA,"Advice Anyone have any advice on how to approach applying two jobs at the same university (especially if in the same department)?  In one case, I just asked to be considered for two jobs (since in the same department).  In another case, I wrote two applications geared toward each job (in this case, actually in different colleges).  I have the same issue coming up again (same department this time). Send in one application? (1) I suggest writing the search chair(s) and asking what they prefer. If you do send in two applications, it's probably a good idea to mention that you're applying to both.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Current colleagues as refs How important is it to have colleagues in your current department serve as a reference? I'm sure it depends on if you've been there <1 yr vs > 5, but just wondering. One might want to ensure the department to which they're applying sees that the person can form collegial relationships with current colleagues, but then maybe they don't want their colleagues knowing they're on the market. Thoughts?  2) I have been on two hiring committees.  I never really cared what insitute the person writing a letter of reference was at.  If he/she was your PhD supervisor from six years ago and they said that you were hot shit, and you've had a good publishing record since you finished your PhD that shows that you're hot shit, that's fine, I think.  The oddest case I've seen was a prof who was on the market who had all of his letters of reference written by people he'd supervised like postdocs and former grad students.  He was older, so I suppose it would have been awkward/impossible for him to get a letter of reference from his former supervisor, but yes, that situation where he couldn't get a single letter from a colleague or anyone established (not even a longtime friend/collaborator???) was a major red flag.  Personally though, I would feel tremendously awkward about asking a departmental colleague to write me a letter of reference to work elsewhere. 3) I have sat on many search committees and here is my response: people actually read those letters? I could care less what people say about a candidate. 4) It's pretty typical for academics to move around thoughout their careers, so I wouldn't see it as an awkward thing to ask of friendly colleagues. There are millions of reasons besides a sh*tty atmosphere why one might choose to relocate. 5) I'm happy at my current institution, but applied for a fancy job.  I asked the most prestgious senior colleague in my department to write a letter; his letter could speak to how I was as a colleague. The request was slightly awkward, but most of us know this is how the game is played. 6) #3, I've heard several senior people express your sentiment about letters, but I've also had senior people who have served on many committees tell me that the letters are the deciding factor in most of their hiring decisions...hard to know from one committee to the next, I guess.7) #3 I have gone to several interviews where specific lines from my letters have been brought up by the committee..so clearly someone was reading (and it gives me a peek into what my references are saying about me!) 8) #3 again...Eh, I'd rather judge a candidate from my own perspective than take the word of their friend. I've always just considered letters of recommendation a formality; i.e., ""We better ask for letters just to make sure this person has at least three people they get along with before we waste money bringing them in for an interview."" 9) #3 I think there are very different styles of evaluating an application.  I read (skim) the letters, and I don't read the research/teaching/diversity statement all the way through, even of candidates that make the short list!  That's what the CV is for. 10) #3, again...of course, everyone is different. My first response was partially sarcastic. I do know people who read every word from every letter of the phone interviewees' letters. The majority of committee members are probably somewhere in the middle of the extremes. ",NA,"Skpe/Zoom Interview prep There's a couple of interview prep comments here and there but Ithought of starting specifically on the topic of what to expect for the very first interview, which is the skype interview stage. Seems like its 30 min to hour max probably but what do hiring committees looking for at this stage? And whats the experience people had? 2) 30 min was standard for me (or shorter). Seriously the best advice I got was knowing the kinds of questions committees typically ask, and come prepared to answer. I literally wrote out answers to questions beforehand. Sometimes this stage is just to make sure you're not a weirdo, and other times it really is to get a better sense of whose research fits best. 3) Agreed with #2 -- there are ~5-6 general types of questions you can expect to be asked (chat with some faculty/postdocs to see what the questions will likely be). And congrats on the skype interview! Here is a pretty helpful guide: https://mcewanlab.org/2016/01/26/six-basic-tips-for-a-winning-phone-interview/ 4) agree with #2 and #3, great link! Also re: application gaffes #13, be sure to turn on your computer's camera and look at the shot, be sure to remove anything weird in the background and that it's pointed at your face! Writing out answers to questions is great, they will almost all ask some version of the following things: i) why do you want to be here? ii) explain your research/research needs/plans for obtaining funding iii) what courses could you help teach and which new courses would you develop, iv) what would you do to support diversity as faculty here, v) what questions do you have for us.  vi) A question I got in my first skype interview that killed me was: WHAT WAS YOUR GREATEST ACHIEVMENT IN SCIENCE, AND WHICH WILL BE YOUR GREATEST ACHIEVEMENT IN THE NEXT 20 YEARS? 6) that is tough, especially when they yell it at you (just kidding, it is a tough question). 7) Seriously? Predict the outcomes of your research program in the next 20 years? I'd struggle not to laugh before trying to answer that question. 8) #6 again here.  And indeed I had serious issues answering that questiona and this affected the all interview because I felt I screwed up.  And indeed I was not invited on campus!  9) Enthusiasm is important.  A friend was asked if they really want to be there.  They said, ""I'm not sure yet.""  They did not get an in person interview. 10) Also great advice: https://theprofessorisin.com/2011/10/31/thephoneorskypeinterview/",NA,

Many of the jobs posted here are not R1 schools focused on research. The number of publications, etc., does not play as large of a role in terms of qualifications at such institutions. In fact, having served on a search committee at a small, Midwestern institution, we were often turned off by candidates who had a lot of high-profile publications - they might not be a good fit, and they might only be applying for this job to get a pay check until a better one comes along. I could imagine columns such as ""# years teaching experience"" or ""# courses taught"" could be valuable. 2) Sure, why not add them.  3) # of courses taught is already on there. 4) Hey OP - You guys should really watch the movie ""She's Out of My League"" - as someone with high quality publications who might not want an R1 job, I encourage you to give people with good research CVs a chance",NA,"open rank positions  Of those of you who have served in search committees, do you care how long research statements are?

What are search committees looking for here? I.e. is it better to include a high impact paper where you are not first author? 2) I would advise going with the highest impact no matter what the author order. 3) Disagree - if given a choice of a single paper, a middle-author CNS paper will not be as valuable as a first author paper in any decent journal. x4 4) Look at your pubs. What first authors pubs do you think are most significant and representative of your work? Sit back and hope that a committee thinks they are great. 5) Agree with #3 ...I would go with 1st authors in good journals over great journal as a middle author 6) Agree with first author pubs; But also, consider which pubs best fit vis a vis job ad.

If you are applying for your first faculty job, it does not matter how old the pub is, if it's a good pub and you're first author.

",NA,"Transcripts I am wondering the purpose of attaching transcripts with an application package. Is this to confirm the applicant actually went to the schools they list on their application, or is it further to assess how well they did? I ask because my undergraduate performance was less than stellar (much less, actually), but I managed to overcome this and have actually done quite well for myself since (in my second year of a postdoc, publishing, and teaching). I wish I could tell my 20-year-old self to get a grip, but I can't. Thoughts? 2) Yeah, F those places. 3) when they are used, they are largely to assess the type of coursework you had in order to make some assessment about what you might be able to teach and your general training that can't be gleaned from your research. I don't think there is much assessment of ""performance"". 4) @OP I'm in the same boat as you. My undergrad was underwhelming but aced my grad school courses. My former department head at an R1 school known for ecology told me they had a few classes that they did poorly in (I don't want to give specifics, but they were standard courses). It was really helpful for me as an undergrad to hear that (normalized my experience). I'd hope you (I will) and others here would use their experiences like that to normalize undergraduate struggles and let students know it isn't all over if you get a poor grade in a class. As for what each individual school does with transcripts... I thought it was mostly an HR box checking thing, but I see where @3 is coming from. 5) OP here, thank you all for your input - this definitely makes me feel better. I often tell panicked students with poor grades that they can still be successful and there is always time to turn things around. I was just hoping that was *actually* true. :) 6) I was a raft guide in undergrad, and spent more time on the river than in class. I earned less-than-stellar grades in undergrad, but got a job offer last year after a school saw my ug transcript. You rock.  7) Sounds like an HR requirement.   8) This is typically for accreditation - schools need to prove that X% of faculty hold a terminal degree.  No sense in considering an applicant who can't prove they actually hold a terminal degree, though this is sometimes not sussed out until an offer is on the table or until a hire is made.  I actually learned well after I was hired for a TT job that one of my transcripts hadn't been received by the school that hired me.  I have *never* heard of grades (or coursework) being considered as part of an application package, except to the extent that an applicant discusses their training in terms of what they'd like to teach.

I want to know how the department may be interfacing with school-wide initiatives, but realize that the question may put the interviewer on the defensive.  1) Depends on the context and how you frame it. If you have some good ideas about how to retain minority and first generation students, and if you are interviewing at a PUI, this may start a very nice and productive conversation which the interviewers may see you as someone who really understands the situation. 2) X2 - this sounds like a great question for the end of the interview that they likely won't have asked about and shows you're thinking about larger issues. 2 caveats - first, as #1 suggests, make sure you have some idea or context to back up your interest and, second, be aware that it could indeed put them on the defensive if they don't have anything similar and could backfire somewhat. I'm stealing this. 3) I think that the question is appropriate. I'd be interested to hear the replies. If you are looking for a question that could easily be answered by the SCs, this might not be the best choice. I don't think they will get defensvie, but I'm betting that very few have any idea what their university is doing. Most profs live in a bubble in their building. 4) It's a good question and displays that you're thinking about how to be part of the university. Many faculty do serve on university-wide committess (or have administrative friends, spouses, and neighbors) and actually do have decent knowledge of programs and proposals at their universities. 5) This is in general a very good question, but it can turn into a relatively bad one if the University's website already has plenty of information about it that you could have easily found.

I really don't mean this as a question about the validity or politics of diversity hires, but rather a genuine question about whether I should even bother looking at those jobs at all (I'm a white male). It isn't clear to me whether language like that is intended to increase the diversity of the applicant pool only (at which point the search will then proceed normally) or whether diversity will/can be made an explicit consideration in ranking the applications. Basically what I want to know is should I just save myself the time of filling out that application? 2) I won't be applying to this one (nor the UC Berkeley cluster hire). Both seem to pretty explicitly state a preference for underrepresented groups, and I can't imagine them going with a white dude based on the current demographics of the department. 3) OP: Yes, I was thinking the same thing about those two, but some others seem more borderline in terms of how the preferences are worded. I guess it isn't legal to say this in some cases, but I wish that for the sake of saving everyone time they could just say explicitly if there is no chance of consideration. 4) It is legal to consider race-ethnicity in hiring, but it cannot be the only factor (Fischer v. UT Austin, Gratz v. Bollinger, Grutter v. Bollinger, UC v. Bakke are some of the most recent precedents). It is more murky for sex-gender (Johnson v. Transportation Agency and Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins are somewhat in conflict). In any case, race-ethnicity-sex-gender can be a criterion in selection, but it cannot be the 'explicit consideration.' Also, I would suppose that fewer people would apply for a job ad like that, so your chances of making the short list could potentially be higher. Just a thought. 5) @4, the cases you cite are all about admissions not employment. I'm not a lawyer, but that seems like a relevant distinction. 6) Precedent in employment and education are the same, affirmative action rulings in admissions are used as precedent for employment. It is the same for the upcoming trial of Students for Fair Admission (SFA) v. Harvard. If the case ends up at SCOTUS and the court rules for SFA, it could be the beginning of the end of affirmative action in admissions and employment. In truth, the history of the American Civil Rights Movement was centered around education - e.g. Brown v. Board of Ed. (school segregation) overturned Plessy v. Ferguson (segregation of all public facilities; actually, the original case focused on whether a mixed-race person could ride in a particular railway car - but after the case ruled against the plaintiff, the precedent was the main justification for all of the racism and segregation that ocurred in the south until Brown v. Board and the Civil Rights Act) - so, while it may seem to someone who is not familiar with the law, that the precedents like Grutter v. Bollinger or Brown v. Board deal only with education, the outcomes apply broadly to to most sectors of society. Partially, because a large portion of precedent deals with the 'underlying principles' of law, rather than focusing on specific situations or sectors, i.e. employment vs. admissions vs. access to a drinking fountain. Hope that helps. 7) Thanks 4, that is helpful. How does the law differ for things like postdoctoral fellowships and 'future faculty' diversity initiatives? It seems that some of those programs are worded in such a way that it is more explicit that they will only consider candidates with backgrounds that meet diversity criteria. Is the law different in those cases? 8) For what it is worth, my own university (R1) had a cluster hire several years ago targeted to increase faculty racial diversity. Of the multiple faculty hired, one was a white male, so yes, it may be worth applying. 9) As far as diversity hires, let me just say that I totally and whole-heartedly support them. And now that I've prefaced it in that way I'm sure you are awaiting some ignorant comment... I really hope that isn't the case (I'm willing to learn if I didn't consider something), but here it goes. For all but one application I've put in this year (I've applied for ~30) the diversity questionaires have asked about various combinations of race, ethnicity, sex, gender, veteran status, and ""disabilities"" (as they state it, not trying to be ableist). The one application did ask for several of these criteria (of course, it's required by law), but... only one (a SLC) asked whether I was a first generation student (I am). I am by most other definitions in priviledged groups (white, male, cis-gender, straight, middle class), but I do feel like I bring something to departments and for students in that regard. Would it be acceptable to apply for a diversity hire on those grounds or is that not a generally accepted area of diversity from administrators that will eventually decide if the criteria of the search are met (I get that within a department the consideration may be different than what the dean or school may consider). 10) You are referring to voluntary self-identification forms. Those are used to report to the EEOC and they will never be seen by the search committee. Also, you don't have to answer those questions. 9) @10, yes, I understand that and perhaps I worded things poorly. I really meant (in short form): is first-gen considered a source of diversity in hires and should I be more explicity in applications that I am a first-gen student? 11) First generation US citizen from an under-represented group, yes. First in your family to go to college? I would say no. Most folks I know are first to undergrad, first to grad school or some combination. If that is in the minority at a state school, it's news to me. Likewise, while you may not have started undergrad with the same prep, outwardly cis/white first gen college students are not systematically repressed lin the same ways as visible minorities. 9) @11, thanks for the response. I think that is how I was leaning, but I had been told otherwise and it didn't really feel quite right. I didn't want to bias an answer one way or another so I was trying to strike a neutral tone. As far as the marjority/minority of faculty being first-gen or not, I'm not sure. But anectotally, at my current R1 first gen is a minority in the faculty and grad student body. I don't want to use that as a blanket assumption across the board, but it would be interesting to see what a normal distribution is (especially past generation of faculty versus current applicants). And no, that was not an intential pun. 12) Just to complicate things a little further, you can be cis/male white and Hispanic. That's my case. Sometimes I feel weird claiming that I am Hispanic in this type of situations.13) I think we need to be honest with ourselves. I'm a hispanic WOC but I didn't grow up in the US, thus I didn't experience what hispanic WOC experience while growing up in the USA (e.g. systemic segregation in school districts). In my applications, I don't use the ""minority card"" because I don't feel that's my personal experience. That being said, I do have a cultural connection with hispanic and other POC students and I've done a lot of outreach with underserved communities while in the USA so this is what I use in my diversity statement and how I present myself as a ""diversity applicant"". I focus on the outreach and activities I've done to promte inclusivness and not so much on the fact that I'm a WOC.    14) What if you identify as a different race than you are? 15) Does anyone have a sense whether being LGBT+ would be seen as a diversity hire? I'm guessing this varies widely by specific school or department 16) @ 15, I absolutely think LGBT+ is a diversity hire. I may be biased, but that's because I am LGBT+ and know that those who identify on that spectrum are less likely that heteronormative peers to graduate. However, I cannot attest to how individual schools view LGBT+ applicants. I think that it depends on where you are applying; not all institutions think that fulfills diversity criteria. 17) @15, for better or worse, some diversity initiatives aim to broaden ""visible diversity"" which may not include LGBT+ or first-gen candidates.  And 13 brings up a valuable point, again from the administrative perspective.  International applicants may not qualify as diversity candidates, regardless of national/cultural background, because they have not faced the same educational and career and institutional barriers US-born/raised applicants of color would have faced.  The existence of such potentially contradictory objectives allows a great deal of subjectivity to intrude in the candidate review process. Ultimately, administrators make decisions about offers given overall institutional goals that are not necessarily consistent with the wishes or in the best interest of the program/department.  Ideally, decisions by adminstrators about offers would serve as a check against biases that could creep  (or storm) in during the review process, but the opposite could happen as well.",NA,

",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Drinking during interview dinner? This has probably been raised before, but I'm wondering what is people's take on drinking alcohol during the interview dinner. My PhD advisor would say to not have even a drop of alcohol and he would judge any candidate who would do otherwise. Others seem to think that it might make you look overly serious. 2) I've been on a number of search committees and I personally would not care one way or the other if a candidate had a beer or a glass of wine at dinner. Who the hell cares? If it were me I probably wouldn't, if only because I don't drink much and most of the time would rather have a soda or water. But I certainly wouldn't care if a job candidate had one. I also woudn't care if they didn't. Of course, that's just me. 3) Been to a number of dinners as a committee member and it's totally fine either way.  4) You can always follow the lead of the folks you are at dinner with.  If they order a beer, you feel free to do the same.  If they seem like teetotallers, they maybe you don't.  Either way having just one or two beers you should be fine.  Just don't go crazy. 4) I drank at dinners of all the jobs I was offered (as well as ones I wasn't).  But I know myself and that I'm not going to say something dumb after a beer or two.  Been on interview dinners where the candidate didn't drink a drop, and thought to myself, this person's being prudent. So it goes either way.  5) If you drink, have a drink (or two) but don't outdrink the committee.  If you don't drink, that's fine too.  On one I was sick and couldn't drink b/c of meds, but told the rest of them not to let me hold them back.   Remember, this is one of the few times the department will find a way to cover alcohol, so a lot of folks will want a glass of wine.  I did have one friend get wasted with the committee and still get the job, but I really would NOT recommend that approach.   6) Many departments will never cover alcohol no matter what, although I think it would be rude for the search committee not to cover the applicants' drinks. In any case, to answer the question, if the search committee is drinking, feel free to drink; if they aren't then you probably shouldn't. You should just be yourself during the interview, and I think that applies to drinking as well. Would you normally drink in social situations with colleagues? Then have a drink. 7) we interviewed last year and one of the candidates had 4 glasses of wine during dinner, while we each had one drink.  We all remarked later that was a big red flag to us and part of why we did not consider this person further. 8) There's also the ""drink to assure them you're not pregnant"" angle to consider (not that it should be necessary). 8) Just depends who is on the committee. I have gotten pretty drunk with interviewees in the past. Some of them received job offers. All had a great time.  9) It was very context dependent for me. If the people at dinner wanted the wine to flow, then I participated. It was clear at some interviews that the faculty were buying (not the uni) so I did not drink or only did so if they really wanted to buy me a beverage.  If the dinner participants wanted me to choose the wine, I usually said, ""I like red, but it's up to you to pick the bottle!""  But, if faculty want to drink more than 1 bottle of wine with you, don't do it.  I got very wine drunk during one interview dinner because faculty kept buying bottles and pouring me glasses; I didn't get the offer (actually search failed), but will never know if getting boozy played a role. 10) Ive played it by ear based on how I expected the dinner to go. If I thought it was more of a casual 'getting to know you' type of dinner, I'd have a beer, glass of wine, cocktail etc. with everyone else. I have a relatively high tolerance and I also keep a cognizent eye on my intake compared to everyone else and try to stick to 1 drink for myself to everyone elses 2. If I think its going to be a more formal dinner with more specific talk about science, the future, technichnical aspects of the job or the portion of the interview where I'm expected to ask questions about logistics associated with the position, I won't indulge at all as I don't want to not be taken seriously.   11) Many state schools have strict bans on alcohol, so the search head is buying your drinks. I'd stick to one; it shows that your are fun, but serious.  12) Other state schools have bans on using state funds for alcohol, but creative ways around those bans as well (there are many ways to get money with no strings attached in a large institution).  If in doubt, you can always ask if the host is paying or the department is paying, and choose how many drinks to order according to their answer. This is also a common question to ask in other situations (such as when giving an invited seminar) and so will not come out of the blue. 13) I've had the exact same drinking experience on every interview I've been on (some with offers, some not): 1 beer at dinner.",NA,"did I piss off the committee?

NA,"For fun So, I ran a logistic regression comparing those who have been invited for at least one campus interview and the rest of us, from the anon qualification page.  The significant variables were:  publications (positive), # of classes (weak positive), and years on the market (negative).  I expected # of grants, or having received a grant, to be significant, but it wasn't.  I didn't run the analysis for those who were short-listed or got phone interviews, though, and the season is only halfway through.  Yes, I should get a life. (1) This may be an example of the addiction/productivity phenomenon discussed below. But maybe you could get a pub out of it! (2) Go for it - publish it as a note somewhere :) (3) Send it to nature jobs, they just asked for people to talk about their post-doc and what to do and not to do, and it would fit perfectly. (4) sounds great except for the nonscientific manner in which the data were collected. I'm constantly surprised by the interest in and collection of self-reported data on this site. (5) So, you report that in the methods, and discuss the potential problems with it. (6) it's just something of a compulsion - Have Data Will Analyze. (8) I understand the compulsion. Just don't read too much into it. For example, people are reporting time on the market down to the quarter year, for some reason, I think it should be done at least at the number of days, if not minutes. (9) Please, don't give me ideas :-) (10)@ the OP, um, I have a different definition of 'fun', @4 Yeah, this is definitely correct, the data are pretty poor. If I were a reviewer, I'd rate it with the phone in polls on cable TV. There are 75 folks self reporting on this list, and I'd guess we're the more OCD end of the distribution. As oh, so many rejection letters have told us, in the end it your success will come down to the quirks of 'fit' which means does the SC have some reason to like you personally. (11) While quirks of fit may apply to ultimately getting the job, it doesn't apply to phone interviews or campus invites (in the absence of phone interviews). The first round of screening is more likely to be based on your 'stats' rather than your personality if they haven't met or heard of you yet. Also, you can't thoroughly bash self-report data without knowing its representativeness. The 'OCD personality' you mentioned could be a restriction of range towards the more attractive candidates, and so the results would be even more telling given the SC won't even glance at the lower end of the distribution. Not saying that the more attractive candidates are on the wiki, but more conscientious people are more likely to seek, monitor, and obtain jobs (supported by research).

I've seen a couple of ""teaching postdoc"" positions, that are 50/50 teaching and research. Usually something like a 2/2 course load, 2-3 year contract (12 months in one case). Is this just an obscure way to advertise for a visiting professor? 2) Have also wondered about this. 3) In my experience these are literally 50-50 positions, where the PI pays half of the postdoc's salary (grant or startup) for research work in their lab, and then the department/institution pays for the other half for the teaching.  If done well, these can be a win-win.  It helps a PI spread out their funding, get postdocs what they need, which is research AND teaching experience (especially as instructor of record), and helps the instituion meet its teaching needs.  I've been one of these and have hired one of these.  I think they're a good model and are good positions. 4) Some of the positions titled teaching postdoc are simply teaching with an expectation of education research. However, there's more and more popping up where you are working with a particular PI and do research in their lab. I'm in a position like this right now and that is the case, though my salary is all paid by teaching. The person with the position previously had great luck with apps at SLAC. 5) I got an R1 position after one of these. And now, they think that I'm more ""advanced"" than other recent hires because I had already taught. I might have made a few more dollars in negotiations out of it. I would NOT take one of these positions until you have at least 3 years of postdoc and (probably) a hard drive full of data that you will write up. What ever they say, you will be teaching like crazy (all first teaching preps are time sinks, and any place that offers these are expecting teaching to come first). With a lot of hard work you can find time (but probably not between M and F too often) to turn that data into papers. But, you probably will lecture 2-3 times per week, and oversee 2 lab sections per week. So that is 9 hours of classroom time per week. So, don't expect too much work-life balance if you want to stay relevant for R1s, R2s, and don't expect to have much money to collect new data (especially expensive molecular data). And then after a year of this, emphasize teaching (professor of record) and show graphs from your teaching evaluations in your application. Your competition won't have these (unless they are Asst Profs) and the biggest fear at an R1 is that folks can't balance all of the different responsibilites and stay relevant for external funding. Having reasonable production along with what will seem at an R1 is a heavy teaching load will win a great deal of respect on many committees.

Is there anyone with firsthand knowledge of what it is like there for new faculty and whether the fables and legends are true? 2) Does anywhere not claim to be collaborative and integrative? 3) It used to be true but isn't anymore (at least in organismic and evolutionary biology). There had been a long-operating philosophy that there wouldn't be strife and competition amongst junior faculty if they all knew that they would be going elsewhere for tenure, and for many years that was the way it worked. There was a clear shift about fifteen years ago when they started offering tenure to a large proportion of their junior faculty. 4) ""Large proportion"" is a slight overstatement. There's still a high frequency of tenure denial in OEB... 5) And a number of OEB faculty have left prior to going up for tenure in the recent past, which affects the numbers and may be informative in and of itself 6) everythign I've heard is if you want a collaborative environment, don't go to Harvard.

My project is funded by a grant that I didn't write. I did put in (as PI) for a large grant (~2 mil USD), but it wasn't even invited for a full proposal. I want to try to express that I am trying to be proactive on independant funding. What do folks think about listing unfunded proposals (own section, or marked clearly of course)? In this specific case, I'm thinking the early reject makes it perhaps ineligible, but more generally? 2) Wouldn't try this at an R1. Might be fine for PUI, not sure about the grey area of R2. 3) Better to have your letter writer descibe it as evidence of your ""go getter attitude"". 4) I've gotten a lot of faculty member advice that says the opposite, that you can have current grants, pending grants, completed grants, and unfunded grants on your CV. If you only have unfunded grants on it then it might look odd. But if you plan on revising and putting in again they will consider it part of the learning curve of grantwriting. 5) Already funded/completed, and pending, yes. Unfunded is not useful at R1, because they want to see proof you can actually attain funding. You don't include all your manuscript rejections... 6) I had an unfunded grant when a post-doc and one of the PIs is my letter writer. He mentions in his letter that the grant was unfunded, why it was unfunded and how much work I invested into it. It shows I'm at least trying to find funding. If one the PIs on the grant is a letter writer you may want to approach him/her to include it. 7) if it was an invited preproposal, I'd include it on the CV. Shows you've made it past one hurdle.   8) Best leave it for the rec letter.  But it will be a real shining point if you mention it in your chalk talk on interviews.  It shows you're thinking like a PI and have a plan moving forward.  9) Disagree with most of these opinions.  On a search at my nice R1 a few years ago, ""willingness to seek extramural funding"" was one of our search criteria, and listing that you were applying for grants was a small positive (getting grants, a large positive).  Putting it on your CV demonstrates you know how the game is played and you're buying lotto tickets, even if you haven't won the lotto yet. 10) As an asst prof looking to change schools, I always thought along the lines as #9, showing that you're trying. I think most SC members know the low acceptance rates and the ""lotto"" aspect to funding. However, the longer I ""play the game"" the more imbalanced becomes my ratio of unfunded to funded applications. I'm wondering if showing the imbalance on the CV will start being a detriment. Every year I apply for NSF and every year I get rejected. (Not always the same proposal and not always the same granting department or call). Does that look bad? 11) Curious also. I (still a postdoc) had 5 preproposals invited but not funded in NSF BIO. 12) if you're worried about the proportion of not funded vs. funded, then you can always just include a few unfunded proposals to show you're in the game (but not make it look like you've put out 50 failed proposals, even if that's the case)",NA,

Option 1 is a 2-year fellowship at a US research institution; I wrote the project and get to direct the research; I will have to be on another visa, and my partner will have to live abroad, while I only have 2 weeks vacation/year; no option for teaching under this option. Option 2 is a 3-year postdoc at the UK institution where I did my PhD; I will have to do the work they need for the first 2 years, with the option to design my own research in year 3; it is paid 75% of the US option, and paid in pounds (which may be volatile over Brexit next year); there is an option to make it permanent, but this is based on funding after year 2 (the current estimate is for STEM funding to halve in the UK after Brexit); this option has a PhD student to mentor, and the option to get some lecturing experience; my partner lives in the UK, so I could see them again, and I get 6 weeks vacation/year. So, which to choose - would the fellowship or teaching experience look better for a future job? I would like this to be my last postdoc....

I would take any position closer to where he is anytime. 4) It also dependes on when and where do you wanna try to get a Faculty job 5)I agree with #4.

Do I e-mail the search chair indivdually after the on-campus has been scheduled? Do I e-mail the HR personnel that is arranging all the interviews? Do I e-mail both? 1) I'd bring it up to the search committee chair after the interview has been scheduled. If you're already in vontact with an HR rep then also include them. Be very clear about your needs because they may have no idea what is required (ie, I will need a private room for 30 minutes every three hours to pump). (fyi, I was pumping during an on-campus interview last year). good luck! 2) I pumped at several interviews last year and the accomodations were generally good. It was actually one of the only times I really enjoyed having to pump because it was nice to get a break where I didn't have to talk to anyone! I went through the search chairs and they provided time on my schedule and either connected me with someone's private office or a lactation room (props to campuses who have lactation rooms). They also usually had fridge access. You can also call the hotel and tell them you need a medical fridge in your room if they don't already have fridges. Good luck!!! 3) OP--Thank you!! I was pregnant last year during my on-campuses ;) Hoping this year I have better luck securing a job to pay for these F1s! :) 3) Just want to second the ""be very clear about your needs"" bit. Recently, when I asked a colleague about accomodations at *our* university for a visiting scientist she said ""well, there's an extra chair in the women's bathroom"" (in our building at least, I guess). If lactation is too much for a biology department to handle, is that really a place you want to work? 4) Would you reject an offer from a place like this one even if you don't have any other offer and you're also out of funding for your postdoc? Genuine question as I may be in a situation like this one in this upcoming job season, if I get interviews.  5) No, #4 I wouldn't reject an offer just for this reason. There are departments/people that are unaware of what they could do different, and you can help change once you're a faculty member. The department I'm in is very supportive of mothers (about 6 women faculty with kids under age 10), and we still don't have a designated lactation room (have used empty offices when the need arises). 6) My advice (as a previous job-market pumper) is to be very direct and unapologetic about your needs, with whomever is scheduling your day. In my case, it was usually the department chair though once I had an admin do my schedule and I just told her. FWIW I did turn down an offer be they were a little weird about the pumping thing, but mostly bc I went to breakfast with 3 men who spent the time talking about how nagging them was a wife's duty, etc etc....so, I think department attitudes can certainly be a reason to turn down an offer (but there are so many other factors involved!) 2again) agreed about being upfront. Chairs are often slow about sending schedules so it helps to bug them for some notice just so you can make sure the breaks work. I pumped at 10 and 2 at work so I would just tell them that I needed a 30 minute break in a private room with an electrical outlet around 10am and 2pm (plus or minus 30 mins is fine). That worked well.  I also typically did a quick pump at the hotel before dinner if possible. I had custodial staff walk in to the room where I was pumping twice on interviews (at different places) - one time they ignored me and proceeded to change a lightbulb across the room! I also had an admin person at one interview deliver my pump to me in different lactation rooms across campus and take the milk back to the fridge in the building where the department was after I was finished. She had run a daycare for years and had 6 kids and made my life SO much easier.   7) On rejecting the job-- your clueless search chair is just one person who may be woefully, maybe even willingly uninformed about rules for accomodations.  If the SC can't help, email the dept head.  Part of their job is compliance for the dept.  In all likelihood they will know the Dept Head knows they need to accommodate.  If they don't, well, you might need to back out and send an email to the dean, HR, and perhaps even Title IX/Disability.  ",NA,

So I asked what they can do, told him what the 4 recent hires I know got as a first offer (a lot more) and the chair got all huffy about me asking, says he has to go to the administration and I asked him to do so to see what we could get done. He talked over me a bunch, didn't let me speak, was very aggressive, and essentially threatened to go to 2nd and 3rd candidates. I'm not sure what's wrong with just asking him to ask (they can always say no!). Is this normal? I have no idea what to do now. I guess just wait. It was so unpleasant! 2) Can you look up salaries of current faculty online? Or ask some recent hires what they got? 3) 1 here; I found a few wildly different estimates from a newspaper but also from the uni a doc with salary averages by department and trends over time--those are very obviously much closer to what other people are offered elsewhere and much higher than my offer. So I sent an email with that info and basically am asking for the equivalent of average Asst Prof at that uni from 2 years ago, even though it's lower than peer unis (who are themselves attempting to increase salaries). Just not sure why this ask was enough to cause such an apoplexy. My ask is totally in keeping with the salaries of first offers for R1s on the negotiations page. Also note this person hasn't been a chair long. But I don't have anyone else to negotiate with, clearly. As a woman, I felt like he was offended and wanted to railroad me into signing the original offer! 4) First, congrats on the offer, but sorry about your situation here. How did the other parts of the negotiation go (e.g., start-up, research associate support, GRA support, summer salary, etc.)? Did something happen in that part of the negotiation that made the salary stuff more awkward? Lastly, you may not want to answer here, but do you think the negotiation would negatively affect your ability to work with the chair if you take the position? 5) If it's a public R1, there really should be an online database of salaries, usually housed on a newpaper site. It may be hard to find though. In my mind, ~78 to 90 is typical for a new assistant prof at an R1, which is consistent with the negotiations tab on the previous 2017-18 file. 6) #1 again. Thanks for your thoughts #4 & 5, and the congrats. Yes, 78-90 does seem typical #5, but this is MUCH lower than that. More like SLAC. I suggested mildly that equity/parity was important to me, that 79 was typical at peer institutions; this precipitated threats to go to other candidates. The rest of the negotiations were also bad. Got ""we'll see"" on a 2nd visit (my first ask),and I didn't push past first offer on GRA, summer salary (3 mos over 2 yrs is ok). We didn't even get to start up or the seeming bump in teaching requirements they put in relative to what I was told at my interview. Didn't ask for my start up request. I sent it anyway with the email backing up salary request, (asked at 76K). 7) I'm guessing you're just dealing with a jerk. There are legitimate reasons the salary may be low, but no legitimate reasons for being huffy about someone respectfully point that out. I hope things work out in your favor! 8) No advice here, but the situation stinks and it sounds like you're handling it about as well as possible. All the best! (x2). 9) This seems like a giant red flag to me. Not necessarily from the salary standpoint, while not great feeling like you've been low-balled, the chair is probably in a tough position with the salary available. What would concern me is the reaction you got. If the chair is already coming off this way to a candidate, I would start to wonder about how he treats the faculty. Usually everyone is on their best behavior during interviews and negotiations, but he had no problem being upset when you (reasonably) asked about a higher salary with data to backup your request. Not sure I would be all that inclined to go there unless I didn't have any other opportuinities. Just a thought. x2 10) the ""bump"" in teaching requirements that you mentioned also seems to be something that could be indicative of a larger issue. How much of a difference are we talking about versus what you were led to believe in the interview? 11) Precarious situation. If already employed, I'd say just go talk to the dean instead. However, you don't want to start off on the wrong foot with the chair, if you decide to take the job. I personally do not believe chairs should be involved in negotiating beyond the role of an advisor to administration and an advocate for the candidate. My chair has personally screwed up multiple searches with his stupidity and inability to communicate and prioritize. Question: does the chair position at the university rotate regularly...or...is it more like a feaux head position that can pretty much be had for life? If rotates regularly, I wouldn't consider the chair at all in your decision making process, and I probably would ask to talk directly with a dean for further negotiation. Good luck. Let us know how it turns out. Just remember, you are negotiating with the university, not the chair. If he/she is a poor interemediary, ask to speak with someone up the chain of command. 12) I agree that your choices here may be different if the chair is likely to rotate out.  If they are offering you less than $75k at an R1 that is out of line unless it is super low cost of living.   You may want to mention it to the dean if you really want the job, but that is a risk of retaliation.   This guy either is trying to balance the budget on your back or he is trying to sabotage this search.  My chair advocates for us and would not do this.13) #1 here; thanks for the perspective. It's an interim chair. I don't want to undermine him because he'll be a colleague if I accept but I think he must be clueless on his role --I worry talking with the dean directly will stir up trouble--what are your thoughts? Also the teaching bump isn't awful, it was supposedly 1/1 but now says 1/2 bumped down to 1/1 if you have external funding (this raises my eyebrows but may not be a big deal?) & an extra grad course required every other year (that I wouldn't mind doing, just didn't really want in my contract if no one else has that spelled out). As of now, I'm considering taking a prestigous 2nd postdoc instead because of this start to the negotiations. But waiting to see. If I did go with this TT offer, I want to commit to succeeding there and not feel like I've sacrificed my own self worth & be looking to escape before tenure from the get go. I'm also concerned about the future of the department if this is what they pay. (sorry for the super long thread, readers!) 14) Is it a region of the country that you would really like to live? That pretty much trumps all for me. If you really want the job, I wouldn't worry too much about pissing off one colleague. x2 It's almost impossible to be besties with every single one of your colleagues. If this guy is an ass, chances are there are a lot of other colleagues that he doesn't get along with, as well. B/c you have the prestigous post doc in your back pocket, I suggest taking your time and asking for as much information possible. Maybe even ask for info on recent starting salaries in the department. Maybe the salaries are just really low at this school? If that's the case, it could be hard for the chair/dean to pay you considerably more than more senior faculty. There's still no excuse for the chair to be an ass about any of this. I don't know what's worse, having a bad negotiating experience or being ignorant on how to negotiate and getting rail-roaded. I was the latter 10+ years ago, and every new hire after me made more money than me until I received tenure/promotion. But then when they started receiving tenure/promotion, I was back to the bottom. Kudos to you for taking the negotiation process seriously, taking your time, and seeking help from other to be more well-informed. I wish I was as prepared when I hit the market. 15) I'm not sure if you have a sense of this or not, but a lot of interim chairs end up becoming permanent chairs, so it's something to consider. Are they actively searching for a chair at the moment? 16) Good luck and please let us know how it goes.   12 again) I've seen interim chairs do crappy negotiations.  Either b/c they don't want the job or because they think saving money will win them points or they just don't have the clout.   Talk to the dean, the search chair, or a senior professor you really felt was on your side if you want the job.  Failing the search is expensive in time, money, and losing a good candidate. It is likely someone there will want to help you.  17) How did this turn out? 18) So many details missing here for me, where is this place? what is the startup offered? what is the salary offer vs requested? You have to talk to the dean at some point during the process, when you do ask for a salary bump. I don't think this concerns the Chair. In my institution (SLAC), the Chair does not even know what the salary or starup is for each person hired. This is the job of the DEAN. Chairs have no say in our instituition.  19) this one is tough, don't be shy about talking to the dean directly, also if you had any senior faculty in the department that were nice and seemed with it, ask them directly about what is up with the chair. Also if you have any mentors that know folks in your possible new department, might ask them to help figure out what is going on.  Interim chair can screw things up badly and may not actually care--- they will be gone in XX months and there will then be a new chair. Don't assume the whole department is as the interim chair is.

If so, it makes sense to translate ranks at international organisations to US equivalents for this column. If we pedantically list the actual job title instead, people (a) won't be able to filter to show just the jobs at the right rank, and (b) when scanning through, will have to know what different job titles mean in different countries (e.g. that ""lecturer"" in Australia means the same as ""asst. prof"" in the US, not the same as ""lecturer"" in the US). I had been adding jobs using the US-equivalent rank and an explanation in notes, but someone has gone and changed these to the actual local position titles. What does everyone else think is more useful? 2) I don't agree. If you're considering applying to jobs abroad, you should probably already know what the ranks mean. Also, people from outside the US use this board too, and so shouldn't have to back-translate ranks for their own countries. 3) I appreciate the effort to clarify things. My opinion is that it's best to put the job title in the ""rank"" column and explain what it might mean in the notes. x5 4) What's a Junior Research Group Leader in Germany? 5) It says in the ad - 3yr term limit unless they get more DFG funding and the group does well involves supervision of PhD students and teaching, pay is 15 TV-L",NA,"What to send for teaching evaluations What do people send in for teaching evaluations when asked for this information in an application. I have teaching evaluations that range from pages upon pages of scantrons ranking me, the facilities, the course material, etc down to handwritten notes. These evaluations also date back to my early TA days up through full courses I taught more recently. Do you usually send it all in and let the SC figure it out or somehow summarize it into a few pages? Also, I only have postive teaching evaluations (not bragging) and can't find an evaluation that says anything negative (some are constructive criticism but not negative). Would a SC notice this and think that I'm limiting what I submit to only include good stuff? 2) my teaching evals for a class are all in one PDF sent from the univesity. They include a summary up front and scans afterwards. I just send this as it shows that I'm not hiding anything. I don't think they are going to pour over your individual scantrons and think that you cherry picked the 100 best to include from a class of 106. 3) I've taught a lot, so have a lot of evals, plus I often find it hard to decipher eat schools questions and scoring system. So, I made a spreadsheet with summaries of evals from all my classes (maybe 2 pages total) and put in some student comments (another 2 pages), with a note saying I could provide full, original evals upon request.

I am from an European country but I did my PhD and two postdocs in the US. I spent there around 10 years and I am married to a US citizen. Over the years most of my applications have been to US universities. Easily over 200 applications in total (most of these when I was still living in the US). However, I got almost no interviews, whereas I got a lot of interest from European universities. My CV is quite strong research-wise and I also have a lot of teaching experience. I know that R2 and SLAC institutions will not want to deal with non-US applicants, but I have always assumed that R1 could easily deal with the complications of hiring a non-US person (especially in cases like mine in which the spouse is a US citizen). Also, I assume that people in the job committee will not care about the country of origin of the applicants, and they would leave the complications of hiring a non-US person without visa/green card to the people in administration. I have asked around and some people have told me that this is more or less the case, whereas other people have told me that non-US applicants without current job permission will have a very hard time getting selected. I guess this will ultimately depend on the university. I would appreciate any further feedback. 2) Looking at the profile of current staff at US R1s, I'm a bit shocked by how uncommon recent hires with foreign PhDs are. Here in Australia, about 30% of academics are hired from overseas. The percentage in the US looks much lower. 3)#2 why r u shocked? 4) Given that globally 20% of academics look for jobs overseas and the US must be a target for many of these applications, it seems indicative of widespread discrimination in hiring 5) IMO, without the ""correct"" pedigree, US R1s won't look at you when places of equal or higher rank in other countries will (i.e. my experience is the same as the OP's). Not just Europe, but Australia and New Zealand too, so it's not just because I'm from Europe. If you're not in the US, it's often assumed that you don't know the funding system. 6) To OP, I am not a US citizen, did not do my PhD in the US, but did my postdoc in the US and landed a tenure track position here after being on the job market for two years. My experience is that sometimes it takes a bit of luck but also some networking. Networking and getting yourself known at conferences are very important. Use of academic twitter is somewhat important too, as this will make you known to other faculty members who may or may not be on search committees. Most of the time, it is not the best applicant who gets the job, but the applicant with the most fit or the applicant whose work that some of the search committee members are already familiar with or know. It is human nature to shortlist people that you are more familiar with. Regarding R2s and SLACs not dealing with non-US applicants, that is not completely true. Some of them don't, but most of them do. And nowaways, some R2s are offering packages comparable to R1s.  7) 5 here. Networking doesn't explain why non-European Universities showed interest in me when R1s didn't. Those places also happened to have specific selection criteria. 8) 6 here. Networking in the US is somewhat different from networking in other places. Maybe in Europe they look for the best candidates regardless of who you are. As much as I hate to admit it or say it, academia in the US can be a bit fraternal. But most of the time it is not fair. I applied to a whole heap of jobs too, only to see interviews given to people who are less qualified (according to publications) but better connected than myself. 9) It's not clear what you mean by networking being different. The kind of ""better connected"" I've observed was precisely the pedigree effect, e.g. search chair postdoced in same lab as new hire did PhD. 10) Brief comment from US academic, but to be honest, it has taken me 10 years or so to get a solid handle on the international academic scene. I feel like an idiot now for not knowing the schools and research I do now, but I suspect my story is fairly common. Short story - we're idiots. 11) I have non-US PhD and non-US postdoc and had 1 in-person interview in US (of 14 applications, not all to US schools). I wonder for the original poster if the US postdoc looks appealing for non-US positions, as a way for those departments to network with US institutions, whereas in the US it's not valued above a standard postdoc? Just wondering. It seems to be always about what the hiring dept./committee wants, not always who is the most qualified. 12) Doubtful. In many places, a sizeable proportion of faculty is international, and they'll have a large network already. 13) I only have extensive experience with two R1s that are both ~top 10 ecology & evolution universities. This is obviously a pretty biased sample among all US institutions, but I've seen many searches at both of these schools and have never had the impression that candidates from other countries are at any major disadvantage provided they speak english and are competitive in the rest of their record. Of course, these schools both have enough money to fly candidates in from overseas and I know that can be a major sticking point at some places. I know one person who was doing a postdoc in Europe (he was American), but would regularly list his address as being based at a collaborator's host institution in the US because he was afraid that the additional cost and hassle of the oversea flight would deter search committees from selecting him. 14) I'm a Canadian in a TT job at an American R1. I am also shocked by the low number of international faculty (in Canada it would regularly be above 30%. My department didn't seem to care, but I did have difficulty interviewing at other institutions because I didn't know the NSF funding system inside and out. 15) Landed a TT position in US (UK native, PhD and postdoc in US) - apparently, they legally have to fail to hire a US native before they'll hire a foreign researcher, so you're automatically going to be second choice. 16) @15, this is simply not true! Maybe for some very specific positions funded in certain ways or for public schools in some states, but not generally. 17) It is very difficult for three reasons: Visa issue, unknown Alma mater, no NSF for foregneirs; plus, as a foregneir in the US, I have never been able to accept any teaching assigment (eg, adjunct) because of my visa.",NA,"Broad searches where the department has no one like you Is it appropriate to explicitly say, in the cover letter, that you bring expertise that is completely not represented in the department?

However, I know some colleges charge extortionate student fees if you're not an American citizen, so any that you'd know of that just ask for personal funding would be great as Ireland has great PhD funding opportunities in marine science (but since I want to study tropical sharks I'd need to be directed by someone in an American college who is familliar with that field of research). 2) The horror stories you've read about US college costs do not apply here. PhD positions in the sciences in the US are generally completely funded, along with a (meager) salary; forget about any programs that you pay for.  Typically applications are due Decemeber-January (check the exact dates).  You'll want to identify potential advisors this fall, by reading their webpages, papers, etc.  Then send personal (not spammed) emails to the most promising ones, expressing your interests and asking if they're taking students.  They'll tell you if there's a possibility at their place and how to proceed.  Applying without pre-approval from a potential advisor is unlikely to succeed.  It might be slightly harder for non-US citizens to get into grad school in the US, but far from impossible if your advisor wants you.  I don't know much about technician positions, maybe just keep your eyes on ecolog.  Good luck! 5) If you are looking for a research tech/assistant position, many if not most of those in the US, especially in EEB fields, are funded by soft money.

RFEs seem to be the new norm. Our institution is now actively looking for US citizens or permanent residents in all new staff and faculty searches because they cannot guarantee visas anymore. DoL is also raising the minimum salary expectations to the point where it is no longer affordable to hire a foreigner. My salary more than doubled what was originally offered as a result of DoL's insistence; fortunately, the university will honour it. 8) I'm a foreign postdoc at (very fancy private) US R1, just got H-1B under the wire after a last minute RFE, which occurred after the return of premium processing. My international office has an immigration lawyer on staff, who handled my case. We provided all kinds of extra evidence comparing qualifications/salary to equivalent institutions, and a confidential (I never saw) salary list for all postdocs in the department. It will be easier if you have a US PhD (they will understand it better and you can add your W2s), and I do suggest getting a lawyer involved. Not sure why #7 had issues with the salary change, that is supposed to be for non-cap-exempt only. Hope that is helpful for someone. 9) 7 here again, not sure what you mean by 'non-cap-exempt' as I thought all faculty positions at universities were H-1B cap exempt anyway?

However, the add also says that the candidate will ""have the opportunity to develop an independent research program."" It is a liberal arts college so the course load isn't surprising to me. However, I really want to maintain a student-led research program wherever I end up and I am concerned that it will be hard to do that with a heavy teaching load. Perhaps tellingly, none of the faculty listed have links to websites or areas of research listed on the department page. I would love to hear from folks at places with similar teaching loads and how they've managed (or not) their research programs. 2) Not faculty, but something you might try and figure out (assuming you haven't) is who's responsible for lab sections and how they apply toward contact hours, and whether those are really 4 different courses a semester, or you might, say be teaching 3 sections of intro whatever and an advanced course in your area. Still a lot of contact hours, but a lot less prep. 3) As 2 said, it really depends on how contact hours are applied and your time management skills. If contact hours are applied in a strict sense, then that's 12 hours in a class room a week. For example, if you teach a lecture (3 hrs), 2x 3 hr labs for your lecture, and one additional 3 hr lecture, you are at 12 contact hours. So, 2 lectures and 2 labs. That's not really that bad. 4) Smallpondscience.com has some good perspectives on this 4) Some schools give you credit for supervising undergrad research. Ask about that? With most jobs, apply and then ask questions on site when you get an interview. Practice phrasing it as what you can offer them. They get jumpy if they think you don't want to teach. 5) In my limited experience, 12 hours is a 4-4, a standard course load for a teaching college. In that case your expectation will be to teach and you won't get credit for or have incentive to do research. Many teaching colleges now advertise to include a research component, but when you meet with the dean during the interview, you realize they are not interested in that and if there is any research expectation it is to go to your conference or a teaching conference each year. I learned this over three interviews, all with 12 contact hour ads. Ymmv. 6) I get the impression that how the number of contact hours is reflected on actual teaching varies between institutions. For example, in the UC-Colorado Springs ad they say that the teaching load is 15 contact hours, which for them translates into a 3-2 load. 7) The UC position would have the same contact hour accounting as the job OP is talking about. From the UC ad: 'Standard load is 15 contact hours per academic year (fall and spring)."" 15 hours over a year is a 3-2. OP is saying 12 hours a semester, which would be 24 per year. On average, one 3-credit lecture and one 1-credit lab are three contact hours each. Twelve hours a semester would be four classes, or 24 hours over a year (4-4), and 15 hours a year would be 5 classes over a year (splitting them in semesters would be a 3-2, or a 2-3). The only oddballs that get thrown in are if there are 1-credit seminars, which usually count for one or two contact hours, or shorter labs which can count as two contact hours instead of three. You could also get credit for hours spent advising student projects, but ime that is rare at a teaching college. TLDR: contact hours divided by three is approximately the number of classes you will teach. 8) I'm at a smaller state school with a 12-hr per semester load. I teach a 2-2 schedule (labs count for credit) with a total of <40 students (classes are capped at 18 or 20). Teaching is certainly a major component of my job, but I have externally-funded research projects and active undergrad resarch and mentoring. It feels like a pretty nice balance to me. 9) 12 hours a semester is a 4-4. A 2-2 is a 12 hour per year load. 8 again) There is a distinction between credit- and contact-hours. 12 credit hours are often 4-4 loads; 12 contact hours, which OP was asking about and which my institution uses, can be allocated at the discretion of the department. In my case, labs count for contact hours and I end up with a 2-2 load. 10) so your lectures and labs are six hours long? What a weird school. 11) 12 CONTACT hours. This works out if: three one-hour lectures per class. One three hour lab per class. Six contact hours per course. 2 courses per semester for 12 contact hours. 12) 3 one-hour lectures is 3 contact hours, one lab is 3 contact hours... that is 6 contact hours. So if you teach a lecture and a lab, you are teaching 6 contact hours. So you are saying you teach two courses - one lecture and one lab... that is 6 contact hours. Are you trolling this board? 13) Wow, calm down. If each class has a three-hour lab and three one hour lectues (6 total hours), then two classes makes 12 hours in the classroom each week. (OP) thre is some useful information in here, so please don't delete this. 14) I think the confusion here is coming because at some schools the lecture and the associated lab count as 2 separate classes with students getting 2 grades, while at other schools the lecture+lab is one class with students getting 1 grade for the combo. The lecture+lab = 1 class model is particularly common at small schools where an upper-level course might only have 5-10 students. But, anyway, the take home message is that 12 contact hours = 12 hours in front of students per week, whereas 12 credit hours could be many more hours in front of students per week.   14) I am a titled faculty at a SLAC and I can tell you that you can do research but as others have said it depends on what a 4/4 load means and this varies by institution. At my institution I have a 7 credit load, which translates to 12 contact hours per week per semester (about). We do get credit for leading undegrad research. It is VERY HARD but it is doable. You just have to work weekends and nights. On the other hand, expectations are not very high. They don't expect you to publish in high tier journals, or anything like that. In fact some faculty have told me its ok to publish in undergraduate journals, or do only a conference abstract. HTH",NA,

Should permanent research agency and research institute jobs go on the faculty page and term research jobs on the postdoc page, regardless of level? 2) Let's put permanent jobs with faculty jobs. They have similar qualifications and employment horizons, so that seems best. 3) I really like the idea of permanent research jobs getting posted here, but I think they should be on a different sheet - last year, there were ~500 tenure-track jobs alone. If the Cary Institute wants a research scientist or the coop units want an assistant unit leader, I guess it's good to put it here - but there are (were) tons of other federal/agency jobs, too, and those are so different I wouldn't include those types. Just my two cents, though. 4) I think a separate ""Non-faculty Permanent"" positions sheet, or something like that would be better than combining with Faculty or non-TT teaching. 5) I agree that a separate page would be good. Who knows how to set one up with the form to add new jobs?  6) What about temporary research assistant prof or non-pdoc soft money jobs?

My PhD advisor thinks that on the CV, that will look like an unpaid position (e.g. at museums, it is a courtesy appointment). How should it be worded to convey it is a full time position, but slightly better than postdoc (in this department, it confers PI ability on grants, and is paid way more)? 2) At our place, that's what all postdocs are called.  I think people will figure it out, especially when your postdoc advisor writes a letter. 3) What is the difference between Postdoctoral ""Researcher"", Postdoctoral ""Fellow"", and Postdoctoral ""Research Associate""? Is there any difference? 4) Postdoctoral fellows are on independent fellowships, whereas postdoc associates or researchers are paid through a PI's grant. 5) At my place it is the same as #4. Fellows often get paid more (up to 15k different) but they have to handle their own health insurance, not through the uni. Not sure what Research Associate is here though. 6) #4 is correct. At the universities which I have been, postdoctoral fellows are those with their own fellowships while research associate is postdocs which are paid by the PI's grant. 7) All postdocs at my instituion are ""postdoctoral fellows"", regardless of whether they brought in their own money. 8) ""fellow"" implies that you have a fellowship i.e. your own money; see http://postdocs.mit.edu/home/postdoctoral-position/defining-postdoc-fellows-and-associates. 9) #5 here, I am at MIT. I think it is a VERY institution specific definition here (as I said it has health insurance implications), my PhD R1 did not use these labels or the insurance thing. MIT likes to go its own way. Wouldn't generalize to everyone based on them. 8) I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow for 4 years at an Ivy and then I was promoted to Research Associate (which is not the same as Postdoctoral Associate or Postdoctoral Research Associate). Generally you need 3-5 years postdoctoral experience and you can lead major grants and projects. Often these positions are permanent. I got a descent pay raise. I think many look at this as an advanced position, but I prefer to be called a fellow since i always brought in my own funding (well. nothing is done alone. that's another philosophical topic). 9) OP here - #8 are you me? I am at an Ivy and have 5 years experience (at a different R1). I have heard of these positions becoming permanent in some cases as well, but there has been no hint of that to me. 10) Hi OP, #8 here and now #10 - well, if we are the same, then an Asst Prof (at a different R1) is coming your way! I had Postdoctoral Fellow on my application, so my promotion to Research Associate wasn't even a factor. It's a hard time, but you will make it through (if we are the same indeed)! I do know a lot of Research Associates that are long-term and some permanent, but I think after too many years in these positions may actually make it harder to get a faculty job elsewhere. Your ability to bring in money does help though! 11) OP/#9, thanks for the positive affirmation haha. Previous institution was Fellow, followed by Postdoc Associate (NSF that I was Senior Personnel).

The 2016-2017 wiki format was pretty crappy and very few jobs were posted on it compared to previous years. Was hoping that it would return to the simpler format. For the record: 485 job entries were made in the 2015-2016 Bio Jobs Wiki versus 12 postings in the 2016-2017. I'd really prefer if there were a General Bio Jobs wiki that followed the same format as ecoevojobs. 2) Agreed, I hardly ever went over the the Bio Jobs wiki because of the format, also it seems that there is a lot of overlap between the two? x2 3) I forked this document for bio focused positions. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GXTTyvKYU1z4T4DIM2p4GuohR4xiHkOmFkKPSawhIic/edit?usp=sharing 4) @3 I think this will lead to a lot of confusion and redundancy. 5) I am open to other suggestions that you think might be more constructive. 5) There will be some redundancy as there has been in previous years, but for many, the eco/evo wiki doesn't list job opportunities that are outside of the eco/evo specialy field that many of us can be applying to. In my experience the general biology wiki was more useful for my job search, particularly because my training is multi-disciplinary 4) @5 Every discipline-based classification will have people who overlap at the boundaries. My concern is that ""biology"" is so wide that it will make it harder for the core audience of EEB folks to find relevant jobs among all the biochemistry, molecular biology, cellular biology, neurobiology jobs. Not sure what others think about that. Instead of introducing an overlapping, competing site, maybe an adjacent non-overlapping site devoted to non-EEB biology would work better. x4 3) @4 It's certainly not an overlapping competting document. It's an adjacent doc to host bio positions. There will be overlap but will probably carry a lot more mol bio / bio med positions.  4) @3 Maybe calling it ""Mol Bio / Biomed Jobs"" would make that clear, because EE seems like a subset of Bio. 5) Mol Bio/Biomed doesn't include bioinformatics or quantitative bio, which may or may not overlap with EEB. A column on a general bio page indicating the subdiscipline may be useful for filtering. 5) For those of us whose overlaps are at the other end (physical rather than biological sciences) it would be nice also to have better pages for earth sciences and environmental engineering -- if anyone has time?

I suspect it is different for each situation but how do you approach your department chair and colleagues about you interviewing elsewhere? Since interviews take multiple days and your absence will require you to make plans for your classes when you're gone, I assume you discuss your absence with your chair. Do you just make a plan for your classes and email the chair to say you'll be gone but don't give details? My question applies to those who don't want to make it public that they are looking for TT jobs at other Universities. 2) Yeah, try to keep it under wraps by saying you've got personal travel. 3) Just say invited seminar. 4) Only one of my colleagues (not my chair) knows I am on the market. I have a huge teaching load. If/when I am invited to interview I will work out the details of my absence with my students. I see no reason for anyone else to know (or notice). But my dept is fairly large and I don't interact with most of my colleagues on a daily basis. 5) Interesting question, and actually I was thinking along the same line this morning. I got a job that's not TT but potentially gonna be permanent researh position, but I'm still looking for a faculty position, and in case I will have an on-campus interview, what would be my reasons to leave from work for 1-2 days? I think I like #2's suggestion as ""personal travel"". Also, a consequent question would be, how would you address question from the search committee that why are you applying for another TT job, when you already have one? @5, see """"horizontal"" job appplication"" thread below re: ideas of what to say to search committee 6) OP here, thanks for the responses. @4 good luck with your search, you'll get an interview soon! I like the suggestion about personal travel or invited seminar. I can see how relatively easy it could be to interview and be away if you are in a large departments, but smaller departments could be a little trickier, I think. I interact with everyone in my department on a daily basis and if I'm going for more than a half day people will start wondering. The department is very close and we all interact on a daily basis. Invited seminars would be one valid reason to be gone since I have done them before but deep down I feel like that is a little dishonest, even though a job talk goes on my cv as an invited talk.

NA,"General Am I the only one who is annoyed at the concept of ""trends"" in hiring?  This year, every university is hiring a ""Global Climate Change Ecologist"".  Last year, it was something else.  It seems that decisions on what field the department should focus is now based on the previous year's NSF funding trends, rather than departmental needs in teaching or research.   Get used to it. (2) OK. (3) I'm a bit cynical, but in most cases tenure depends on getting outside funding, so looking at NSF trends is reasonable. However, they're looking in the rear view mirror, so by the time we come up for tenure this will all be irrelevant. Personally, I'm annoyed with the trendiness in EEB in general. We tend to be whores to the current buzzword, whether it's genomics, global change, or going way back ESS's and competition. 
(4) You mean ESS's and competition aren't cool anymore? 
(5) Buzzword or not, it is what is getting funded, usually for a good reason, and you need to adapt.
(6) The problem is, like 3 pointed out, that SC's are hiring based on the past only.  Worse that that - hires not based on what has been increasingly funded, or what subjects are needed for training future ecologists, but on what was trendy in the last NSF cycle.  The result is that, in three years, there are dozens of mid-tenure faculty all in a subfield that is passe and won't be funded.  No so good for the faculty, nor for the departments who hired them.  Finally, funding for buzz-word science is not ""for a good reason"".  Seen any ground-breaking ecological research in fractals lately?  That was trendy not too far back.  Hire according to teaching needs, hire to match your departmental strengths, or, if you want a ""trendy"" hire, look at the publication and funding trends of the last 3-5 years, not at what was hot last June-July.

(1) faculty at my R1 told me that 9-month is typical as you're expected to have some salary from grants... one prof told me to budget on your 9-month salary so any additional income is 'gravy'.  I also just taught at a SLAC as a VAP, and the offer was for 9 months (2 semesters), but my pay was spread out over 12. (2) Most faculty at my University (TT and non) also get a nine-month salary paid over 12 months.  This is because you actually only work nine months out of a year, and it allows you to request summer salary as part of your grants.  I think that it is paid over 12 months to make budgeting easier. (3) This all misses the original point of the question, which is: why would an offer of 12 month be a possible negative, i.e. does a 12 month appointment mean you cannot receive summer salary from grants? (4)  My guess would be that if you are on a 12 month salary (i.e., you get paid for 12 months of work, rather than a 9 month salary paid over 12 months), then no, you cannot get summer salary from grants, since your University/College is already paying you for this time period.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Listing job talks on CV I've heard that it's ok to list job talks as ""invited seminars"" on a CV.

I know of a few cases, they were all 'superstars' and most of them had some connection to the new university (so that existing faculty approached their administration arguing for an ""Opportunity Hire"") x3 3) It's not uncommon for tenured folks to be invited to apply and interview for open positions elsewhere (often as part of a ""distinguished lecturer series""), but I've never heard of jobs being offered to people without some sort of competitive interview process. 4) When I was in grad school we hired a couple of senior 'superstars' away from other places and as far as I know none of them had anything like a competitive interview process. Maybe something like that happened behind the scenes, but certainly there was no widely advertised job opening with a series of interviews by candidates. My impression was that those people let it be know they wanted to leave and would consider moving to xx university (and already had some contacts there) and then the university just made it happen somehow. 5) I know of one person who got an unsolicited job offer as a first year asst prof, another with a poaching offer just around the time of tenure, and a tenured couple who were recruited together by another university.

NA,"Question In the anon survey, I noticed that the number of ""independent"" classes for many is quite high. I find this suspect (especially since most are postdocs) and I think that most people are counting classes they TA'd in grad. school. I assume independent to mean classes for which you were full instructor. What does everyone think? (1) I think that whole survey serves no purpose whatsoever. Comparing yourself against others' ""data"" will not tell you if you are or are not qualified to be on the job market; the job market will tell you that.

(5)  1, 2, and 3 are all right.  Top schools with large budgets will often do a general search, and pick those with the ""best"" CV's (lots of money and pubs, etc..).  However, smaller schools are usually looking for a specific thing:  somebody who will fit in well, who will teach specific courses, etc... In these cases, publication and grant records will not be as important as what you do and what skills you have.  Finally, searches can be totally wacky.  Remember that the hiring is done by a committee.  That should be enough to tell you not to expect a logical process.  It may also be worth your time to notice that there is not a strong correlation in the table between the qualifications and the number times people on the list have been short-listed or interviewed.
(6) Agree.  Whoever posted this, its worth little.  IN fact, the # of pubs and h-scores will be virtually meaningless because even within ecology and organismal biology there is huge variation in the citation rates among subdisciplines.  What is high for a herpetologist would be low for an ornithologist.  Some of this is simply how many journals and how many people work in the subdiscipline.

I'm not so sure there is any perfect school for a particular person. I think it's all about being able to find happiness wherever you are (especially the case in this market). Based on the general discussion, it seems like a lot of idealists on here go on 'feelings' about places without ever having been there or interacted with anybody at the place. No place is perfect, and if one looks hard enough they can find something they dislike about any department. Focus on the deal-breakers, what you absolutely can't put up with vs. what you can live with given the opportunity to do what you want. 4) I've been on interviews and have felt like they weren't the right fit, but felt guilty thinking so with the ""beggars can't be choosers"" mentality too. I got a job offer at one place and even though I'm still on the job market, have never regretted turning it down. Other places I've felt like I could thrive, but....didn't get the position.

I just have 1-2 sentences at the end of the first paragraph of my cover letter, which explain why I am excited about the specific job I'm applying for. It simultaneously allows me to bolster the idea that I'm a good fit for that particular position and hints at why I am looking to move. x2 3) As a grad student who sat in on several rounds of facutly interviews, a fairly short description of the interest on behalf of the TT faculty interviewing were generally enough. I don't recall anything in the application materials that said as much explicitly, but when the time came for face to face interviews, it was fairly easy to see who could explain their interest and who couldn't. 4) I agree with #2, and would just add that it will absolutely come up in the interview stage...in nearly every meeting. 5) Your approach is sensible: need to explain/hint your reasons in the cover letter. Otherwise they might not even interview you if they're worried you're just using them for leverage. And as others said, be prepared to elaborate in the interview if you get that far, because it *will* come up. 1) I wish I could just write ""FOR REAL GUYS, I WANT TO MOVE. FOR REAL.""",NA, 
NA,"Texas Schools update Anyone have any info on the # of applicants or any other info for the Texas positions (UTA, UTSA, UTT, Baylor, etc.)? anything??

They asked for my letters a week or two ago, but I don;t consider that a short list... (3) The SC contacted me (4) same here, SC emailed me. (5) 3 and 4, to which school are you referring?

(9) It's actually not dry at all. It's very very humid! I haven't heard anything about the bio department; it doesn't seem very ecology, evolution, etc. (EEB) focused at all. (10) So what? (11) It matters. They might be looking for someone to spearhead the eco/evo/behav/etc. focus. On the flipside, they might not!

(source: grad student).  (14) I can tell you that being the sole ecologist in a department full of lab biologists can be miserable. (15) I applied  to that position. My #1 fear of a position like that is exactly what is expressed by #14. (16) How do you do it #14. I've often wondered about this. How do you attract students, etc. ? (17) Has anybody heard any news or anything back from UTSA or UTA?(18) Nope. Heard through the vine that they met last Friday to decide the short list (despite what the above seekers stated). (19) I haven't heard anything from UTA (only a confirmation and LoR request). Heard that UTSA position was still up in the air due to status of funding. Can anyone else corroborate this? (20) Where did you hear that? I applied, made the short list, sent in additional requested materials, and am still waiting to here back from the SC. But, I'll echo what is being discussed above (here and earlier this week), if offered the position, it's going to be one long hard road being the LONE ECOLOGIST in THAT department.

If discussion needs to happen, I suggest posting in this tab. Thanks! x3 2) sounds like a first world problem to me.",NA,"chances without postdoctoral advisor rec letter A question for advice, perhaps others have had this issue: current postdoctoral advisor is temperamental and unpredictable. When asked at the beginning of the season for a rec letter, said ""of course"". Now that it is time to actually begin submitting letters (and advisor knows it will have to be for many schools), there is a very real possibility this person will simply not submit any of the letters by the deadlines (advisor travels often and does not respond to email at all).  So the question is: has anyone heard of situations where a postdoc landed a SLAC or R2 job after having been ghosted by their current postdoc advisor?  The only solution for the applications themselves (which almost all have only 3 slots for letters) would be to exclude the postdoc advisor and to replace with a different reference which knows them well, and the publication record is OK but nothing spectacular (including at least one published paper that has this postdoctoral advisor on it). 2) In that case you could think about the option in the question one row up...generic letters aren't ideal, but if you can get crappy advisor to put one generic letter (that you trust) into interfolio you could send it to every search without further involvement. 3) you don't need your postdoc advisor to be a letter writer. I just got a job offer without them writing me a letter. Also, generic letters are the norm, nothing ""not ideal"" about them. 4) Totally disagree, #4 - as clear from the line above, generic letters aren't the norm. I suppose it may be sub-field dependent. However, in the case of OP, I think a generic letter is better than no letter from the postdoc advisor. If you can't get it, though, I agree that you'll probably be fine. FYI - even when schools ask for 3 letters, you can often (though not always) give them 4 names/letters. In your case, I would do that whenever possible, assuming that at least 3 writers will submit their letters and hopefully the 4th (postdoc advisor) will as well. 5) Why would most large universities use generic letter services like interfolio then? An example: My advisor has six postdocs, let's say they had to tailor each letter (taking 1 hour each, conservatively estimating) for each of our 40 job applications (also a conservative estimate). That would be six weeks worth of work, each year, just for postdocs! That also doesn't include letters for the eight grad students, ten undergrads, and a lab tech. Generic letters are the norm. 6) Generic letters are most definitely not the norm in eco-evo departments, though maybe they should be. While interfolio does allow for submission of generic letters, it also allows you to request specific letters for each job and this is the way that it is normally used. Lots of people complain about the hundreds of letters they send. If they only had to write ~10 generic letters one time this would not be a big deal. To be clear though, by tailored I mean that the letter is addressed to the right department, uses the actual title of the job, maybe has paragraph order switched depending on type of school. I do not think that tailoring that gets into details of fit with initiatives of this department etc is common. 7) Changing the address isn't tailoring, what are you talking about? 6) @7, I agree that minimal tailoring is not that onerous (I'm not going to argue with you about whether to call it tailoring or not). It is certainly different though than a single letter that is stored in interfolio and sent to all jobs without even being addresssed to a specific university or job call (which is the way things are done in some fields and seems to be what some people are suggesting above). 8) So, you are saying you would rank a candidate lower because a reviewer didnt write your address on the letter? Cool. 9) Only in a labor market with so few jobs could there be this much narcissism 6) @8, lol, way to miss the point. @9, I agree!  1) Here: thank you for all the discussion and advice so far, I think my question highlights that there are very different approaches depending on the sub field: perhaps sub fields in which many postdocs are being supervised by a single advisor expect letters that are not tailored (and my guess is R1 jobs), but I am asking specifically for SLAC and R2, where some detail about how the person fits the place seems to be more important for the letter.  My question is therefore directed @ 3), was the job offer at a SLAC or R2??? If so I will breathe much easier for the applications which allow four references, and will send a series of pleading emails to this advisor for the positions that require 3 letters about two or three days before those deadlines. My impression is it would look very weird if I do not make the current postdoc advisor one of the 3 required letter writers, however. Perhaps others can chime in with their own experience?  ",NA, 
NA,"anon qual So far the respondents for the anon qualifications have all been very impressive, some with a dozen first author papers in a couple of years after graduation (along with all the Ivy leaguers). I'm just wondering if this is truely the mean these days, or is that the real ""average joes"" are just shying away from this survey? (1) I think it's a little bit of both. My hypothesis is that the average number of publications per job applicant has increased in recent years, although I have no data to support it. Also, everyone may not be interpreting # years in post doc as time since obtaining the PhD. (2) if you look at the survey and at the lists of interviewees at universities, you will see that there are fewer pubs per person, so I also think that the list includes the more productive members of our community. (3) how many of the publications are published abstracts and not full articles? (4) the more ""productive"" or the more lucky to have gotten into labs where multiple authorships on papers that came out of the lab were the rule and not the exception...(5) I put all first authorships on it, but if you check my list at Web-of-Science, the list is shorter because not everything ends up there. Maybe we should add a field so that people can add the impact factors (of the publication year) as a comma separated string, it might give a rather different picture. (6) How about an H-index? (7) I like that! (8) @6,7: Done (9) Those things are bunk! 
(10) Not bunk, but fairly irrelevant. SC's will not start computing your h factor, especially since many job searchers are relatively new, with many recent publications. So it is more likely that they will look at number of pub's and at both the impact factors and the relevancy of the journals to the field. In any case, the most important column there is grants. My observations are that any job searcher with a major grant (the more, the better) with only a few pubs is more likely to be invited for an interview and offered a job than a candidate with multiple pubs, but no grants. (11) Please tell me that the person who got a PhD in 2006 and has listed 9 (!!!) grants >$100,000 simply misread the column header or made a typo! (12) I don't know about 9 grants, but I personally have known people in Cons. Bio. who have gotten > $1,000,000 in grants within 2 years of their graduation. (13) a good resource beside Web of science is Hartzings Publish or Perish. It uses a larger database of pubs to calculate h and others, however, sometimes it picks up stuff that are not really pubs and may need deletion. Occassionally it incorrectly breaks up a paper, but for h this is usually not a factor that affects your rating. (14) It is 9 grants >100k, 1 over 1 million, 1 around 500k, and many others under 100l.  Its life on soft money.

Why or why not? I have at one or two places that heavily emphasize diversity, but otherwise haven't felt comfortable. 1) Who I sleep with does not affect my abilty to teach or do research. I am sure no one has disclose their status as straight in their applications. Even for a place that emphasize diversity, I would not want to get the job because they wanted a LGBTQ person on the faculty for diversity. 2) No, not anymore than I would do my race. I also don't put my photo on my CV, unless specifically requested (by some countries). If I get the interview, they will see my race and presenting gender. Perhaps during informal speaking (such as at a restaurant or café for dinner), information about me or my partner my come up in conversation. It would not bother me at all to benefit from diversity initatives, whether it was by race or other status. This is simply because usually diversity intiatives are seeking a member of a minority group who is also a stellar candidate and would be a great employee. These intitives know that we exist. 3) My sexual orientation (asexual) tends to be poorly understood by both straight and gay folks, so I don't disclose. I did use it effectively in a fellowship application that was based around diversity, though. 4) I disclosed to a younger faculty member during my on campus interview at a religiously-affiliated college.

It sounds like the best way to get a better deal for my spouse will be for us both to apply elsewhere and hopefully get offered another position as leverage. How soon after I start my job can I start this re-application process? Is it too soon to do so this year? I really like my new colleagues and my job, so I'm not looking to piss anyone off. 2) No advice- I just wanted to say hi, because I'm basically in an identical boat and I came to ask this same question. (OP- Hi, #2!) 3) Start now. No reason not to. It's just a job. It's not like you are cheating on your spouse. x4. They won't make any move toward a deal for your spouse until you have leverage, if it looks like you will leave or could leave imminently. Don't ever let your feelings for a place get in the way of you trying to improve your life. They'll never let their feelings get in the way of helping or making your life worse. Good luck. x2 4) Absolutely start now. They absolutely will not do anything unless they think you will leave (and then may not either as it depends on a confluence of factors as I am sure you are aware), so be fully ready to pack your bags and accept an offer elsewhere. I'll also add that although one or two colleagues may hold it against you, the vast majority will be on your side. 5) I agree with others that there is no reason not to start looking now, but also know that moving is hard and a lot of work, and a significant setback to your productivity and lab development. There is something to be said for timing it right, so that it is least disruptive. In my experience (moved after 3 years) it knocks you back anywhere from 6-12 months. You also want to time it right for when you AND your spouse are most competitive. If you are offered another job, but still nothing for your partner, then you really don't have leverage at all.  Even if you are both offered jobs, your current university may not be able to counter-offer (for various administrative reasons), and so be prepared for that. I agree that most people won't hold it against you, but if you threaten to leave, and then stay, most people also won't forget that. x2 6) Start now. The best opportunity for you in the next five years may be advertised this year. OP) Thanks for all the thoughts - #5's comments especially resonate with me. I understand the point that suitable jobs don't come up every year, and applying now is maybe a good idea. But it does take up a lot of time, it does piss some people off if they find out, and timing applications for both spouse and my cometitiveness seems like an excellent idea. All great points to consider, and many thanks for the input! 7) I don't get it. Appy. Now. Why are you so attached with this department that didn't give a shit to your spouse? I mean, you only got toknow them like few weeks!! Remember, this your honeymoon time & everyone is supposed to be extra friendly, and helping. That temporary fake thing shouldn't come to your mind while taking a life decision. And mind that, one you've offers for both, the present school, that you like so much, may even negotiate to keep you there. So, apply. Now. x2 8) I don't know about this idea that if you threaten to leave and stay people won't forget it. Maybe true for some people or some departments, but I think most people would understand exactly why you would do that. In departments I've been around this was super common at any time pre/post tenure. Some people got outside offers and ended up staying with retention packages and others left. One department specifically encouraged people to apply because they could justify salary bumps with outside offers. I can see being more selective in the first year or two, but as #6 says, the best fit might be this year and you only get so many shots before tenure. I'd apply.  9) In terms of the earlier comment that if you threaten to leave, negotiate a retention package, and stay; that people won't forget it.  Here is an example:  See this blog post on moving faculty positions, and point 8 by Dan Bolnick http://ecoevoevoeco.blogspot.com/2018/06/a-really-moving-blog-post.html 10) @9, would you take that link as evidence that applying outside had costs? I'd interpret it in exactly the opposite way. Despite having earlier applied elsewhere and gotten a big retention package, they were still willing to match salary after a second outside offer later. He also says 'UT' throughout and not his department, so it isn't clear that there were any negative ramifications (or any at all) within the department that would actually affect day to day work life. Sure, they didn't match everything he asked for the second time and he left for a better job, but where is the supposed cost of having applied and stayed? 11) #9, thank you for posting that link! It's really informative and interesting. #10 - I totally disagree. The tone that Bolnick takes is very much that it was a problem. It doesn't sound like he regrets his choices, but it does sound like there were ramifications and some people ""didn't forget"" and therefore became harder to deal with. Yes, maybe just admin people, but it's not totally clear. They were willing to negotiate salary, but as Bolnick puts it, ""just salary"" and nothing else.",NA, 
NA,"General Ok, some years ago, I asked several people about what they thought were the top 10 universities for EEB. How does that list look nowadays? I am sure people have different pictures, but I am curious if there is some overlap[ between those lists.  (1) I couldn't narrow it down beyond 12 (alphabetically): Arizona, Cornell, Duke, Harvard, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Princeton, Texas, U Washington, UC Davis, Wisconsin (2) I would not put Harvard up there in the top 10 by any measure, while U. Colorado would definitely be on the list, as well as Texas Tech. I also think that U Conn and Chicago U, would make the list, as well. While it is not in the USA, U Toronto is on par with these top schools. (3) Harvard is definitely up there (top 5 at least), along with Cornell and UC Berk. 
(4) Sorry, but if you rank graduate programs (I used phd.org) in Ecology by multiple factors (I only put in faculty achievements/reputation and quality of education), Harvard never is found within the top 10, 20, or even 30. Cornell is always there, UC Davis, SUNY Stony Brook, Princeton, Arizona, Indiana, Minnesota, Chicago, U. Michigan, UT Austin, and U Washington. U Georgia is up there, as is Columbia, U Conn, and U Louisville. You can also try to add low tuition and presence of minorities and women to the selection catagories, but somehow, I don't think that it would improve Harvard's ratings... (5) I agree that Harvard is not even close to the top 10. Harvard may have a reputation among the general public, but in terms of who matters in research activity, Harvard isn't in the conversation. Other than that, I agree with the top schools most people mentioned. I find the U. Louisville pick a bit odd. (6) Yeah, I agree, Harvard sucks. I applied for undergrad...REJECTED!, I applied for grad...REJECTED!, I applied to a postdoc there....REJECTED. Harvard is not even in the top 100. BOOOHH Harvard, BOOOHH Harvard!

(at least on the evo side, can't really argue with harvard...) its true some of the above made their fame at other places nevertheless.... (13) This is pretty funny. Yeah, who the heck are Wilson, Abzhanov, Haig, Gould, Pierce, and Giribet anyways? never heard of them!  (14)  Yep, Harvard is pretty good at hiring famous people after they've done the work that they became famous for.  So you have a department made up of Assistant Professors who will never get tenure at Harvard, but do all the work, and then there are a set of Famous Professors who write books and opinion pieces.  However, if going to Harvard makes you feel like a Superior Being, than have fun.  That and 3 bucks will get you a coffee at Starbucks.(15) All of the mentioned profs, except Abzhanov, are tenured and Gould is deceased. (16) And all were hired with tenure, after they had made themselves a name elsewhere (including Gould). (17) That's not true for all of them and the bottom line is that they ARE at Harvard now. (18)  Remember to tell us in a year or two how being at Harvard helped you get a job. (18) And the pissing contest continues. However, Harvard is hiring assistant professors. I collaborate with one. (19) But generally assistant professors do not get tenure.

At least, I have a hard time believing that people have already applied for 30-60 jobs in the 17-18 cycle!! Maybe we could add a column for year (total vs. 16-17 vs. 17-18) to make it clear what people are actually reporting. Not that it is the most useful page anyway, but if it is a mix of reports over different years and time periods I don't see the point of it at all. 2) Actually, yeah, what is the point of that tab? Am I supposed to be getting something constructive from it? 3) See your competition. So when someone doesn't gets an offer at an R1 with 2 pubs that person doesn't come on here and complain that the system is completely unfair. 4) <- that's a bit of a warped perspective.

The alternative is a complete lack of information, which isn't really any better. 8) Agree with number 7. In no way does the tab indicate that the data are used for any type of anayltical interpretation on standards you need to land a particular job. The data are there for you to interpret for yourself. Whether you think the data are meaningful is up to you. I am a firm believer that once you make a phone interview/campus interview quantitative comparative data like those on the Anon Quals tab are not that important.

Then, yes, good idea. 3) OP here: to clarify, it has been submitted but not accepted yet. I'd definitely rank it among my top 3 papers, though.   4) Attach it.  I know several people who got interviews because they did this, even when it wasn't posted on preprint servers. 5) If it's a great paper and it's in review, I think it's a good idea to include it. I did this when I was applying for jobs, and it worked out for me. My rationale was that search committees can find everything that's already published if they really want to - highlighting your newest, coolest stuff that they can't otherwise find seems like a good idea to me. (As long as you're not worried about getting scooped. but that seems very unlikely) 6) To add to this question, do people generally only include papers where they are first author? I have a review that was just accepted where I am third author, but actually contributed quite a bit to it and think it's one of my better pieces. 7) I wouldn't submit a paper that I wasn't first or senior author on. 8) I agree - all main papers should be first-authored. If it's possible to append another paper (sometimes they ask for papers collated into a single PDF, in which case four instead of three is very possible), a Science/Nature/PNAS junior-authored paper would be reasonable.",NA, 
NA,"spreadsheet On the new anon qualifications spreadsheet, why do candidates think it's relevant if their PhD or postdoc was at an Ivy. I have two postdocs at Ivys but I think it's irrelevant so left it off. (1) Because they are hoping employers will think it's relevant. (2) because they think they are better than you (3) I actually find it amusing, since in ecology/evolution, most of the Ivies are fairly low. The E&E program at, say, the University of Michigan, is much better than any Ivy except Princeton. An ecology PhD from Harvard or even Yale ain't all that impressive. (4) I agree with 2. (5) #3 feel free to check out the Cornell EEB webpage and compare it to UM. Also, while Dartmouth is small, the faculty with an EEB focus is excellent. I'm not saying being at an Ivy makes someone impressive, but at least do your research before you make a broad statement like that. 5) Where you got your degree is not really relevant as anyone in EEB knows. Even if you got your degree, e.g., at Cornell EEB, it won't matter if you don't have many publications. Bottom line is that people are going to judge you by the quantity and quality of your publications. 7) Anecdotally graduates from R1 schools tend to have more pubs than someone from regional universities. Of course there're always exceptions, but the trend seems to be that way. Despite how much we academics want to think that we are enlightened, we are still humans, so sometimes name can still carry some weight, especailly if all other credentials are comaprable between two candidates. You don't see anyone bragging about obtaining their degree from a regional university here, do you? 
(8)  Ivy graduates brag about their University because most have drank the coolaid, and it has been hammered in their head that it is important.  In all my career as an ecologist, I have yet to see that where you got your PhD from made the slightest difference in a job search.  On the other hand, it IS important who your ADVISER is.  Ultimately, though, it seems that what determines whether you are selected for an interview at a Research university is (in order of importance): 1. grant $$$, 2. publications, 3. who wrote your LoR's, and 4. experience (teaching & research).  For a teaching university (LAC, etc..), they're likely to also attach high importance to teaching awards and if you did your BSc at a LAC.  Where you did your PhD will, per se, have little effect, except at some Ivy's which like to hire Ivy graduates.  Nobody else cares. 9) I think #8 got it totally right. Grant money and publications matter most along with who your PhD advisor was. I think those folks that are arguing that where you got PhD factors into a decision obviously have not been involved with a job search. Committees are unlikely to even bring up where you got your PhD from. (10) Yeah I agree with 8 and 9 and 3, and 5.

Go for it but try to stay calm while the committees make their decisions. 7) Depends on how high profile of a position it is, and how amazing your CV is. It's not likely to be the best use of your time if you're looking at a major R1 university and you don't have an incredible CV. 8) I found it incredibly helpful to apply even if I didn't think I had a shot. This is because I had to get my stuff together and really start thinking about the narrative to describe who I am and what I do. That sounds pretty simple, but as an ecologist with a diverse set of research interests, it was difficult at first and I only got better (I hope) the more times I had to rewrite my materials. 9) If nothing else, your materials next cycle will benefit from the time you spent putting in the effort now.",NA,

Death in the family This past monday, my father died unexpectely and I immediately flew home to help with the arrangements and support my mother. Tomorrow (Friday) I have a phone interview for my top-choice school. I am planning to go ahead with the interview, since that seems easier than trying to reschedule the interview for a time when all the committee will be together and also this will be my fourth phone interview so I am well practiced to answer all the standard questions. However, my question is to whether I should bring up my unusual circumstances. For example, if I am asked about what what challenges I have had to overcome, I could mention that I am still coordinating my long-term projects in my absence. However, I don't want to be a dramatic pity case or show that I am uncommitted to my job. I also don't want to make the interview too personal or bring up feeling that the committee members might have about their own parents or their own work-life balance. One person suggested simply emailling the chair of the committee to give her the details, but refraining from mentioning it during the interview. What advise do people have regarding this?",NA,"Non-academic Spousal Accommodation? Has anyone tried to work out a spousal accommodation for a spouse that isn't an academic? My spouse has a grad degree in counseling and would be interested in a res life type of job and they have delayed their career to allow me to pursue postdocs. It seems like a non-TT position would be easier to work out as a spousal hire, but I have no idea TBH. Thoughts? 2) I have no personal experience, but I have colleagues and aquantances that managed similar spousal accomodations. On the whole, I think it's probably easier than tenure track or even non-tenure track faculty lines... 3) Like 2, I know people who have done similar kinds of things, though I'm not sure that the second position was really negotiated in the initial TT hiring or just figured out afterward. If you are at a big school and flexible it does seem like there are more openings and more turnover in those res life/counseling type jobs so there is more chance of one working out than another TT job that just happens to fit a particular area of research. And those searches tend not to be national in the same way as TT searches. 4) I have two experiences with this. In both cases both were negotiated as being given 'serious consideration' for a job opening. But, there had to be a job opening (ie. in neither case did they create a new job). One position was in Project Management and the other case was in the Advising Office. Basically, the spouse identified the job opening (through the HR job postings), the faculty member alerted their Chair, who alerted the appropriate person to 'flag' their application to at least be looked at. 5) I tried and it didn't work, but it wasn't a deal-breaker for us. There wasn't anything obviously suitable either. I know people for whom it did work but it was a high priority. My limited-experience advice is to try after fully considering this issue as one of your suite of negotation topics and knowing where it fits in your priorities. If it's #1, then push hard and let them know that. Also I've been told repeatedly that you should let the SC know as soon as possible (like, casually in your interview) if this is your situation so that they can have time to look into how to accomodate you. I think that's good advice, but know some folks won't be comfortable revealing any family details. 6) Unlike #5, I have heard that you should NEVER mention this at the interview stage - only once you have an offer. I have no personal experience with this, though. 7) Agree with #6 - I think it's a terrible idea to mention this during the interview. It should have absolutely no bearing on whether you get the job or not, and in almost every case, giving them a jump on creating a position for your spouse shouldn't matter. Negotiations can last for months, so there should be no problem starting the spousal negotiations once the job offer has been made. 8) Maybe it's your turn to allow them to pursue their career. 1) Thanks for taking time to give us some thoughtful feedback @2-7!

These are obviously teaching-focused, but can these faculty members also advise students and do some research? 2) Quite a few places in the US have essentially the same things (often called 'professor of the practice'. I think the extent to which you can do research and advise students can vary a lot from place to place, but my impression is that it would be more typical to do things like co-advise students than to really have your own resaerch lab with your own students. 3) Canadian research uni prof here. Here at my uni, faculty with exclusively teaching duties have no research labs, don't do research (except pedagogical research in some cases, which is looked on favorably), don't ordinarily serve on grad student committees (need to get special permission to do so), and thanks to their heavy teaching loads do not have time to do research ""on the side"" even if they wanted to (although they can supervise undergraduate honors student research). Also, in my admittedly-anecdotal experience, search committees for these positions are keen to hire people who are 100% committed to teaching. They are reluctant to hire people who would rather do research, or a mix of teaching and research, out of fear that those candidates will decline the offer/leave for a research position after a year or two/not be fully committed to their teaching duties. But such details may vary somewhat from place to place; I don't know. 4) Tenure-track teaching faculty in Canada here. I serve on numerous student advisory commitees. I can hold grants and supervise my own students (with permission, which is basically guaranteed). I am not required to do those things, but I can get a teaching reduction for doing so. Also, mechanisms are in place for changing into a research-based professorship. YMMV based on the university, but I would recommend not overlooking one of these teaching professorships unless you really aren't interested in teaching at all. They are at least worth inquiring about. However, I suspect that as a US citizen you are at a serious disadvantage for any such positions. Immigration law requires that Canadian citizens be given priority. Research positions will sometimes go out to superstar Americans, but I imagine that for a teaching position, this is harder to justify. 5) Thank you number (4), that was some great information.

My due date is near the time when I imagine they will want to conduct onsite interviews.

What obligation (if any?) does the institution have to accommodate me?  The position wouldn't start until next fall, so my pregnancy has no bearing on my future employment (I.e.- I won't need maternity leave).  Advice? (1) I think the most important thing is to interview when you are capable of best representing yourself.  I'd push it until as late as possible after the birth of your baby.  I interviewed when my daughter was 2 months old, and it was fine.
(2) I would wait to mention the pregnancy until they invite you for a campus interview -you don't want to give them any reason not to invite you!
(3) True, but at the same time search committees may have a limited time to make a hiring decision.  Out of consideration, maybe you would want to tell them so that they can make arrangements and plan the interview schedule ahead of time.  
(4) Since the SC will not be planning the interview until they have invited people for the interview, there still is no reason at all to tell the search committee anything about the pregnancy unelss they invite you for an interview.

Try to leave the institution with as many allies as possible.  Best of luck out there. 2) Oh no, what did I do this time? 3) where is this coming from 4) I am not the OP, but one of the search committee from a job I didn't get later became an NSF program officer. Super super useful to know them, agree with this post. 3) Same should be told to them. I got an interview a few months ago, everyone in the depatment/search committe was super nice; the new hire started on July 1st (heard from a colleague), I have not been notified that I didn't get the position, not even that they offered the job to someone else. I feel really resentful towards the search committee. Really, they only needed to send three emails (one for each of the rejected candidates): thank you so much for your visit, nice meeting you, we offered the position to someone else, good luck. Is that too hard? I don't think so. X2 5) same exact thing happened to me, never notified that someone else was hired, and they basically offered me the job on the interview. I was bitter, but just anther sign that I deserve better than academia. It hurts to be treated like trash. 6) As a general rule, I have found (and heard similar reports from others) that schools and faculty will basically pretend like you have the job at an interview. At one interview, I was told how much to ask for in start-up (not theoretically if I got the job, but as if I was surely going to be requesting start up at that school). Whatever the reason for this, I think it's important for interviewees to remember that you will NEVER be offered the job at the interview stage for academic jobs. This may be different for other types of jobs in other fields, but it can be disconcerting and feel really bad to get a rejection if you aren't prepared for this experience.

If you call, you'll get the straight truth, since there's no record of phone calls.

And I'm quite sure opinions vary, but I promise you that most of the SC members I've personally worked with feel the same. I can usually tell just by reading the cover letter and glancing at the CV whether an app will make the first cut. And if I decide they aren't a great fit based on those documents I rarely even look at the rest of the app. Make sure your cover letter is stellar. 10) Agree with others that the cover letter is very important. Also, we did a little poll last year and found most letters were ~700 words. 11) They shouldn't matter, but they often do. 12) Why shouldn't a cover letter matter? All pieces of the application package should matter - they all contain pertinent information. It would be a disaster to hire people based on CV alone. x2 13) At heavily research-oriented universities cover letter are ignored.

We asked the candidate ""why do you want to leave industry for academia, and why are you confident you'd succeed as an academic?"" We also asked questions that assessed the candidate's knowledge of the funding environment, the concreteness of the candidate's research plans and program, etc. If you're ever going to move from industry back to academia at a research uni, you'd better have compelling answers to questions like these. Answers like ""My company's downsizing, I want more job security"" are not compelling (that's a made-up example answer). 7) On a related note, I'm considering a research position at a botanical garden.

Is it appropriate to add conference presentations and posters to my CV if I wasn't the presenter/first author? I have collaborators who presented our work in my absence, but I'm in the author list of the conference papers. I also have several students who presented (I was senior author and present). Is it appropriate or is it just padding? 2) I'd leave them off. In my experience, there is often a pretty low bar for inclusion of ""co-authors"" on conference presentations (perhaps because the study touches on several projects and we want to avoid offending people). Even if all authors contributed to the underlying study, the presentation/poster are typically prepared solely by the presenting author. I don't even know how many presentations I've been a co-author on - my colleagues usually don't ask. x2 3) I leave them on. Shows that you are collaborative and shows some other projects that you are working on. Plus, also provides some more names that someone from a search might recognize and connect you with...of course, that's a catch-22. 3) Evidence of successful mentoring of students is definitely relevant, so there's a vote for adding them.  4) Only include presentations that are not your own if they have conference proceedings published-- those are equivalent to papers in a lot of fields.  I would be very careful to distinguish mentees presentations if you do include them.  If you have supervised lots of undergrad research there's a case for listing their presentations, but only in a separate section that is clearly defined.  You do NOT want to look like you are trying to pass off other people's presentations as if they are your own. x2  5) I include ones where the presenter is a student I mentored and note clearly with a big asterisk that this is an undergrad or grad mentee. x2 2) I take it back. I like #5's idea. I highlight mentee first-author papers on my CV 6) If I were looking at the CV and saw lots of mentee's presentations listed, I'd wonder where the publications to go with them were.

If you look at last year's list there were 14 jobs by this date with 'evolution' in the title vs. 12 right now (I know not a perfect assessment, someone could do better by reading the descriptions more carefully but that is beyond my level of procrastination right now). For 'ecology' (admittedly even more vague) there were 39 on this date last year and 53 this year. The total job list this year is longer by this date though (146 vs. 122), so maybe it just seems like there are fewer jobs because they are mixed in with so many that aren't good fits? I do watch evoldir and ecolog and relevant jobs on both of those listservs are nearly always on this board immediately after being posted there or even before they are advertised there.

Past 3 years got 3 campus interviews but no offer yet. Be honest about your opinion please. Thanks! 2) I assume you mean it has been 7 years since you got your PhD? Yes, that might seem like you are ""getting old"" academically to some universities, but I personally doubt that that is why you wouldn't get a job. I've heard of many cases of people getting jobs 5, 6, or 7 years after their PhD. Of course, I think you have to show what you've been doing all that time, but it sounds like you have been. 3) I am in similar boat as OP, but fewer pubs total (however first author Nature this year). Can't say if it will work out, but my referees all seem to think it's about fit/luck (I am in between disciplines in a particularly unusual way). Good luck to us oldies! 4) Sounds familiar to me too...>5 years post PhD and only 3 campus interviews. I have >30 pubs mostly in very good journals and more than half first authored, but maybe lacking a single super high profile pub and also somewhat between disciplines. @3, if your first author Nature paper doesnt help then I don't know what will! 5) Same here: 7 years after PhD (2 as teaching faculty, and then a 5-year research postdoc).  More than 30 papers and I am in-between disciplines as well.  This year I applied to >40 jobs already, and so far been invited to one interview in the UK that will be in a few weeks.  I was told that years from PhD is more of an issue in the ECO-EVO field, while it is not a problem in the genomics/molecular biology field, and more in general in biomedical research in which very long postdocs are the normality 6) I agree with many of the things said previously, but especially that the importance depends on the sub-field. WIthout having seen your CV, or knowing your subfield, I would say that it's slightly concerning that you've only had 3 interviews in the last three years, unless you were being very selective about your applications. Given the long odds we are all up against when we enter the job market, you really need to be getting a large number of interviews to help your chances. You may want to a) apply much more broadly, and/or b) have someone have a look at your CV and cover letter and see if maybe there is something about your application materials that could be improved to get more interviews. 7) and c) try switching up your rec letters.  Apply to at least 1 job with each combination of your recs.  A bad or wishy washy letter will tank you, even with 30 papers. 8) OP here. Thanks all so far for your comments. My response specifically for #6 is that I had 3 CAMPUS interviews in past 3 years, but atleast 20-25 phone/skype interviews. I get postdoc offers often times, last time I was in the job market 2 years ago, I had 4 offers for postdoc. But when it comes to faculty positions, I noticed that after phone/skype interviews they go silent many times, and I saw it numerous times that the search was filled without even any campus interviews. Maybe not initially right after Ph.D, but past 3 years my interview performances have been superb (no brag here). I still don't get campus interviews for faculty positions (only 3 so far). As far as my CV is concerned, I was told by independent faculty members that it is VERY strong, and very close for a faculty profile. I often times hear from employers (for postdoc position) that whether or not I leave them soon with a faculty position. 9) Phone interview and then silence is actually pretty common.  Consider that usually even 20-30 people are interviewed by phone/skype, while only 3-5 are invited on campus.  So it makes sense that only a few of your phone interviews then resulted in a on campus invitation 6again) OP, I think you and I are thinking about a different thing when I say have someone look at your CV/cover letter. I'm thinking more about how one presents the CV and cover letter to highlight how you personally are well-suited to the particular position you are applying for. I think you are thinking more that your accomplishments, as represented in the CV, are at the level appropriate for a faculty position. If you are getting that many phone interviews without on-campus interviews, it might also be good to focus on your technique for those. I'm sure you could find a mentor to do a mock video interview with you and provide honest feedback. 10) Current faculty member here. I have seen folks get a position after >10 years of postdoc and at a very good R1 too. I think it is pretty common in our field to have a long postdoc. >5 years are the norm. That being said, I see a lot of discrimination against folks who did a long postdoc and gotten lots of publications. In faculty meeetings hiring decisions were made, I have heard other faculty members favor candidates with short postdocs and few papers but show ""promise"" or ""potential"". My two cents' advice is to keep trying. But when you get a phone interview / campus interview, show a lot of enthusiasm and really prepare for the interview. I have also seen candidates with long postdocs and good papers but tanked at the interview stage because they did not prepare well. 11) OP (#1) here. #9, and #10: Those were legit questions/concerns. So, let me give you my experience or, performance in those 3 on campus interviews so that you know how I did. The first one was really from a very small school, and little bit off my expertise area, but I was told that I was the 1st candidate, and faculties ranked me highest among 3 candidates they were interviewing. Honestly, I didn't like the tiny department, and the expertise didn't match very well as well, and so I underperformed. Honestly, I think I blew it, but then search chair told me that the next 2 candidates would be coming to the campus after 1.5 months, and because of the time gap my performance might be even forgotten, and they might pick one of those remaining candidates. Either way, I didn't get the job, and when I checked who they picked, I figured that I was right that the candidate they picked was from different background, and his expertise is not well matched with the courses he has to teach. But in any case, I knew I didn't do well in the first case. The second on campus interview was in a very very high ranked R1 school (did I say ""very""?). I was their 3rd candidate. It was a blast. I over performed both days in 2 presentations. And after returning I was pretty much sure I'd get the offer. However, after 3 weeks they said that faculties could not ""decide"", and they have to reopen the search, and countinue to find a candidate appropriate job. Till today, they haven't offered the job to anybody (> 6 months) according to their websites, and my HR portal still says ""In progress"". The third on campus happened recently, and it was also a high standard R1 (not as well ranked as the second one). I was their first candidate. My teaching demo (second day) was excellent, but the next day research presentation (third day) wasn't that excellent, but overall good in my opinion. the reason behind that was I was exhausted by then as I was their 1st candidate, and they kept me on campus for 4 long days (means more meals, and interviews, repeated interviews with the same faculties, more tours, and interviews, more scrutiny, and more vetting than the other 3 canidates who visited them after me, but for much shorter time ~ 1.5 days). After 6 weeks of my return they said they decided to offer the position whose research experience/skill/direction were better matching with departmental needs. When I asked one of their faculty members (not in the search committee), they said they ranked me ""highly"" overall, and thought I did extremely well, but search committee might have felt that the chosen candidate might be the best fit. 12) I got my first job offer 7 years after receiving my PhD, after two postocs, in my second year of full-press faculty job applications. I think this is becoming more common. 13) Here's when recently-hired TT N. American ecologists got their PhDs: https://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2018/01/04/when-did-newly-hired-n-american-tt-ecology-faculty-get-their-phds/. 7 years post-PhD would be unusual but definitely not unheard of (but contrary to an earlier comment, 3-4 years post-PhD is most common; >5 years is above the mean and median). Broader context aside, if you're getting on-campus interviews, you're very competitive for the sorts of positions for which you're applying. 14) Chin up, I know it's frustrating especially since you sound very successful and hig-achieving.  One of my friends just got a TT job after 10 years of searching.  It took me five years.  There just aren't that many positions.  At the level of intervewing you are doing, it's really a matter of ""fit"". I had only six interviews, one I really wanted (went to a good friend, so that was awkward for a few weeks!).  But I will never forget when I interviewed for my current position, the faculty member came into the lobby to pick me up at the hotel.  I took one look at him, exhaled, my shoulders dropped and I relaxed.  I felt like here is someone I could work with for the next 20 years.  And after that good start, I continued to be relaxed and was able to interact with all the rest of them. It's been three years and I still like (most) everyone I work with!  Amazing! So maybe at your next interview, really think about are these the people I want to run into at the mail room every day?  Hope that helps. 15) the bigger question is, ""will you get a job that you actually want?"" Or will you just desperately take whatever you can... if it's the second option, then get out of academia now. ",NA,

I've acquired quite a few (>20) successful applications from people I know at this point and just over half of them have at least one figure in their research statement. It does seem like people who go with longer research statements tend (need?) to have some figures. The range in length is really surprising and again I've heard different advice here. Some successful applicants at R1s are just one page and others are 4+. I'm trying to shorten mine this year, but that also means cutting out some figures that I had in the previous version. Who knows if it'll help... 4) I think it definitely helps, if it can show some key aspects of your research. Most apps I've seen have 1 or 2 figures. 5) I used to include them but shortened my statement to 2 pgs and got rid of them. I won't say that had anything to do with my getting more interviews (probably a paper coming out mattered more), but I did get more interviews after. I think it really just depends on how much they add versus distract from your overall message/research identity. Also they have to be super easy to understand if you use them, and I'd say not to use someone else's figs with a citation, but I've seen people try it. 6) I think a simple, well-placed, attractive figure can be really nice, especially for the weary search committee member who has already looked at 50 applications and is not even close to halfway done.

It is my understanding that there is no chalk talk?  Also do you know if they usually provide any help for spouse relocation? 2) American here who's interviewed 3x in the UK, all 7-15 years ago. Congrats on your interview. Often, all candidates are interviewed the same day (sometimes you even meet the other candidates, sometimes not). You give a short research seminar (often 15 min; I've never heard of longer than 30 min), usually just to the search committee but sometimes it's open to others (including the other candidates, in one of my interviews!). Then after your seminar the search committee interviews you for about 45 min. There likely will also be a tour of the facilities, and some one-on-one meetings with other faculty. Never got a UK offer so can't speak to coverage of relocation costs, spousal hires, or other aid for spousal relocation. I suggest asking the search commmittee chair how the interview will be structured. And if they're willing to fly you over and you're able to go, I'd suggest going. It'll help you decide if it's a position you'd want to take if it was offered to you. 3) I (US citizen) interviewed 3 times in the UK and EU last go-around and will not apply to those positions again this year. Interesting experience but not at all what I was looking for re: academic culture. Go a couple days early to get over jetlag and see the sights. And definitely have a REF strategy (or at least know what it is). Based on the interview questions, I felt like I was mostly being judged on my paper outputs and impacts, not so much on teaching or unique research vision, etc. You can also use the opportunity to network with your competitors, who you will likely interact with. On the plus side, these kinds of interviews are 1000% less exhausting than the 3-day-long affairs of US departments and will quickly tell you (often on the same day) whether or not you got the job. Startups are typically minimal (if one is provided at all), and relocation expenses are provided but not enough to cover all expenses from US. 4) O.P. here.  Thanks everyone for the support! Interesting to hear that they often let you know if you got the job on the very same day of the interview.  Do you know if is it a standard to let the candidate some time to decide to accept the offer, like it happens here in the U.S.? 4) Yes they will, but the timeframe is shorter (a month max) and desired start dates are less likely to be deferred in the case of ongoing postdoc commitments, etc. Second visits can also be arranged in some departments. 5) I'm European, and I've had some UK interviews during the last years, some very recently, both in top universities (as top as you get, really), and some bottom ones, and the whole interview process is not that different between them, really. I agree with most of the comments given here. The process is quite simple and things can move very quickly indeed. I recently had a Skype interview (10 min presentation plus 30 min formal interview) and they offered me the job based on that, without me putting a foot in their place. To answer one of your initial questions, ""spouse relocation"" is not something you hear about in the UK. In general, there is little if any negotiation. You get your salary (again, not much negotiation there), one office (some times shared with someone else), a table and a chair, a computer, and little else. I guess because their investment on you is relatively low (compared to the US), they don't need to spend days checking you out and making sure that they make the right choice. A positive, though, is that in most cases you get a permanent job from the beginning, so you don't need to worry about getting tenure. 6) O.P. here. Thanks for the advice everyone! 7) The permanent job thing is starting to change, but it will be clear from the ad. 7) I've had two interviews in the UK in the past few years. For the most recent one, the startup offered with the position is smaller than in the US. However, things like computers are provided by the department and labs tend to be shared. It seemed like there was an assumption that I would not need to completely outfit a lab on my own. In general, I have been told that in the UK there is less concern about a candidate's research overlapping with someone else in the department, although at my recent interview I was asked how my research differs from someone in the department who falls into the same type of ecology as part of my research.",NA,

I know this happens, but I have very little idea of how common this is in the current job climate.  Would love general feedback from anyone with experience or insight. x2 2) My experience = zero success in a couple of tries. I've talked to lots of academic spouses about this and most have said that it is really just a numbers game. One person with a lot of experience told me that she figured that on average you needed 6+ offers per spouse to make something work (obviously more of an anecdote than real data). I also know several couples who made it work on their first job offer...so I guess it comes down to luck and how competitive you both are. 3) I don't really think it comes down to how competitive both are, at least in my experience at R1s. It's always been more of, is one a rock star, and will the other be able to get tenure. 4) I was a spousal hire this past year and was able to negotiate a tenure-track position and a very competitive start-up package at a big R1. But, at the time of negotiations, I had two other offers from good institutions, which I think helped a lot. Having said that, these other two places were not willing to negotitate a position for my spouse (even though we also were using other offers as bargaining chip). Anyway, it might be a numbers game, but from my experience it comes down to (i) how competitive both spouses are and (ii) whether the institution recognizes the value of academic couples (i.e., do they have designated programs to support partial salary and start-up, etc.). 2 again) Agree with #4. I mostly meant that it was a numbers game in the sense that it is very hard to know what institutions will recognize the value of academic couples. Only a few have official policies on their websites (I've looked for a lot and not found many), but some have a culture of never doing them or of going out of their way to make them work. I think there are some broad generalities in terms of the types of institutions or locations that are more likely to do them, but those generalities aren't really all that predictive either in my experience. 5) Relevant piece in Science Careers today: http://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2018/06/until-academic-careers-do-us-part 6) After getting an offer at an R1, I asked for (but didn't really expect) a tenure track position for my spouse. That didn't come through, but a good, non-tenure track position that will allow my spouse to continue publishing did. The wisdom from all the faculty there was that there would be no spousal TT position unless both parties had offers elsewhere. 7) I was a spousal hire and from my perspective our success was due to two things. First, I was competitive in the job market, meaning that I had good papers coming up, and I was interviewing for jobs in my own area. Second, there were a couple of people leaving the institution due to personal issues, and the department would have available money to hire me. That being said the process wasn't easy. Interviewing for a job as a solo is not the same as being presented as the spouse, there is a lot more pressure to perform, and departments have a lot more of expectations given that your partner has done so well. There are also compromises you would have to make in terms of research and teaching, since the department was not looking out to hire you. In my case one of us had been in the job market for 3 years, and the other one 2 years (without offers), so we had about the same experience doing on-campus interviews and that helped a lot in the way we navigated the spousal hire process. 8) I was a spousal hire but got only a 2 year post-doc out of it even though the college docked my spouse's pay due to my hire. I would recommend that you stand firm on the sallary negotiations if the spousal hire is very clearly temporary. 9) I was in the same situation as 8, but they were able to bump up my spouse's startup package and take my postdoc $ from that instead of his salary - something to consider if you end up in the same boat.

I heard that an inside candidate was already hired at said school, and that due to regulations, the department is simply going through the motions again.  Is it fair to ask the search committee chair if there is an inside candidate.  While I would like to be at school X, I don't believe its fair to me or my references to waste our time so the search committee can go through the motions and declare a ""fair search"".  Any suggestions on how to approach this. First, to paraphrase, a rumor is as good as the paper it's written on.  In any case, as far as I know, a department may hire somebody for TT without a search, especially if they've an inside hire in mind, and don't need to fake a full search to do this.  So, unless your friend is the departmental chair or the SCC, I would assume that the search is open.  As for an inside hire?  The SC may like you better.  Unless the inside hire is a genius or the provost's brother-in-law, you have a fighting chance.

I have great, pretty much equivalent offers from both. At one institution, I was an internal candidate. I ended up with an offer, but after a long process of departmental deliberations. The departmental vote was strongly favorable toward my candidacy, but not unanimous (I did not expect it to be). I have been at the institution through my PhD, postdoc (completely changed fields, however), and current position as NTT faculty. The other position is at a brand new institution with a fabulous department. Here's my difficulty. My entire family (parents) and my husband's family (parents, sister, niece/nephew) live very close to my current location. I have two kids, so this is fantastic. The other institution is in another state. Any thoughts on considering family versus the appeal of starting somewhere new (without departmental baggage from being an internal candidate)? Advice appreciated! 2) Are these both TT positions? Sounds like the deciding factor here should be where you're most likely to be successful in getting tenure. When you compare the start-up, facilities, potential for collaborations within the department, potential for students to achieve publishable research outputs, etc., where do the institutions rank? The worst possible scenario here is not moving away from family, but not getting tenure. 1) Thanks, #2. Yes, both are TT. All details are pretty much equivalent, including startup, salary, facilities, collaborations, departmental support, etc. Some small differences, but nothing substantial. Both institutions are R1 level medical schools. I have successful NIH grant history and am currently on track to securing R01 funding within the first year or two (fingers crossed). 3) I'd stay near family, if it was me. I regret the distance I have placed between me and my family from grad school to professorship. Not that seeing new places and meeting new people were not fun, but now I pretty much live permanently at a place for potentially 30+ years over 1,000 miles away from family. I didn't really think about it this way when I was in my pre-professorship training. Taking on a new position was just a 2 years here, 4 years here, 2 years here, etc...type of a deal. It really slaps you in the face once you get tenure at a place and you might not move from. Anyways, it's not bad. I travel a lot for work and to see friends/family, but it's definitely not ideal. 4) Congratulations on both offers. I would take the one at the new place. New place = new ideas = new beginning. I know it is far from family, but the old place would still treat you like a ex-student, and ex-postdoc and now an internal candidate (too much baggage). Well also depending on the city and state. Right now some places are getting redder and some places are getting bluer. Depends on where you want your kids to grow up as well. 5) Would absolutely choose the one close to family all else being equal. New people is exciting for a bit, but then you're likely to be there a long time and family doesn't change... 6) I chose family proximity over career, and I haven't regretted it. As a parent and a spouse, it made the most sense and gave me peace the jobs didn't. Being that far away as a postdoc made it clear for me. Either way, congratulations on having great offers. 7) Have two kids myself, live near family, turned down multiple out of state job offers for this exact reason. To me, the family support has been invaluable (economically and personally). If comparable and you like the dynamic generally in your current department I would say take that job. 1) Thank you all! I really appreciate hearing your perspectives! 8) What is the nature of the baggage-- is it only that you were previously not a prof, or is there more to it? If you can survive and rise above the baggage for a few years, then baggage smaggage. Any place you go you will have baggage within a few years.  9) Not even close, take the one close to family.

I just had the worst conversation w/the dept chair about salary negotiations. This is our first exchange after the interview, in which he was great. I'm female & they really low-balled me on the first offer (even if that's normal for them, it was super low for an R1). So I asked what they can do, told him what the 4 recent hires I know got as a first offer (a lot more) and the chair got all huffy about me asking, says he has to go to the administration and I asked him to do so to see what we could get done. He talked over me a bunch, didn't let me speak, was very aggressive, and essentially threatened to go to 2nd and 3rd candidates. I'm not sure what's wrong with just asking him to ask (they can always say no!). Is this normal? I have no idea what to do now. I guess just wait. It was so unpleasant! 2) Can you look up salaries of current faculty online? Or ask some recent hires what they got? 3) 1 here; I found a few wildly different estimates from a newspaper but also from the uni a doc with salary averages by department and trends over time--those are very obviously much closer to what other people are offered elsewhere and much higher than my offer. So I sent an email with that info and basically am asking for the equivalent of average Asst Prof at that uni from 2 years ago, even though it's lower than peer unis (who are themselves attempting to increase salaries). Just not sure why this ask was enough to cause such an apoplexy. My ask is totally in keeping with the salaries of first offers for R1s on the negotiations page. Also note this person hasn't been a chair long. But I don't have anyone else to negotiate with, clearly. As a woman, I felt like he was offended and wanted to railroad me into signing the original offer! 4) First, congrats on the offer, but sorry about your situation here. How did the other parts of the negotiation go (e.g., start-up, research associate support, GRA support, summer salary, etc.)? Did something happen in that part of the negotiation that made the salary stuff more awkward? Lastly, you may not want to answer here, but do you think the negotiation would negatively affect your ability to work with the chair if you take the position? 5) If it's a public R1, there really should be an online database of salaries, usually housed on a newpaper site. It may be hard to find though. In my mind, ~78 to 90 is typical for a new assistant prof at an R1, which is consistent with the negotiations tab on the previous 2017-18 file. 6) #1 again. Thanks for your thoughts #4 & 5, and the congrats. Yes, 78-90 does seem typical #5, but this is MUCH lower than that. More like SLAC. I suggested mildly that equity/parity was important to me, that 79 was typical at peer institutions; this precipitated threats to go to other candidates. The rest of the negotiations were also bad. Got ""we'll see"" on a 2nd visit (my first ask),and I didn't push past first offer on GRA, summer salary (3 mos over 2 yrs is ok). We didn't even get to start up or the seeming bump in teaching requirements they put in relative to what I was told at my interview. Didn't ask for my start up request. I sent it anyway with the email backing up salary request, (asked at 76K). 7) I'm guessing you're just dealing with a jerk. There are legitimate reasons the salary may be low, but no legitimate reasons for being huffy about someone respectfully point that out. I hope things work out in your favor! 8) No advice here, but the situation stinks and it sounds like you're handling it about as well as possible. All the best! (x2). 9) This seems like a giant red flag to me. Not necessarily from the salary standpoint, while not great feeling like you've been low-balled, the chair is probably in a tough position with the salary available. What would concern me is the reaction you got. If the chair is already coming off this way to a candidate, I would start to wonder about how he treats the faculty. Usually everyone is on their best behavior during interviews and negotiations, but he had no problem being upset when you (reasonably) asked about a higher salary with data to backup your request. Not sure I would be all that inclined to go there unless I didn't have any other opportuinities. Just a thought. x2 10) the ""bump"" in teaching requirements that you mentioned also seems to be something that could be indicative of a larger issue. How much of a difference are we talking about versus what you were led to believe in the interview? 11) Precarious situation. If already employed, I'd say just go talk to the dean instead. However, you don't want to start off on the wrong foot with the chair, if you decide to take the job. I personally do not believe chairs should be involved in negotiating beyond the role of an advisor to administration and an advocate for the candidate. My chair has personally screwed up multiple searches with his stupidity and inability to communicate and prioritize. Question: does the chair position at the university rotate regularly...or...is it more like a feaux head position that can pretty much be had for life? If rotates regularly, I wouldn't consider the chair at all in your decision making process, and I probably would ask to talk directly with a dean for further negotiation. Good luck. Let us know how it turns out. Just remember, you are negotiating with the university, not the chair. If he/she is a poor interemediary, ask to speak with someone up the chain of command. 12) I agree that your choices here may be different if the chair is likely to rotate out.  If they are offering you less than $75k at an R1 that is out of line unless it is super low cost of living.   You may want to mention it to the dean if you really want the job, but that is a risk of retaliation.   This guy either is trying to balance the budget on your back or he is trying to sabotage this search.  My chair advocates for us and would not do this.13) #1 here; thanks for the perspective. It's an interim chair. I don't want to undermine him because he'll be a colleague if I accept but I think he must be clueless on his role --I worry talking with the dean directly will stir up trouble--what are your thoughts? Also the teaching bump isn't awful, it was supposedly 1/1 but now says 1/2 bumped down to 1/1 if you have external funding (this raises my eyebrows but may not be a big deal?) & an extra grad course required every other year (that I wouldn't mind doing, just didn't really want in my contract if no one else has that spelled out). As of now, I'm considering taking a prestigous 2nd postdoc instead because of this start to the negotiations. But waiting to see. If I did go with this TT offer, I want to commit to succeeding there and not feel like I've sacrificed my own self worth & be looking to escape before tenure from the get go. I'm also concerned about the future of the department if this is what they pay. (sorry for the super long thread, readers!) 14) Is it a region of the country that you would really like to live? That pretty much trumps all for me. If you really want the job, I wouldn't worry too much about pissing off one colleague. x2 It's almost impossible to be besties with every single one of your colleagues. If this guy is an ass, chances are there are a lot of other colleagues that he doesn't get along with, as well. B/c you have the prestigous post doc in your back pocket, I suggest taking your time and asking for as much information possible. Maybe even ask for info on recent starting salaries in the department. Maybe the salaries are just really low at this school? If that's the case, it could be hard for the chair/dean to pay you considerably more than more senior faculty. There's still no excuse for the chair to be an ass about any of this. I don't know what's worse, having a bad negotiating experience or being ignorant on how to negotiate and getting rail-roaded. I was the latter 10+ years ago, and every new hire after me made more money than me until I received tenure/promotion. But then when they started receiving tenure/promotion, I was back to the bottom. Kudos to you for taking the negotiation process seriously, taking your time, and seeking help from other to be more well-informed. I wish I was as prepared when I hit the market. 15) I'm not sure if you have a sense of this or not, but a lot of interim chairs end up becoming permanent chairs, so it's something to consider. Are they actively searching for a chair at the moment? 16) Good luck and please let us know how it goes.   12 again) I've seen interim chairs do crappy negotiations.  Either b/c they don't want the job or because they think saving money will win them points or they just don't have the clout.   Talk to the dean, the search chair, or a senior professor you really felt was on your side if you want the job.  Failing the search is expensive in time, money, and losing a good candidate. It is likely someone there will want to help you.  17) How did this turn out? ",NA,

My understanding is that the structure (through NSERC, CIHR, and SSHRC) is different, typically in that a larger percentage of people are funded, but each gets a smaller amount of money. That will not deter me from applying, though. However, most (perhaps all?) Canadian universities are required to prefer Canadians in hiring, and typically ask you to include a statement in your cover letter stating your citizenship. Non-Canadians do still get hired though...

Yes, for sure living in Canada sounds amazing, and I would more there in no time, especially in this dark days. The kind of research that I do is at the intersection between evolutionary and biomedical genomics/epigenetics, so I am spoiled by NIH here in the U.S. But definitely gonna keep applying in Canada. I am aware of the fact the they preferably hire Canadians. However, the last two hires of a Department in which I recently applied were foreign. So it is doable. 5.) I'm currently a postdoctoral fellow in Canada, and I am from the US. There are funding opportunities here for non-Canadians, but permanent positions are pretty hard to come by if you're foreign (hiring preference as mentioned before). I have found small grants to fund my research, but I'm up in December myself. Canada is pretty awesome to live, high housing prices if you are around Toronto like me :). Good luck! 6) Canadian who did grad work in Canada here, echoing some of the earlier statements. The funding structure is just very different, so it can be difficult to compare, particularly to the US. For example, university-based startups are comparably low at Canadian institutions, but these can be supplemented by large CFI grants that have a relatively high success rate. Also, the tri-council grants emphasize very different things than NSF and NIH, and the schedules are very different—I know of at least one American PI that moved to Canada partly because of the substantially reduced pressure and time investment for grant writing. As for the hiring preference, I think in *most* cases, if they officially offer the job to a non-Canadian, they need to deem any Canadian candidates as “not qualified” (or something close to that). This mostly means that if their top choice declines, they can’t move down the list (although there is unofficial offers that don’t result in this). But this is just one factor that comprises the decision, and most committees just want the best candidate and lots of non-Canadians get hired (exhibit A: the recent program to poach mid-career non-Canadian talent: http://www.canada150.chairs-chaires.gc.ca/) 7) the Canada 150 program targeted Canadians working abroad, not non-Canadians 6) less than half (42%) announced chairs are Canadian 8) That may be, but it was not an effort to recruit non-Canadians. It was advertised as an effort to recruit Canadians working/educated abroad. 6) Check out the official press releases. While you are correct it did include mention of Canadian expats, the intent was to recruit international talent first and foremost.",NA,

NA,"advice letters of recommendation- Does anyone have any creative ways to ensure that you get your letters sent on time?  I've perrenially had a hard time getting letters sent, no amount of bugging seems to help either.  Its just busy folks, no issues other than that.  Any ideas?  Thanks (1) Give your writers at least a month's advance notice if possible.  Give them all the info they need in a clear format (highlight deadline).  Remind them one week before the deadline.  If they haven't said they sent it, ask again on the deadline.  Deal with their secretary if they have one.  Once they've sent one, it's really not much hassle for them to send more.  If the job means a lot to you, ask the secretary there to verify receipt of your letters.  On the bright side, no search committee in their right mind will immediately dismiss an otherwise excellent candidate for lack of a letter or two.  Buena suerte -- This is true, but as a member of a search committee this year (wiki user last few years) at this institution the search committee we never see your application until it is totally complete, including letters. We have an online submission system through HR and we won't know you exist unless your letters are in. We don't like it either.
(2) Make it as easy as possible on your letter writers.  E-mail them a list or table of all jobs with the deadlines, names of schools, addresses, contact names, job titles, and summaries of the job descriptions that highlight the parts most relevant to YOU.  Don't just send them copies of the ads.  That way, they can easily tailor their letters for the jobs and cut-and-paste the addresses and such into their letter template.
(3) Although hardly any biology folks do it, you can use a dossier service.  I have thought of doing this.  ",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Phone Interview I had a phone interview for a TT in a dream city.  These the questions they made: a) What was you contribution to science. b) Where would you find money for your research plan. c) How much competition do you have in your field. d) How would your research fit an Institution with PhD students and Master students. e) Which courses would you teach.  f) What equipment would you need.       I wasn't really expecting the first question, so I think I kind of blew such question. I said the right things, but sort of ranting and speaking way too long about it.   I did better in all the other questions, since I was kind of expecting them.  Do you think I might still have a hope? It was phone (no skpe) and the committee (three people) didn't comment anything in any of my answers. 2) Search committee members don't ordinarily comment on candidate answers in formal interviews. HR rules (and basic fairness) oblige them to treat all candidates the same, which means asking all candidates the same questions in the same order without further interaction.   3)Phone interviews are always awkward, especially when you can't tell who anyone is.  Try not to worry.  Enthusiasm is one factor they are looking for, so hopefully your rant conveyed that.  Do be prepared with a clear answer for your next interviews in person or otherwise.   Best of luck. 4) There is a view that phone interviews only matter if you really bomb or really impress and otherwise don't really change the rankings of the candidates from preliminary screenings 5) I agree with #4. Rarely have phone interviews changed pre-phone interview order dramatically, at least on the majority of searches I have been involved. Most of the questions in a phone/skype interview have already been addressed in the application packet. So unless your interpersonal skills are terrible, there is really not going to be a big change. I did see a candidate move up a bunch of spots after a phone interview when she went into more details about her experience involving students in research...something that she did not include in her application packet. But if that were in her packet originally, she would have been higher ranked originally. Considering most applicants have a good understanding of what should go into their packets, we stereotypically are not surprised one way or another in a phone interview, at least to the point that a big change in order will occur. Now, after saying that, there are some faculty that look at the phone interview as a clean slate; the order going in means nothing and everyone is on equal grounds. I hate that approach because I don't see how a phone interview importance is more important than what you have done to get to where you are. Honestly, I think phone interviews should only be used when there is a close call between candidates for campus invites. In most situations, I don't find distance interviews necessary. ",NA,

Depending on how many are interviewing, it can literally be hard to remember the first candidate,and search committee can be pretty burnt out by the end. 3) I've heard some take a ""save the best for last"" strategy. Keeps the top candidate happy if they get a quick turnaround on the offer. But I'm not sure I believe this is common. It is, however, nice to get a quick offer. 4) I think the search committee is very serious and it will not matter. I cancelled my campus interview two days prior due to international travel issues, they rescheduled me a month later and I was still offered the position (last candidate) 5) Been on numerous search committees. I can't remember the order of anyone we hired. I've also never been involved in setting the interviewee order. The interviewee order is all arranged by administrative assistants trying to fit a campus interview into everyone's schedule. 6) I would think the difference would be so small as to rarely affect the outcome. I agree with # 3, I'd much prefer to be last because I hate waiting for the outcome/offer after the interview... 7) I like being the first candidate ~ everyone is excited about the search and not as burnt out from endless talks and dinners as seems to happen later on 8) I got offers from schools I was the first, middle, and last candidate to interview. I think fit trumps order. 8)I've sat on multiple search committees. Order in which candidates are interviewed is determined by their availability + random happenstance. And search committees work very hard to treat all candidates the same way, whether they're interviewing first, last, or in the middle. Worrying about the spot you're interviewing in is just your brain's way of expressing anxiety about the interview outcome. 1 again) Thanks for all your comments everyone!

NA,"Job Market Does anyone else think this year's market is pretty bad?  There are not too many jobs that I'm even excited about, let alone ones I would be a good match for. (1) Actually, it's the opposite for me: there are already almost as many jobs that are a match for me as there were throughout last year, so I guess it may be related to sub-discipline.

(2) It's still early. Most of the jobs I applied for last year came out in the first week of October.   

(3) I just checked:  on the Physiological Ecology Job page from last year, by this date there were 44 jobs advertised.  To date, there are 47 jobs on this year's page.

(4) I concur with the OP. Hardly any relevant R1 jobs this year compared to last year.

(5) So, you seriously think that only R1 jobs are really jobs?

(6) I don't think that is what was meant by these statements. It really does not look like there are as many research-focused university jobs as last year. Instead, there are far more small liberal arts college jobs...

(7) My point (poster #4), not to take away from small liberal arts schools, is that there appear to be far less R1 jobs. I think using the total # of jobs as a metric does not really tell the story.                             

(8) Point taken.  However, there are 27 R1 jobs this year versus about 32 last year.  A slight difference, but not ""far less"".  There seems though, to be  a trend towards more jobs in organismal ecology, as apposed to ecosystem and molecular ecology, as was the case last year.

(9) being an organismal ecologist I'm thrilled.  I think a large chunk of jobs are opening with A&P attached, lots of folks returning to school for nursing these days!

(9) I looked up the Carnegie category of all the listings at http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/classifications/index.asp and added a column to the spreadsheet.  Looks like 14 tenure-track jobs at RU/VH (Research Universities (very high research activity), the new R1) and 8 at RU/H (Research Universities (high research activity), the new R2) to me.  Of course that doesn't count some very nice Canadian universities, which are not included in the Carnegie classification.  I don't feel like looking up last year's for comparison, but it seems down to me.

(10) Awesome! Thanks for doing that. A very informative category. I really appreciate the time that took.

(11) Ditto, thanks for doing that, very nice piece of info to have.

(12) I'll add my thanks, and comment that there are 96 RU/VH universities out there, and that, overall, some 18 places are now advertising about 20 TT jobs.  So,  almost 20% of these places have jobs available pretty early in the job season (and these generally advertise late).  It seems pretty good to me, especially in today's economy.  What are missing, of course:  the U of California system, and the Ivies.

Honestly, I think at this point they could ask for personal visits from our references and still get more applications than they can handle.
